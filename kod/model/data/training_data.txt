When our valet service guys are done for the day, they deliver the keys to the receptionist. She’ll then shoot an email to get our keys and encourage to leave work! Usually around 5pm.

There's a shrine with your picture on it. When the candles are lit all the employees gather around and worship as the meme lords please.  When the candles extinguish the meme dies and so fades into obscurity. Then its noon and time for lunch.

Not actually full-time job opportunities.  At least so far.  I like what I'm doing professionally outside of artwork.  But anything can change as long as something has even better pay and security in the future.  If I can make additional money off to the side with artwork- I say why not?   It's like having a second job that you actually like doing instead of toughing it out for only the paycheck.

They allowed Unidan to have an AMA on the main sub and he's really done shit-all outside of Reddit.

Favorite? Snorlax/Sloth blazed out in front of a celtic cross. Stuff I regretted?  The infamous rape sketch I suppose.  Even though I've drawn some that's equally fucked-up and rapey. Only difference is those "victims" were all male and they are explicit as fuck, but the one that caught extra attention (in large part due to the SRSers) happened to be an obscured female in a car.

Funny how the reasons people bashed the Woody Harrelson AMA for is exactly how AMA's are nowadays, yet there's not a majority uproar like back then. People show up to kiss ass. Now it's almost entirely PR/marketing and not done for genuine fan interest. "What do I think of chicken wings?

what a bunch of bullshit, they're so proud when a reddit writing prompt get's turned into a movie, so proud that Wired writes an article about it, so happy to bend over backwards for publicists trying to promote some shitty movie.  But snub people who haven't been a part of a hollywood production?  They gonna delete Pewdiepies AMA?  dunno if he ever tried but fuck him, he's only 'internet famous', doesn't matter if more people have seen his videos than have seen every superbowl ever* , oh by the way check out all those great commercials here on reddit!  Oh you want to share a comic you drew?

 When did you start enjoying the creation of sketches?  Still doing it after a couple years.  Which artists do you look up to?  I really don't have that much artistic influences. As long as they have a style that's different from others. I always loved HR Giger's stuff.  Have you ever started sketching something and then give up because it didn't turn out how you wanted it to?  Nope, never. I always redo it if looks too SNAFU'd to post.  The only times where I never post a finished result is when a submission gets lobbed off from Reddit. Which happens a lot.

Does your neck not hurt after a while on that setup? I recently got a dual monitor setup with my main monitor centered and the other to the right of it. More than 3 minutes of looking off to the side at the second monitor will start cramping my neck up.

My favorite sketch of yours was on a thread about what tattoos tattoo artists said no to and one consisted of this  This one girl came up into my store asking for a Snorlax and a three-toed sloth passing blunts to each other, with a Celtic cross behind them, with the snorlax playing a glass bong banjo, all in front of a pot leaf.

Do non-disclosure agreements typically forbid acknowledging the existence of the agreement?

Does it allow her to say "I signed a non-disclosure agreement?"  I don't know -- would have to ask a lawyer.  But I think it's reasonable to think that she would err on the side of caution and just steer clear of answering any questions that might invite legal scrutiny.

as much as I'd like to see this happen, chances are it won't. Last time we had a former reddit employee come in on an AMA, Yishan Wong himself (former CEO) showed up in the thread and made a huge ass of himself by calling out every single infraction and complaint registered about that employee out in the open. I doubt Victoria would want to risk that happening to her as well (and possibly ruining any chance at a different career in the same field she was in), seeing as her personal identity was closely associated to her activity on reddit and as an employee.

I agree with you wholeheartedly. If Reddit is to be an open forum, then /u/yishan has every right to call out some idiot who whined about being fired. I totally agreed with Yishan on doing that as well. You can publicly call out a company, but that means they can too.

true, he was badmouthing the company, and on it's own website no less. but at the same time it's insanely unprofessional to divulge that kind of information, especially in the way he did. If Yishan had just come out with a cool and level headed response, it would have been a different story. but with the response he gave, he was playing on the same level as the person doing the AMA.

I don't understand why everyone bitches about "professionalism". An ex-employee was acting out of line and he made the decision to intervene. He was the CEO at the time and had every right to handle the situation the way he decided to at the time.

Wong didn't make an ass out of himself; he fought fire with fire.  And he certainly did so in a surprisingly professional manner.  There was no tit-for-tat bullshit going on; he simply addressed all the bullshit, in one well-structured post. Just because the truth isn't always pretty, doesn't mean it should be sugarcoated.  Sometimes, blunt and to the point is the best way to go. Society would be so much better if everything was handled this way.

that was the complete opposite of professional. it was a borderline "fite me irl m8" post. I agree sometimes it's better to be blunt and objective. and that kind of situation was definitely one of them, but the response was in no way professional, especially for the fucking Chief Executive Officer of a company.

Then we're going to have to agree to disagree.  In situations like this, the "fucking Chief Executive Officer of a company" should be the one issuing the statement. Sorry, but as a businessman for decades, this is about as professional as you can get, while standing your ground against an abusive little fuckwit former employee.

Wow.. I guess everything she's been saying is no longer visible in her profile. I linked to a short post she replied to where someone asked her five questions, one of which was her feelings about getting fired.  She replied with one word: "Dazed!" Her other comments were subtle and it seemed like she did not want people to feel too bad for her - the fallout from her firing has been exponentially growing since a few hours ago, so I've no idea how things will be tomorrow.

Did you bring the girls up from the club? How much did they cost for the night? What else did you do in TJ? I think if I ever decide to pull a Leaving Las Vegas, this would be my style.

Yeah, I brought the girls up.  The club offered to send them in for me, but I quickly realized that meant they would send up only the girls who didn't drum up much business, so I started going downstairs and picking and choosing.   Roughly $60 an hour or $300 a night.  I didn't pay for the night.  I'd get a few girls, have some fun, then pass out for a few hours, get some food and water in me, and then pay for a few more girls.  Kept  cycling like that for about 5-6 days.

I was in a bad, bad state.  Really fucking BAD.  I don't think any of the girls were trafficked.  $60 was just the going rate.  From what I understand from research after the fact, they probably were not trafficked.   It's my shame that I might have participated in something horrific like that, but I think it was all legit.  Or as legit as it can be.   The women were definitely legal age.  Brothels are legal, or there's a legal loophole or something, and police were around keeping the order.  It wasn't like some back alley freakshow.

Mexican law doesn't prohibit or sanction prostitution, so in most cases it's all legal. What usually happens is that the State delegates the decision to municipalities, and municipalities usually have a red light district and are responsible for ensuring safety for everyone involved. At least in Tijuana, sex workers carry a health card and they are frequently checked for STDs. I grew up there.  Now, if you go to a back-alley girl, then that's your prerogative. And actually cops have been better at stopping the illegal prostitutes.

It's the guys with money that are the true drug fiends!  They can afford to chase the dragon. I'll check Erowid on 2c-b.  I've heard of it before.  Mostly I stick to LSD and mescaline these days.

Accountant here, can confirm.  Alas, I was saved by Video Games.  To this day, parents still can't decide what is more deadly to their kids: Coke or League of legends.

I'm an executive at a biotech firm... so... that's me. I hang with wealthy people, but I'm pretty sure that I'm the only one doing these types of drugs. I'm sure most of them, if not all of them, have some vice or another. Sometimes I wonder... or fantasize about making a service of sorts that caters to people's vices. That's just a fun day dream though. I don't need the legal hassle.

Wow, that is eye opening. I have realized in time that I was only using drugs because I felt bad inside. Same is probably true for those guys.

2c-b is absolutely amazing. It's kind of like acid mixed with MDMA but a lot less taxing on he body. Also, for some reason, it also makes me extremely aware of my teeth. It's one of my favorite drugs after DMT.  
That's how I am! I take drugs too. I also make good money. Both help, but we will always be fucked up. Look into the drug "2c-b". You will like that one, and it's much easier on your system than fucking coke.   
I don't want to be condescending here, as I'm sure many of you are aware of this, but 2cb is crazily potent! we're talking milligram-tens of milligram quantities to get a decent high (as opposed to hundereds of milligrams for substances like MDMA). you can easily overdose if you don't have a clue as to what you're taking. just be fucking careful and if you have to take it, get a good balance to weigh it out! Also, I've heard it's one of the most painful things that you can snort...

this. THIS THIS THIS! what a completely hilarious idea to post something like "check out something called 2-cb" in a coke-affiliated post on depression and suicide! you snort 2-cb by a few milligrams, not actual lines. KIDS, BEWARE! seriously. i've seen what happens when this drugs gets confused with another and BAM. so not funny.  goddamit, dude. EDIT: 2-cb is a very very interesting drug, very potent, but in a good way. but DO NOT JUST USE IT LIKE IT'S COKE OR EVEN SPEED DON'T DO THIS

Are you in the US?   Google NAMI and find your local chapter.  (national Alliance o Mental Illness).   They won't get you drugs but thy will get you free group therapy and provide info for all the programs out there you could be taking advantage of to deal with your problems.

One girl was down for some lezzy shit but the other wasn't, so I offered her an extra $50 if she'd let the first girl go down on her while I fucked lezzy from behind.  Something about a straight girl getting eaten out by another girl just  drives me up the fucking wall.   I don't know if that's the kind of nasty you're thinking of, but that was definitely my favorite moment.

Ha! Many years ago was in a similar place, made similar choices with similar results. Today I still have depression but the bottom line is I'm curious as to what the fuck happens next. Life is an adventure. That doesn't mean "fun," that means "adventure." This world is full of surprises. I first considered suicide when I was ten, 45 years ago. Since then I have seen things... a naked girl, machine guns in anger pointed at me, True Love, betrayal, real love. I have French kissed a French girl on a boat sailing across the Adriatic. I have crossed the finish line in regattas ahead of America's Cup skippers. I have sat alone on a tall mountaintop and watched storm clouds boil beneath me. I have known women who were and are truly special to me. I am old but last week I raced a truly fast motorcycle on a racetrack faster than I have ever gone. And I have held a pistol to my head many times. Any day I can choose to leave. many times, countless times, I have considered it. Tonight, sitting here, right now I have a lovely Colt Defender Lightweight I bought in 2011 (100th anniversary of 1911). I just this moment, between sentences, thought of adding that final punctuation to my life. the thing is, I can't wait to see what comes next. I'm only 55, dammit. In 20 or 30 or 40 years my body will betray me and quit. GODDAMIT! Only 40 more years? I really want to see the ghosts of the Ayn Rand worshipers talk their way out of the coming droughts and polar thaws. I want to see the Canadians gasp as the Columbus Blue Jackets win the Stanley Cup from the Bogata Bombers. Depression sucks. Sure. Meds help. Sure. The bottom line, as in Hamlet, is choosing whether you choose to participate. "To be or not to be..." WTF do you think he was talking about? Life isn't pretty, but dude, it has flavor. edit- typo

Glad I stuck around, too. I firmly believe every man should have a threesome once before he dies, and since threesomes probably won't happen naturally, I say put aside a happy-time fund.  20 a month until you have $700.  that's about the going rate for two women in the US.

I have a related story. From this past weekend on Day of the Dead, actually. I probably left my house to hang out with people 3-5 times within a 4 year period. This girl I went to high school with messaged me on Facebook wanting to hang out. I agreed and she offered going to an edm festival for Halloween weekend. I told her I was broke, and raves weren't my thing. A couple of days later, my dad wins 2 tickets for the exact festival she invited me too. I message her and tell her the news and plan to go! Anxiety ensued for the entire week as Halloween weekend approached. I barely knew this chick and now I'm going from cave to rave! What!? I drive to her friends house day of and meet them. They were both super chill and we started dabbing. They ask if ill be taking any drugs that night. I told them I haven't had anything really but weed since forever but I was down for anything. I was convinced this would help with my depression and I made it a point to stay positive. Before we left we did a line a coke for my first time and took a molly. By the time we got in, we did coke every 30 minutes, bought strong extacy pill and our night was set. I was having the best damn time of my life with this girl I didnt even know. I was awkward and apologized for being an unsocial freak. She was totally understanding and even took good care of me when I was feeling overwhelmed. It changed my feelings towards people and my life. There were so many kind people and crazy people! I felt free to be crazy yet understood for the first time. She even wants to hang out again! I think shes the friend that could pull me out of this. I know no one will probably read this but it felt good to write it out! Thanks for the story OP. Depression is one hell of a journey.

      Penetration test:     A penetration test, or the short form pentest, is an attack on a computer system with the intention of finding security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to it, its functionality and data.   The process involves identifying the target systems and the goal, then reviewing the information available and undertaking available means to attain the goal. A penetration test target may be a white box (where all background and system information is provided) or black box (where only basic or no information is provided except the company name). A penetration test can help determine whether a system is vulnerable to attack, if the defenses were sufficient and which defenses (if any) were defeated in the penetration test.  A penetration can be likened to surveying a rabbit proof fence, which must be whole to keep the rabbits out. In surveying the fence the penetration tester may identify a single hole large enough for a rabbit (or themselves) to move through, once the defense is passed, any further review of that defense may not occur as the penetration tester moves on to the next security control. This means there may be several holes or vulnerabilities in the first line of defense and the penetration tester only identified the first one found as it was a successful exploit. This is where the difference lies between a vulnerability assessment and penetration test - the vulnerability assessment is everything that you may be susceptible to, the penetration test is based on if your defense can be defeated. [citation needed] Security issues uncovered through the penetration test are presented to the system's owner. [citation needed] Effective penetration tests will couple this information with an accurate assessment of the potential impacts to the organization and outline a range of technical and procedural countermeasures to reduce risks. [citation needed] Penetration tests are valuable for several reasons: [citation needed]  Determining the feasibility of a particular set of attack vectors Identifying higher-risk vulnerabilities that result from a combination of lower-risk vulnerabilities exploited in a particular sequence Identifying vulnerabilities that may be difficult or impossible to detect with automated network or application vulnerability scanning software Assessing the magnitude of potential business and operational impacts of successful attacks Testing the ability of network defenders to successfully detect and respond to the attacks Providing evidence to support increased investments in security personnel and technology  Penetration tests are a component of a full security audit. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and security and auditing standard, requires both quarterly and ongoing penetration testing (after system changes).

I did not plan on it being anything,  so I left Chicago and moved to Dallas,  got a job at Intel Security which at the time was McAfee.  I learned Linux when I was younger due to it being easier to compile and execute Perl and Python scripts etc.   McAfee SIEM takes off as a project,  I learn a ton about all sort of network devices cause SIEM touches all of them.

any lasting side effects? how much money did this whole ordeal end up costing you?  for some reason I have a feeling this exact situation will happen to me at least once in my life

I had a death wish, so I was stumbling through the streets drunk at 2am.  I went down alleys and everything else.  It was creepy as fuck, but nothing happened to me.  Probably dumb luck. I think if you stick to the populated touristy areas you'll be completely safe.  There are LOTS of cops there.  It was funny, but outside of every major brothel there were always a bunch of cops standing around to keep order.

I'm glad you're still around, but shit, that's ballsy, man. What ethnicity are you? I'm Hispanic, but you couldn't pay me enough to walk down those streets. And it sucks, cause I kinda need to go down there to get some dental work done. Last time I went, I was 16 years old or so and had a group of guys in a truck pointing their rifles at me cause I had long hair at the time.

Part Hispanic, but not enough that they didn't all know I was a gringo.   I wasn't ballsy.  I just didn't care what happened to me.  It was like playing a first person version of Grand Theft Auto.  Totally did not give a shit about anything.

It's like CPR.  If a person's dead, you do whatever you can to bring them back up to and including breaking their ribs, right?   It's for extreme, emergency measures.  I was going to kill myself that night, but I didn't, and it was worth it.  Not worth it if you can get yourself into therapy and work on your problems the right way, tho

I can't defend the cow in question but I believe that while cow crime IS on the rise, it is most likely due to extrinsic factors, as the vast majority of cows are docile and friendly, more research should be put into cow communities to understand the psyche and reasoning a rogue cow has.

Pizza Dad speaking: he likes plain cheese. He wasn't  conditioned too. He used to like toppings. But now he picks everything off.  Some universal foods I've learned kids tend to like are, plain pizza, chicken nuggets, mac n cheese, hotdogs, and prime rib roast (jk...unless they have excellent taste) add chips to any of those and most kids will like something. Sandwiches can very from kid to kid.

In preschool my kid gave a mildly creepy answer "I was invisible.  I turned pink so you and mommy could find me.   In 100 years I will turn invisible again.  You won't see me anymore." Upon further prying he told me "in infinity years I'll come back again and make a new Sun so you can find me again" [after I tried explaining even the Sun would burn out in only a few billion years; and previously having tried to explain "infinity" from the Toy Story quote]..

If you're willing to break character, I'd love to know what inspired you to make this absolutely legendary troll account, and what went into creating the character that was Sal Bundry?  
I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days. The reason I'm ending my trolling is because this was, by a long shot, my favorite characterization, and I don't see myself gaining any further satisfaction from any other idea at this time. Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal. I received so many messages of love and hate! An important point to mention: given my history of working with people with mental illness, I was careful about going over the line. If I thought I had done so, I would shoot a PM to the user. I did this as recently as 1 or 2 days prior to the suspension of my account. Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.

Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.  
Holy shit. Were you GivesFreeCompliments or one of those types? I really wish I could know if I ever saw your comments from your positive account

First thing I thought, too. That ban was really unfair.

I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days. The reason I'm ending my trolling is because this was, by a long shot, my favorite characterization, and I don't see myself gaining any further satisfaction from any other idea at this time. Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal.

God damn, that was really well written. I’m glad that there’s actually a positive motivation, and I think the overall message is great. Thanks for making us laugh, and best of luck in the future.

WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!  But seriously, hearing you speak out of character is exactly what I hoped and envisioned.  I love your work and will miss you.  Keep fighting the good fight.  Love is the answer.

Wow... I don’t even know what else to say. You’re a good person, and your contributions will be missed. And I guess since this is probably goodbye, I should probably also thank you for all the laughs at times where I really needed it. Those five touchdowns made my day better so many times when I needed something stupid and trivial and funny to laugh about. Many times you gave me (and so many others) a desperately-needed escape from the real world, if only for a moment. You brought a lot of joy to a lot of people’s lives, and I hope you always remember that. So thank you, Sal, for being the most memorable troll to ever score five touchdowns in one game of American football back in high school.

Oh god Sal I can’t believe you’re really leaving us, I’m actually tearing up. I want you to know much you brightened my days on Reddit, I loved every single one of your comments that I stumbled across and all the football memes. The message in this comment here especially touched me, I’m not surprised you’re such a good person behind the façade as well. Maybe it’s weird that I feel so strongly about a person I don’t even know but it doesn’t feel like I barely know you Sal. It feels like you’re my friend, and I’m really going to miss you.

Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.  
I got sal’d once and I hated it at the time but eventually I grew to love Sal and his special trolls. Way to go bro. Good on you  
I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days. The reason I'm ending my trolling is because this was, by a long shot, my favorite characterization, and I don't see myself gaining any further satisfaction from any other idea at this time. Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal. I received so many messages of love and hate! An important point to mention: given my history of working with people with mental illness, I was careful about going over the line. If I thought I had done so, I would shoot a PM to the user. I did this as recently as 1 or 2 days prior to the suspension of my account. Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy.

Thank you for bringing this amazing character to Reddit! As a person who struggles with mental illness, I never realized how much trolls actually distract from my intrusive thoughts.  This message has definitely taught me a lot. I wish you all the best in life and luck in your career!

I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.  
👏👏👏  
I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days. The reason I'm ending my trolling is because this was, by a long shot, my favorite characterization, and I don't see myself gaining any further satisfaction from any other idea at this time. Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal. I received so many messages of love and hate! An important point to mention: given my history of working with people with mental illness, I was careful about going over the line. If I thought I had done so, I would shoot a PM to the user. I did this as recently as 1 or 2 days prior to the suspension of my account. Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal.

Fully agree with the philosophy, this comment should be a whole post pinned to the f'in whole site

You're a good man Sal. Just want to say thanks for all the laughs you've given us and hope your career goes well. Still sucks that it's all ending, but who knows, maybe someday we'll see the legend himself make a triumphant comeback.

I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal. I received so many messages of love and hate! An important point to mention: given my history of working with people with mental illness, I was careful about going over the line. If I thought I had done so, I would shoot a PM to the user. I did this as recently as 1 or 2 days prior to the suspension of my account. Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.  
 What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do.  Why is this literally word-for-word the same post as /u/FunkThePunk 's comment 15 days ago?  
I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days. The reason I'm ending my trolling is because this was, by a long shot, my favorite characterization, and I don't see myself gaining any further satisfaction from any other idea at this time. Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs.

Sal, what do you think of rugby as compared to american football? In my opinion, a man of your skill would greatly improve without the need of protection, in favor of superior speed as to score more touchdowns.

I won't lie when I say that ragby is a good sport, but it's still nothing compared to American football. The strategies and formations used in American football are far more elusive and require more critical thinking in very short time frames then any other sport in existence. Only men of truly high entellegence, agility, strength, speed, handsomeness, charisma, and teamwork can succeed at a sport as substantial as football. The reisin that football requires hell mats is because it is so much rougher then ragby. Just think about.

That's all? I would of beet them up in a heart beet.

Sal, was your goals always 500,000 or were you going to attempt to reach 1,000,000 or beyond befor you were cut down unjustly? And also a follow up, any messages to the new generation of people  who are bound follow in your path in what you do here on reddit

One of my favorite peeple, the Profit of Weasely! Tank you for the question. My original goal was never to obtain any downloads at all. It appears that the peeple did not understand the wisdom that emenated from my keyboard at which I had typed (and which I am still using (I can't afford another one (the economy's rough and I'm not getting payed enough (something which my big red lazy wife refuses to understand (she keeps begging me for the sex and money (neither of which I have nor do I want to give her)))))), and as a result, they had downloaded me. It was very shocking. However, I alter understood that the downloads were a sign that my teachings were being understood and appreciated. Teaching is never easy, and someone who wants to learn must feel the pain of being wrong in order to learn. If that means I receive a download, than so be it, as long as my lessons come through clear and wide, much like the passes I received in order to score my touchdowns (of which I scored 5 in 1 game in high school in 1969 (still an unbeeten record)). As a result, I became proud of my downloads. Once I reached 500,000 downloads I understood that I had broken through to many peeple. I had contributed to my goal of Reviving Rebbit. My advice to the new generations (including melleneials and generation Zika kiddies) is to listen to the older peeple's advice. They've been around for a long time and have seen things that your yet to learn. They may not always be right, and they might be stuck in there old ways, but there worth listening to, because by listening to there life experience, you might be able to avoid making the same miss steaks they made. Especially marriage. Marriage is the biggest miss steak that any man can make. Don't get marred, boys. Just make the sex at as many young, single girls as you possibly can and run away. You'll live a much heppier life.

Inspiring words as always Saint Bundry. Us as the r/churchofwesley thank you for your service to us and to all of reddit. Your teachings will not go in vain, and songs of your glorious touchdowns will be sang throughout the Halls of Ford for all time. Tonight we Hail you Sir, and dedicate today Nov 3rd to be Saint Bundrys Day a celebration filled with all the beer and poon a man can ask for in your honor. May your memory live on forever,  Hail Ford, and Hail Bundry!!!!!!

Think about it this way: I scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game, and I collected 500,000 downloads on 1 Rebbit account. Now, I also scored plenty of touchdowns in other games, but I am not counting those in the game in which I scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game, because it's a different game. Anal ogously, creating a new Rebbit account is the same as starting a new game. I'm heppy with the 5 touchdowns I scored in my final game, and am heppy with what I had done on my original Rebbit account. I have Revived Rebbit, and I trust that my followers will carry on my legend. It is how the world works: the young stand on the shoulders (which, in football players like me, are very wide and strong (tanks to the hours of strength training, practice, and amazing jeans passed down from my parents)) of the old and move the world forward.

Well, BaseballJon, as it turns out my future redhead of a wife, Pug (or as I'd call her when I'm trying to calm her, Puggy), was my exclusive girlfriend at the time. The lucky broad snatched me and she was the only one I slept with that night. But I'll tell you, I will tell you this, I'll tell ya, she got a Sallin' 5 (five) times like no other five (5) women could handle in there lifetimes. This 9.83" SALamander (that's big, folks) is as good as they come.

She defiantly is. Woman doesn't know how good she has it, what with all the money I bring back home, the housework I do, the manliness that emanates from my body as I come home from a long day of sandalhorning tight sandals onto the flippers of whales that demand to be called womans.  
Well, BaseballJon, as it turns out my future redhead of a wife, Pug (or as I'd call her when I'm trying to calm her, Puggy), was my exclusive girlfriend at the time. The lucky broad snatched me and she was the only one I slept with that night. But I'll tell you, I will tell you this, I'll tell ya, she got a Sallin' 5 (five) times like no other five (5) women could handle in there lifetimes. This 9.83" SALamander (that's big, folks) is as good as they come.  
Do you really expect us to believe you use decimal inches? I think you're not the real Sal Bundry! You're a European imposter who doesn't know our more perfect measurement system!  
Sal, there are rumors that on the night that you threw 5 tds in one game you also slept with 5 women in one night...is this true?  
As a man who never told a lie I can say this is indeed true

I was waiting for this one! I have many personnel favorites, but this one takes the cack. I was working on variations of it for a few months (a month is between 28 (twenty eight) and 32 (thirty to) days (meaning I worked on it over a period of more then 28 to 32 days)). I will add some more favorites later on because I have many questions hear, and I can't answer them all at once (I'm only one man (something I wish my wife understood when she begs me to bring home money and make the sex at her and do the housework)). Others commints and posts I liked: 1 (one) 2 (two) 3 (tree) 4 (for) 5 (five (scroll down for this one - it's neer the bottom)) 6 (sex) 7 (seven)

Sal - first off I want to say that I will greatly miss you. Not only was ur football career cut short unfairly but s was ur rebbit career. My question for you is how do we revive rebbit with u gone? U led this whole operation but now we are losing you...  On a lighter note any predictions for the pats ravens game?

I will always be in you're hearts and minds. You have seen what I have done, and while nobody can be as legendary as I am, you can follow my footsteps and do as I have done. Let the name of Sal ring through the threads of Rebbit forever! Do not let the name or the touchdowns (of which I scored 5 in 1 game in high school) ever be forgotten as long as you are a Rebbitor. Their is no doubt in my mind that the Patriots will win. There just giving the Ravings an easy 1rd (first) half game in order to fool them.

Why did you pick Cheers Married with Children as your inspiration for the troll account?  
As it turns out, that tevelision show was inspired by me! I scored my 5 touchdowns in 1 game in high school in 1969, and that show came around nearly 20 (twenty) years later. I find it silly that you'd think my life was expired by something created long after I'd gone through the best years of my life. I don't think you understand how time works, bucko. Something that hapins after something else hapins after it, not before it. The thing that hapins after is inspired by the thing before it, not the other way around. Because something that takes before can't be effected by something that takes place after it because time doesn't go backwards (unless we have a time machine (and my only time machine is my mammory (which I have to visit often to escape the horror of my daily life and daily wife (I often remember scoring 5 touchdowns in 1 game (it's undoubtedly the best mammory I ever had))))).

I am a busy man who has a wife, kids, and a job selling sandals to women so obees, they have changed the earth's gravitational forces to the extent that it might start hurdling towards the sun. I hope that would be the case, because that would mean my misery as a marred man will soon end. But in the meantime, this is all I have: a wife and kids, but at least I have Sunday football and my dog Fuck Bundry to keep my company. To those who want to be as successful as me: practice football. Practice hard. Make sure you're parents give you good jeans so you can inherit the ideal strength, handsomeness, and entellegence you need to play football like a star. Never get marred, and always be shellfish (accept when you play football) because in this lifetime, your the only person you have to care for yourself. And praise the one man (me (Sal Bundry)) who is humble enough to score 5 touchdowns in 1 game, yet still come hear and give out this sage wisdom to everyone.

I appreciate you're support. It is reassuring to know that someone appreciates the words of a man who has scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game in high school (something which no human has ever replicated or can ever do again). If only the rest of Rebbit saw things the way you do (the correct way), things may have turned out differently, but such is the curse of a Bundry. A true artist (like me) can only be appreciated after his deaf.

Why didn't you score 6 touchdowns in one game? Are you too weak?  
Why didn't you score 6 touchdowns in one game? Are you too weak?  
Football is a game of teamwork. In order to achieve the highest score possible for my team, I had to share some of my potential touchdowns with my teammates. That's the magic of football: you have to create plays that involve not only yourself, but everyone else. Shellfishness would only lead to a lower score for my team. This is the sacrifice that I, the mighty Sal Bundry, made for the glory of my team. It is the reisin that, even though I could of done better, my achievement is still renowned worldwide.

A Rod Rogers is the only reisin that the Green Gay Pickers are still a team at all. He keeps the rest of his players employed (otherwise they'd probably be stuck working at MacDormand's or Booger King or Wender's). He's a grate quarterbacker, but still not even close to being as legendary and innately talented as Tom Brody (who is truly a football God).

What is the Bundry Creedo?  
Vegetables are for chickens. When one Bundry hurts himself, the rest of us laugh. Sal Bundry is cursed, but Sal Bundry never quits because a quitter does not score 5 touchdowns in 1 game. We don't call the coppers. We beet 'em up. The wife sucks you're life. The wife kicks you in the pricks. The wife baits, the wife haits. The wife is not on man's level, the wife is the devi. Girls that are young, girls that are dumb. Pump 'em, dump 'em, you'll be number one.

Sal “Salami Bun” Bundry, how big are your nuts?  
I wish I could afford nuts, but on this salary all I have is my hand to suck on. But if your referring to my manly twins down under, I'll recopy what I once said about them 7 (seven) months ago: Real men (like the Bundry men) don't have saggy balls. Our bongos are made of hard, cold steel. That's why I always played high school football without any gear on, and I scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game (a record that's NEVER been beaten to this day). Although I'm a lowly sandal salesman on, here's one thing I can tell ya: if you tried to kick a Bundry in the jingles, you'd not only break your foot - you wouldn't live to see the next day. Don't mess with the Bundrys. Whooooooa Bundry!

Sal, what will you be up to after your legendairy Rebbit (social media platform) career ends?  
Still marred to my horrible wife, living my horrible life, taking care of my horrible kids, working my terrible job. What's a man to do but suffer the agony of his life choices? If only I could go back to the days of innocently playing high school football and beeting up nerds. Those days, before marriage, truly the good times. The times I wish I appreciated more.  
My parents homeschooled me and my little brother to shelter us from "the gays." We both ended up transgender and my older brother is gay. AMA
How did they take that?   
How did they take that?   
Pretty horribly. My older brother called my dad and told him. He responded “WHAT? I’M GOING TO HANG UP SO I DON’T SAY SOMETHING I REGRET” a month later he talked to him about it, gave him a Bible, told him he was going to hell, never to mention it, and continuously tells him that he can change and he needs to have a wife one day. My mom used to always tell me “he thinks it’s not a choice, but we know better than that.” I’m not out as trans because of the reaction they had with my little brother (I’m waiting until I’m out of the house), but they know that I’m attracted to girls. I wrote a six page letter explaining everything and a week later my dad forced me to talk to him about it. He told me the same thing he told my brother. He said he will never accept it “You made good points, but I feel like God is testing me so I will never accept it.” I cut my hair at the beginning of the year and occasionally he brings it up because I’m “rubbing it in his face” and sometimes threatens to kick me out because of it. My relationship with him has never been the same since. I’m scared of him now. My mom just ignores it mostly and we’ve gotten closer, but mostly agrees with him. My little brother already had short hair when I came out as gay so my dad figured something was up. Right after he made me talk to him, he forced my little brother to come out to him. He came out to him as nonbinary (months later he realized he’s actually ftm). There were weeks of yelling. Weeks of “YOU’RE MENTALLY ILL. YOU NEED THERAPY.” He posted on Instagram that night that he was afraid he was going to be sent to conversion therapy because that’s what had been threatened whenever the topic of transgender people was brought up. Eventually that calmed down a little bit, but when we were on vacation he decided to bring it up every time someone didn’t immediately gender him female. Because of this, he got his phone taken away. They went through it and saw that he was also panromantic and asexual (and had a girlfriend). More yelling and threatening conversion therapy. They kept his phone until he started acting cis and straight. His phone was gone for almost a year. He still doesn’t have internet access and they constantly look through his phone. They delete every contact who calls him by his preferred name/pronouns. Now he has long pink hair and only wears female clothes (including skirts) along with make up and painted nails. I was called mentally ill when I defended him (all I did was say that it shouldn’t matter what section he gets his clothes from). This past year I have been so scared that we’ll find him dead one day. He always jokes about suicide and he’s told me that he wants to give himself top surgery and doesn’t care if he bleeds out. He’s that desperate for a flat chest. Every time he does so much as wear multiple sports bras, the yelling will start again.

Unbelievable. I'm so sorry you're in that situation, it's stories like these that make me scared every time I come out or someone. I really hope you and them end up happy, all the best

In all fairness, you guys might be mentally ill. But PTSD is a bigger worry to me than gender disphorea.  I was talking to a friend today about this sort of thing. Part of the social problem in Western culture is that we treat mental illnesses like they're a defect in the human condition, and that they need curing. You could just as easily argue that belief in an invisible and unknowable deity is a mental illness. The ability to ignore purely rational logic in favor of personal experience should be a diagnostic indication for mental illness.  And yet that's accepted as normal mental functioning. Maybe there is a God that hates homosexuality. Maybe he also hates shellfish and shirts with mixed fibers. If we accept that he loves us and died for us, we should also be able to accept that he died for Red Lobster as much as for pride parades.  And if being queer is an affliction of the mind, like schizoaffective disorder or bipolar spectrum disorder, or autism, or cerebral palsy, or downs syndrome, or even just boring old depression, then all those other people are abominations too.  And that seems a bit... Extreme. Does God need to forgive someone for their bipolar issues? It seems like a stretch.  Either way, it doesn't seem like God would be for torturing your children because of their sexuality. Were the sodomites destroyed because they did butt stuff, or because they wanted to rape angels? I dunno, but one of those things seems a little worse than the other. God seems pretty offended by "abusers of mankind," but I'm not sure that the things lovers do can be called abuse.  I think the things you describe your father doing can be described as abuse, though. Mental abuse, surely. If your child asks for bread, do you give him a stone? Is that what God is to him? Wrath and stones? Jesus had some pretty strong silent moments with people who picked up stones once.

Believing in your invisible best friend in the sky makes you crazy.   Believing in my invisible best friend in the sky makes you normal. This is why we can't have nice things.

Believing in your invisible best friend in the sky makes you crazy.   Believing in my invisible best friend in the sky makes you normal. This is why we can't have nice things.  
I mean, I think phrasing people's beliefs as 'an invisible man in the sky'  is also part of why we can't have nice things. Everytime I see it, I wonder what point you think you're making by offending people.  And the guy you're replying to is an absolute dick, I agree. But that's no reason to go straight to something so childish.

I just wanted to come by and give you props for the most scriptural defense of queer identities I have ever heard. Thank you. I was on the fence about this particular topic, and your post pushed me over to the side of "being queer is not a sin in God's eyes". And now I feel like that stance is not just feeling based, but based in scripture as well.

So, I think if you look really hard at the ten commandments, you see two kinds of sin. Sins against God and sins against community. We're told not to have other gods before God or blaspheme him, and to keep the Sabbath. Not to lie, cheat, steal, or covet, to honor our parents, and not to murder anyone, and not to commit adultery. Pretty easy stuff.  But there's a third kind of sin. Sins against yourself. The kind of self damaging stuff that drags you down. There's a lot of ways to avoid those sorts of sins in the book of Proverbs. You could argue homosexuality is a sin against your community or yourself, but I think absolution would typically be found in those places as well.  I think the most compelling argument is that arguing who someone loves is a choice would mean that basically everyone is a psychopathic bisexual. And that's clearly preposterous. So then, if God made someone gay or mentally ill, then at worst, we should pray for their healing, and at best, we should accept them for who they are and treat them with the same love and kindness expected towards everyone.

It's emotional and verbal abuse. You made some good points, but lost me when you questioned if it was abuse and then conceded slightly that it could be mental abuse. It's abusive. OP mentioned fear and living in constant fear is indicative of an abusive homelife. Not being able to be honest without getting yelled at is intimidation and intimidating your children to bend to your will every day and punishing any other behvaior is abusive.

I think you misunderstood the last paragraph and the line leading up to it. I don't know if what lovers do can be abuse line particularly was just a poetic way to put it riffing off of abusers of mankind, they're not questioning the abuse being done to OP.   
Pretty horribly. My older brother called my dad and told him. He responded “WHAT? I’M GOING TO HANG UP SO I DON’T SAY SOMETHING I REGRET” a month later he talked to him about it, gave him a Bible, told him he was going to hell, never to mention it, and continuously tells him that he can change and he needs to have a wife one day. My mom used to always tell me “he thinks it’s not a choice, but we know better than that.” I’m not out as trans because of the reaction they had with my little brother (I’m waiting until I’m out of the house), but they know that I’m attracted to girls. I wrote a six page letter explaining everything and a week later my dad forced me to talk to him about it. He told me the same thing he told my brother. He said he will never accept it “You made good points, but I feel like God is testing me so I will never accept it.” I cut my hair at the beginning of the year and occasionally he brings it up because I’m “rubbing it in his face” and sometimes threatens to kick me out because of it. My relationship with him has never been the same since. I’m scared of him now. My mom just ignores it mostly and we’ve gotten closer, but mostly agrees with him. My little brother already had short hair when I came out as gay so my dad figured something was up. Right after he made me talk to him, he forced my little brother to come out to him. He came out to him as nonbinary (months later he realized he’s actually ftm). There were weeks of yelling. Weeks of “YOU’RE MENTALLY ILL. YOU NEED THERAPY.” He posted on Instagram that night that he was afraid he was going to be sent to conversion therapy because that’s what had been threatened whenever the topic of transgender people was brought up. Eventually that calmed down a little bit, but when we were on vacation he decided to bring it up every time someone didn’t immediately gender him female. Because of this, he got his phone taken away. They went through it and saw that he was also panromantic and asexual (and had a girlfriend). More yelling and threatening conversion therapy. They kept his phone until he started acting cis and straight. His phone was gone for almost a year. He still doesn’t have internet access and they constantly look through his phone. They delete every contact who calls him by his preferred name/pronouns. Now he has long pink hair and only wears female clothes (including skirts) along with make up and painted nails. I was called mentally ill when I defended him (all I did was say that it shouldn’t matter what section he gets his clothes from). This past year I have been so scared that we’ll find him dead one day. He always jokes about suicide and he’s told me that he wants to give himself top surgery and doesn’t care if he bleeds out. He’s that desperate for a flat chest. Every time he does so much as wear multiple sports bras, the yelling will start again.  
I just wanna say that this was a bit confusing to read, no hate against any of you but clarifying everyone's "cis" gender or whatever in the beginning would help make this a lot more readable.

My heart breaks for you and your brothers. I'm a trans man and I shared a lot of those feelings with your little brother, but I was lucky to have supportive family and friends. Please look after each other.  If it is possible for your little brother to see a trans friendly counsellor without your parents finding out I highly recommend it.  He needs a good support network and having his phone taken away and no internet access makes that extremely difficult. If he gets access back Telegram is an Instant Messenger that allows a password and the option to have chats delete themselves when closed or after a period of time.  I'm sure there are similar apps.  That's a truly awful situation and straight up abusive. People may argue it isn't abuse, but personally knowing dysphoria and seeing similar situations for other trans people it's extremely abusive and more importantly deadly. Always take his mentions of suicide and self harm seriously.   If it is possible for him to move out and at the very least transition in terms of hair, clothing, social factors, etc he should. Even if your parents threaten to cut him off, he should. His own wellbeing is more important than abusive family. Take care. I'm very concerned and I hope things get better soon.

There's Telegram and Signal being the popular ones. I vote for Signal because it defaults to end-to-end encryption while Telegram does not. If he deletes Signal, it's all gone. I hope things don't go to hell OP. I'm sorry your dad is opting to shut his family out instead of helping it to grow.  
Pretty horribly. My older brother called my dad and told him. He responded “WHAT? I’M GOING TO HANG UP SO I DON’T SAY SOMETHING I REGRET” a month later he talked to him about it, gave him a Bible, told him he was going to hell, never to mention it, and continuously tells him that he can change and he needs to have a wife one day. My mom used to always tell me “he thinks it’s not a choice, but we know better than that.” I’m not out as trans because of the reaction they had with my little brother (I’m waiting until I’m out of the house), but they know that I’m attracted to girls. I wrote a six page letter explaining everything and a week later my dad forced me to talk to him about it. He told me the same thing he told my brother. He said he will never accept it “You made good points, but I feel like God is testing me so I will never accept it.” I cut my hair at the beginning of the year and occasionally he brings it up because I’m “rubbing it in his face” and sometimes threatens to kick me out because of it. My relationship with him has never been the same since. I’m scared of him now. My mom just ignores it mostly and we’ve gotten closer, but mostly agrees with him. My little brother already had short hair when I came out as gay so my dad figured something was up. Right after he made me talk to him, he forced my little brother to come out to him. He came out to him as nonbinary (months later he realized he’s actually ftm). There were weeks of yelling. Weeks of “YOU’RE MENTALLY ILL. YOU NEED THERAPY.” He posted on Instagram that night that he was afraid he was going to be sent to conversion therapy because that’s what had been threatened whenever the topic of transgender people was brought up. Eventually that calmed down a little bit, but when we were on vacation he decided to bring it up every time someone didn’t immediately gender him female. Because of this, he got his phone taken away. They went through it and saw that he was also panromantic and asexual (and had a girlfriend). More yelling and threatening conversion therapy. They kept his phone until he started acting cis and straight. His phone was gone for almost a year. He still doesn’t have internet access and they constantly look through his phone. They delete every contact who calls him by his preferred name/pronouns. Now he has long pink hair and only wears female clothes (including skirts) along with make up and painted nails. I was called mentally ill when I defended him (all I did was say that it shouldn’t matter what section he gets his clothes from). This past year I have been so scared that we’ll find him dead one day. He always jokes about suicide and he’s told me that he wants to give himself top surgery and doesn’t care if he bleeds out. He’s that desperate for a flat chest. Every time he does so much as wear multiple sports bras, the yelling will start again.  
That is literally abuse and your father should be heavily punished for that.

Please!! Make some connections to resources in your community!! The Bible preaches way more about loving your neighbor and not judging than it does about anything regarding sexuality or gender!! Please please please make connections with someone who can help you!!! Your parents need to learn that they don't have to choose between loving their religion and loving and supporting  you and your siblings!!!

Pretty sure the Bible says it's not up to you to decide if someone goes to Hell or not, and preaches forgiveness and such. No clue why people do the exact opposite.

Well there's contradictory statements in the bible. Different churches follow different parts and ignore/make excuses for the others

The Bible never mentions Hell at all, the whole concept was introduced about 300 years after Christ died.  The Bible never mentions heaven either—there is no afterlife in the Bible--Old Testament or New. In Revelations we learn that the dead get brought back to life on judgement day and good people stay on earth which is replaced by a descending “heavenly Jerusalem” while the bad people get tossed into a lake of fire— literally a lake of fire, this is not a metaphor for some sort of plane of eternal torture.

If we tried to prove god exists through a criminal trial style process, it would be acquitted cause of lack of evidence.

Can you talk about your and your brothers' processes of self-discovery?  
Can you talk about your and your brothers' processes of self-discovery?  
I don’t really know about my brothers. All I know is that my older brother was in college and my little brother was about 15 when they realized. For me, there were a lot of points in my life where I knew I was trans, but didn’t accept it or thought “not yet.” I realized I liked girls at 15. I realized I only liked girls at 18. The girl I was dating at the time referred to me as a woman and I cried myself to sleep so I figured something was up but I didn’t really know. Not long after that, I saw that one of my favorite youtubers came out as a trans guy (well first he came out as nonbinary and then a few months later came out as ftm). I related to every single thing he said so I started questioning my gender. Meanwhile I was trying to become more visible as a lesbian so I started wearing snapbacks. Whenever I didn’t wear a snapback a guy would flirt with me and I hated it so I made the decision to cut my hair so I would still be visible even if I didn’t feel like wearing a hat that day. By that point I was like 60% sure I was trans, but not 100%. I luckily pass very well with short hair so people immediately started calling me he and I absolutely loved it. Someone on Reddit also told me what the diagnosis criteria of gender dysphoria was because I said something like “I want to be a man, but that doesn’t make a trans because I don’t have dysphoria.” That’s when I was 100% sure.  That was probably very jumbled and didn’t make sense. Sorry about that.

I’m not out to the rest of my family. I don’t talk to them very often so it just hasn’t come up yet (I haven’t really started transitioning yet so I don’t really need to yet). Most of them are supportive of the LGBT community so I’m assuming they will be once I tell them.

He’s 17.  I want to move out soon. The issue with that is that I don’t have a job. I’m working on getting my mental health to a state where a job is actually feasible for me. Living in this kind of environment is not kind to my brain.  
Get outta there was soon as possible cuz staying will never fix your mentality. My sister has sever depression and only after moving away to live alone as she actually been able to progress. My parents were the issue and yours are too. But bring your younger brother with you too. It’s unsafe for him.

I’m curious to see if there’s a genetic aspect to it since 3/3 kids are either gay or transgender. Do you have any relatives you know of (like aunts or uncles or cousins) that are gay and could your dad be closeted?

Well it’s actually 3/5. We also have two other older siblings. No one in our extended family is out. It’s possible that some people are closeted though. One of my uncles has never had a long term girlfriend (I’m pretty sure the longest one lasted two months). My little brother seems to think pretty much everyone is a closeted bisexual though.

Sexuality is a mix of genetic, hormonal and prenatal factors, and there's still much discussion on the topic. The overall consensus is that there isn't one main factor.  Being transgender is considered to be mainly dependent on development in the womb, but not because of the womb environment itself. Transwomen for example are trans mainly because androgen receptors etc in the brain don't work like they were supposed to, kind of just by accident, because humans are complicated and things sometimes don't work as intended (not all the 'cogs and gears function properly). This is in no way to say trans people are 'broken' or anything of the sort, but what it does mean is that it helps explain why their gender identity differs from their physical body.  The brain essentially has a blueprint that's telling it how the body is going to be built, but then something goes wrong on the bodys end, and when the brain looks around it's like, 'the fuck is this nonsense???' and that's gender dysphoria, when the brain's idea of what it should be is different from what's actually there, leading to a desire to have your body look 'different,'  in order to make it match what the brain is constantly telling you it should be. You can see how that'd be upsetting. =/

It is definitely genetic or has a genetic component. I have a friend that has 7 siblings. All but 1 boy and 1 girl are gay. Of course they have a super religious family but they are the accepting kind!

I mean this with no disrespect, but if someone is trasgendered AND gay, does that mean they're originally straight (mtf who's into girls, ftm who's into guys) or like, straight but in reverse (mtf who's into males, ftm who's into females)? how is that handled that from their perspective? also, are there any profound stigmas that you've noticed now that you've come out? i have two transgendered friends, one of which is very androgenous and could pass for either gender, and one who is quite obviously... well, very tall and muscular with a beard, but identifies as a woman. so i sometimes wonder what every day life must be like for them. i've always been curious how generally people who are transgendered are treated in public or by strangers you see in day to day life, but frankly i've been too much of a chickenshit to bring it up personally with my friends. i would imagine it's easier if the person sort of looks the part yeah? like if you're a rather girly looking man who identifies as a female it's easier for strangers to accept that compared to someone with facial hair. of course, most people would try to be civil about it or just give that stilted "okay" but i find you can see it in their eyes if they're just humoring you or being polite for the sake of it, and that has to weigh on the soul a little bit - that doesn't even cover outright bigots or people who just "don't get it." like take for example, you're at a concert or a show and you're invited on stage to be part of the act, whether its a performance piece, a comedy set, or a concert. and the host introduces you as "this fine young gentleman/lady" - do you correct them, or do you just let it slide? because if you accept and are fine with being misgendered, fine, but if you're not, and you correct them, you take the risk of their reaction and the crowd's reaction if you don't entirely look the part. i'm quite socially anxious so that kind of deliberation would probably kill me. i imagine you'd just need to have a really good set of humor about it, but i'd like to hear how you would handle something like that.

People who are attracted to the same gender as themselves are considered gay. If I’m in a situation where everyone thinks I’m a girl, I’ll say that I’m gay, but if I’m in a situation where I’m out or people think I’m male I’ll say that I’m straight. On Reddit, sometimes I’ll say “I’m a straight guy” other times I’ll just say “I’m attracted to the same sex” and other times “I’m attracted to the opposite gender” depending on the context. The worst that I’ve gotten is judgmental stares when I need to go into the women’s restroom or changing room for whatever reason. Luckily, I pass pretty well. I told people in my dance class that I don’t have preferred pronouns because I didn’t want to come out yet, but I also didn’t want to tell them to call me she. I told one of my friends in that class that I prefer he/him, but that’s it. I noticed that as soon as it got too hot in the room and I took off my shirt and only wore a sports bra, my friend started calling me they and other people only called me she. I will never correct somebody if I’m misgendered. I will only correct somebody if I’m in a public restroom with someone I know and someone confronts me.

Since these are all more general questions, you'd probably be better off taking them to /r/asktransgender. Better sample size there than just one. Folks there are generally pretty welcoming so long as you're not outright bigoted, and you seem more like someone who genuinely just wants to learn.

i try to speak cautiously as i am from a fairly conservative background. my early behavior was shaped by people who do not take kindly to all of this new gender identity stuff. but to be honest, some of the most down to earth, relaxed, fun to be around people i've ever met have been... differently oriented, to say.  so i do still have a great many questions and confusions but i often hold my tongue, save my curt lexicon be construed for insensitivity.

I would definitely second that recommendation of r/transgender. As long as you're polite, which you seem to be, and are not trying to convince everyone that trans people are mentally ill (since they're not) then I definitely encourage you to ask questions. I'm also willing to answer any questions you have as well, as my close friend is trans. =)

>   do you correct them, or do you just let it slide?  I'm not OP, but I am a trans person with a LOT of public speaking/on-stage experience (both for my job and for fun, I live in a very "showy" place.) The exact situations you described have happened to me before where someone has called me by one gender and I've had to correct them in a very public way. I just politely shout back something like "I'm a dude, dude!" and we have a mild laugh about it and continue on. Usually they'll say something like "Whoops sorry, you're a very pretty man!" and move on, but there is always the risk. Not so much that the host will be rude or mean about it, but that broadcasting that you're 'different' to a crowd can certainly put a person on edge.

If it’s creating such a toxic and abusive environment for your brother who’s a minor, I could highly consider getting CPS involved for his wellbeing and maybe they can even help you. I’m not well versed in the services they offer but please check into it because your parents aren’t helping you and your brother whatsoever. Hope it all gets better.

My dad has already been investigated for child abuse. That was back when we were getting physically abused as well and they didn’t do anything. Now he’s only emotionally abusing us and that’s almost impossible to prove.

Have you started transitioning? Are you AMAB or AFAB or genderfluid or nonbinary? When did you decide you were trans? (This one is a joke but i get it like every time i meet someone in the south XD)

Somewhat. I have a masculine haircut, in some of my classes I’ve changed my name, and I’ve told some of my friends to call me by a different name and use he/him pronouns, but that’s it. I’m AFAB.  I consider myself somewhat nonbinary, but mostly male. It’s hard to explain and it’s very confusing even to me. It’s easier to just say I’m a trans man.

I have having a hard time with the math.  You and your brother are transgender. That means you have vaginas but are men?  He is gay. That means he has a vagina and enjoys people who have or think they should have penises?  Excuse my obtuseness but I am having a hard time keeping up.

My younger brother is trans and panromantic (romantically attracted to all genders). My older brother is cis and gay. If it was my younger brother who was the gay one, you’d be correct

I'm so sorry :( My cousins are in a similar situation, both MTF. My very Catholic Aunt is having the worst time accepting it (her "perfect Canadian life has been ruined; she immigrated from the Philipines.) My Uncle doesn't really say much about it, but is really uncomfortable whenever it's brought up.  Funny enough, I'm gay. As is another cousin of ours. I was the first to come out (perks of being the oldest) and my aunt would try to work her way around the subject every time it was mentioned to her.  Either way, my family invited them up for their first ever Pride last year, and they both had a blast despite the torrential downpour. We hung out with our other gay cousin, his brother and my sister. It was fantastic.

I’m new to posting on reddit but I include the “lmao’s” to ensure that you know I’m laughing at you, rather than taking you and your self-imposed victimhood seriously. Try getting a life rather than attacking those you disagree with. I won’t obsess and check your post history like you did for me lmao, but surely you’ve got a busy weekend of internet ranting to get back to.

On the one hand she's being deceitful. On the other hand, she's working the gig economy and legitimately delivering product for paid services.

Essentially she took advantage of people’s natural biases.  
What does that even mean? It is a lot of words that don't add up to a claim--she literally does the work she advertises, just under different identities, which are all the same level of unreal--and aren't necessarily more unreal than her normative identity. So what are these "natural biases"?

What’s confusing about it? This woman can clearly do web design, comics, etc.  Employer that may think that women can’t do comics as well as men. So she is working under the Tom pen name. And they accept the comics because there’s no potential bias against female comics writers (conscious or sub conscious). Same scenario as above with Web design, here comes Frank. If they like the work it shouldn’t matter if it’s a man or woman. But not every employer can be, mentally, completely neutral that way. Different scenario, Employer thinks “oh this person is so cultured, they’re from London they may have traveled so much around Europe eating such sophisticated food”. “Eva” may know the exact same amount as the person writing but because “Eva” has all these potential connotations that people may put on her, she’s going to be the food reviewer that foodies may choose. If after these examples you don’t understand what I’m talking about, can I suggest you read the book “Blind Spot”? It’s by a Harvard professor that explains all of the blind spots people tend to have that they don’t realize or are so sub consciously acted on that they don’t realize that they have any biases.

If people knew she was anti Puttin they might not buy from her or follow her. Or they may not enjoy comic books and not follow her. It's as simple as that. We act on natural biases on a daily basis.  
Still not sure how these fake personas make you money? Do you run a webdesign company and these fake people applied to your real company? or are these fake personas also webdesigners and you just do their work?  
This is fake. "I'm the boss at.." nobody talks like that who's an actual manager or owner of a company.

How do you get paid for Frank's work? don't the customers see the name when sending the money? Can you tell me more about dropshipping? It's a very interesting idea, but how do you get someone to manage the inventory? Is this legal? Just curious here. Thanks! ​

PayPal possibly or other payment services. You don't have to have your name as the account. I've sent plenty of payments for goods and services through PayPal without seeing the owner's name.

Do you ever make mistakes changing between personas from different countries? British people can speak quite differently from Americans for instance. You said the London persona gets sent free food, but don't you need to get this sent to a country different to where you're claiming to be from?

Yeah little discrepancies like this make me question the legitimacy of the entire thing. OP still didn't detail how these accounts really make money anyway.

They all presumably are home businesses.  My question is how the income is registered for OP, because income from each one of the fake persona's businesses could add up to tax fraud i think. Unless she just counts it as unspecified income on her real identity.

when doing freelance work couldnt she just send out invoices and have those "companies" pick up the money, then have herself as the owner and take the payout at the end of year? That way Tom or Frank or whoever are doing the work, but the company they work for is taking the pay. Then the owner of the company just takes full salary from the company? Does that make sense?

I felt the same way. When she said her first profile lives and owns a comic bookstore in philly, but she works and lives in London. I remember a few being part of a few Philly based forum a few years back, some foreign scammers would try and sell some lie about them being a store owner who can help people out (e.g. car parts, head shop, anything else). They would get questioned then, immediately get called out from not knowing shit (geography of the place he said his shop is located, vernacular etc) and (quoting here) talking “too much like a faggot”.

I admire your creativity and time management skills. Personally, I think you should tell your boyfriend sooner than later especially if he is the one. So many people have fake personas on social media these days, that it’s not so uncommon.

This is the most worrying part of the thread. You're picking up on her personality? SHE'S NOT REAL! It's you! It's your personality!  It sounds like you're wasting a lot of time on these. You say they bring in money but you're the boss of a company? If your web design 'personailty' brings in 30% of your income, why don't you invest that energy in sales for your actual real business?  I also find it worrying that you're deceiving people in saying you're earning a PHD and talking about politics in a completely different country, when you have none of the qualifications to back it up. It's dangerous territory and I'd be very surprised if you're not spreading false information to people who listen. Just because you can speak the language, doesn't mean you know as much as a master's student!!

It's a hobby. Is that time wasted?  
Not really time wasted and hopefully no one is getting hurt but it does sound awfully unhealthy when it gets to the point you think youre picking up personality traits of people youve made up. I dunno, maybe that's normal for authors and stuff and OP is fine but it sounds concerning   
It's a hobby. Is that time wasted?  
She said she does it at work, so I'd say it's distracting her from growing her real bysuness. Saying that the personalities earn 5-30% of income isn't really a lot of justification when you have a business that could legitimately earn more. If I were an employee of the web design company I'd be pretty annoyed my boss has been pretending to be a developer in the US instead of getting work for our business!  
It's a hobby. Is that time wasted?  
You can't just say 'it's a hobby' and suddenly the activity becomes harmless. Drinking heavily is 'just a hobby'.  Snorting coke off a bathroom counter is 'just a hobby'. So .. is that time wasted?  Depends on the activity, not whether it is her 'hobby'.

Aren't you just losing who you are as a person and spending more time dedicated to fake personas than you do to your own life? Why not do all these things under your own name? Sounds like some deep rooted confidence issues that I see time and again on that catfish show.

Authors write books for money. A modern online freelancer/entrepreneur writes blogs, takes photos, shoots videos, writes code etc for money. It's not that distant IMO. Words tend to be applied in new areas even when the things are only vaguely similar.  For instance, birds and aeroplanes have "wings", even when they are not very similar at all. However, they both provide lift, and that's close enough for us to use the same word for them.

Yeah but she's probably using other people's pictures to do this. I doubt she's using stock images for all these personas. I mean it's not that unethical, but I wouldn't want someone essentially impersonating me with my pictures.

I doubt she actually posts pictures of these personas online. It's perfectly conceivable to have an Instagram without pictures of yourself, especially if it's food focused, as well as a Facebook or Twitter account without an actual profile picture, the rest aren't really personality focused.

Have you read her comments? She has a split personality disorder, she can’t even control when and what personality she becomes. This is absolutely nothing like a pen name, I’m feeling very concerned that people are so casually feeding into a severe mental illness.  This person could very easily hurt her/himself or those around them with this type of behaviour.

I would just find it funny if someone I was with for three years suddenly came to me with all this. You should tell him.  My friends and I did this sort of thing back in high school and we got pretty good at it. I don't think I would have been able to go at it alone like you do though.

Sounds like a desperate reach for attention, between the fake accounts to the post here without even answering anything. I think it’s a cry for attention and help, especially since you are using other people’s pictures as profile pictures and creating “relationships” on these accounts.

Have you ever sought counseling, or explored the ethics of what you're doing with a professional? I don't ask this to be catty or judgmental, but you stated that you regard your behaviour as "sick," and I wonder at how this play out if you choose a life-long relationship with another person.  You share a home, and one day they begin to wonder why you're getting all these gifts.   ​

if I was your boyfriend that was serious and found out about this I would be pissed and probably leave you. This is something that only time will make it worst, if you wanna do your thing thats cool but when you try to hide it to someone you care about thats when it becomes a giant red flag. Best of luck to you and hope it all works out. Also I would check into laws, I dont know anything about the UK but it wouldn't surprise me if something about this fiasco is considered a felony/felonys

This seems more something some teenager or sociopath would dream his/hers life would be like. It sounds too much like a movie. But really i'm sure 90% of this story is made up. Because how some parts of the story is very detailed and some very vague, that happens with  a lot of made up stories. There is a big difference if you describe something real or something you are making up in your mind.  And also you seem like a good writer, so possibly with a good imagination. But that might also be evidence, that you really could handle all that what you wrote. But i still call it bs.

Do you know the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa? He did the same you do in the beginning of the 20th century but with literature. His heteronyms wrote in completely different literary styles, interacted with each other through letters and have great discussions. Look into it, it’s great.

If they are using anything but stock images for these personas, it's a little creepy to essentially impersonate someone. Unless these Instagram accounts make posts daily with no face attached, yet manage to have a big following.  I can see each of these profiles getting a following without pictures given their "interests", but I doubt it. Until op responds to one of the many questions in this thread about pictures.

Well she is still deceiving people. If it’s even true, which I doubt

I wouldn’t be happy to know I bought services from a fake persona... and I don’t think there’s a single person that would be “wow, that’s so cool, I wish more people used fake personas on the internet”... in the best scenario they wouldn’t care, but I believe most people wouldn’t appreciate this behaviour if they were directly involved.. hence it’s kinda immoral.. there’s always the chance someone discover this

So... you do all of your work from behind 4 different social media accounts that you update often? What benefit do you get from working behind the profiles of four different people?   when most of them bring a good chunk of money  Wouldn't you make more money if you spent the time "updating profiles" on "just doing work" (beyond your early ploy to drum up business)? I don't understand how this helps you make more money than if you just spent your time working.

Is this correlated to any kind of mental disturbance such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? I’m asking because this kinda sounds like a poet we had who wrote under different names, but the whole life behind each name was entirely different from his own.

As someone who is clueless when it comes to social media, any big tips to getting a lot of followers and likes and all that bullshit? I just have Reddit and Facebook (which I haven't posted anything on in like 2 years.) I don't post anything about my life. I feel my life is too boring, but I've come to the realization that I need to start using social media in order to not look like such a weirdo in today's society. I've actually thought about making accounts for myself for my social media, but trying to keep my name off of social media, if that makes sense. I'm just paranoid I'll one day try to get a decent job and I want because someone is going to see a potentially distasteful post, or maybe a picture of me in a more compromising state and not hire me.

Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

I immediately proceeded to laugh and pace around my kitchen because I didn't know whether to log on here or not! hahah   I honestly don't know if I've been offered anything like that, I would think not because I don't deserve it just because of this lol. I still haven't gotten through my messages though!   I don't know about any restrictions actually.   :P  Oooh ffs, a jackdaw is a crow.   
Normally an account downvoted to the negatives would receive restrictions. That admins said they would try to waive that for you, considering the circumstances. Seems like they came through.

 I've already gotten three years worth, give it to other random users or charity or something!  Unidan had 16. I'm sure those downvoting shitheads can cough up some more.

Yea it was retarded. It's 16 years and 8 months or something last time I checked. So if you decided to postpone this AMA and just exclusively read through all the messages and PMs you got, how long do you think you'd need?

You're taking this incredibly well and it's easy to see you're taking a very balanced approach to this. As someone who, once or twice, became a lightning rod for something in their life... If it ever seems to start feeling negative, please remember this. A million people doing the wrong thing doesn't make it right. It just makes it popular. Thanks for sharing.

OH That makes a bit more sense then. I honestly didn't report him or anything!   
That was what led to the brigading. But what actually happened was /u/unidan was logging into alts to downvote you.  The reddit admins caught on and the rest is history..

Just to point out that is entirely not what actually happened, rather what people from that AA thread thought happened. Unidan's ban had nothing to do with you anyway, he broke reddit rules by vote-cheating, and admitted to have been doing this for more than a year, so definitely before the argument started.

Hi Ecka6! I'm really happy to see you active again. After I saw what some Redditors did with your account I was really putting this place into question, because you were arguing reasonable, polite, and patient - and that can't be valued enough. So the reaction from the mob was quite shocking for me. So, did some mods give you the idea for this AMA? I sincerely hope ( and suppose ) that you'll have tons of karma by the end of the day, you truly deserve it for not backing down. Way to go! Thanks!

How does it feel when you make the most liked man on reddit into the most hated man on reddit? People telling that he seems to be a nice guy - well maybe - but I'll be wary, what he was caught doing might just be scratching the surface. It shows a lot about his character, especially when he is a grown man with so much popularity.

There was talk over in /r/subredditdrama that you may have been scared away from reddit due to the shitstorm and brigading.  I'm glad to see that you're taking it all in stride.   And I also noticed that you're back into positive karma.  did the admins reset your karma (if they can do that) or is it just a bunch of nice redditors giving karma charity?

Hi! I've read the original argument as it was happening and totally stood on your side. (I still have you tagged as crow fighter.) I understand that Unidan was probably right, but he was unable to explain his point well. He behaved like a total jerk, which came as surprise to me as he is usually really nice. I like him for years and RES shows that I gave him [+26] points overall. Then came the Uniban and you took a huge karma beating from his circlejerk. I was sorry and embarassed to see that. I've seen cupcake make a promise to make sure your usability of the site won't be hindered – what happened after that? Did she restore your karma afterall, or? I seriously hope you won't be doxxed and harrased over this anymore. People have been known to get death threats over thing they said on reddit. Anyway, there's no harm in buying you gold as all the money go toward maintaining this site (and 10% to charities we pick, IIRC), so why not show our support that way? I don't regret it. :) Lastly: What have you been doing with that Slovak flag on your cheek? Have you visited my country? :) Good luck and don't give up on reddit!

The first time I saw her smelling my chair. When she heard me coming she said that she dropped a quarter and it rolled under my desk. I never saw any coins.  The second time I walked over to the director's office and I saw her from the glass partition smelling a pencil I was wearing behind my ear. She doesn't know I saw her. It didn't smell like anything to me. Periodically I feel my trash has been dug through but I haven't actually seen her do it.

This is just a little bit creepy. You should touch and use a lot of stuff around her and then covertly document these events for potential legal use later, but mostly for posting for our amusement.

It didn't smell like anything to me. Periodically I feel my trash has been dug through but I haven't actually seen her do it.  
You should blatantly display on your desk several items that would be too good to pass up

wtf?? this is clearly obsessive stalker levels of behaviour. document and talk to HR, this is how you get a knife put at your throat at 3am in your bed, because she decided to break in to make sure you truly love her. or you're a troll which seems a bit more likely at this point

What kind of job is this were outwardly weird people working there, has become normal? Also you should bring some strongly scented Clorox wipes to work and wipe down everything in your cubicle, and whenever you use something, before you put it back/throw away, wipe it down just to see what she does or how she responds. It would be so awesome if she watched you, while a single tear of total devastation rolled down her cheek.

 What kind of job is this were outwardly weird people working there, has become normal?   I work corporate for an international company so there are a lot of different kinds of people in and out here. We also do a lot of government work so... there's that. It's kind of a mix of high paid CFO types all the way down to temp workers out of rehab doing cold-calls. She works as an administrative assistant.  Also you should bring some strongly scented Clorox wipes to work and wipe down everything in your cubicle  Actually this is a better idea than leaving the gross drink cups around. I'm actually going to do this tomorrow. Man I don't know why but until this comment I wasn't really grossed out. I kind of don't want to touch my mouse now. ...and I just saw her walk across the hall so I guess I better get hyped to talk to her soon...  
Just posted a small update. I wouldn't say she was flirting with me but she was a bit too happy that I agreed to talk tomorrow. FML.  
You know you gotta update this tomorrow now right?

Also wipe it down directly after she touches anything, even if it's in front of her, so she knows quite clearly that you're not interested in being in contact with her DNA, either. If she asks, you can just claim to be a germ freak.

I would love this as well, but the idea of her no longer being able to smell in search of his specific scent makes me laugh, because what she is doing is so bizarre. But yes he should definitely clean things right in front of her, while also making serious eye contact

She's very obviously enamored with you. Weird as hell, but drawn to you, none-the-less. Face it, brah. You make her liver quiver.

0% of what she's doing is ok. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking Get in contact with HR as soon as possible. Get this woman as far away from you as possible.  Now again, I'm a big fat ass I am not physically afraid of this 110lb person.  If you think she might attack you, you should be worried regardless of her size or strength. It doesn't take much strength to shoot or stab you. Tell your SO about the stalker immediately. Imagine your SO gets a call from stalker saying that you two had sex, and now potentially your relationship is falling apart. It's also important that you don't talk to her, because that could only encourage her.

This woman licked your leftover slobber from a cup that was put in the trash. I don't think you are fully appreciating the level of crazy that is Cuppy. Let me break it down for ya.. She has moved on from fantasizing about marrying you to full on planning it. She's got the colors picked out and the couples first dance song on repeat while dancing with a mop. There may even be a picture of your face (or Bruce Willis') stapled to it.. I also wouldn't be surprised if she snapped a picture of you and went on one of those 'what's my baby gonna look like' web sites, printed out a boy and girl and framed them where they now sit on her night stand next to your photoshopped wedding pictures.  What she sees in your body language right now (from what you've said) is shyness and potential. You've brushed off her advances so far but she is determined and crazy and that is a bad combo my friend. You gotta shut this shit down man.

Put something in the cup that would be gross/unpleasant to lick but not harmful to her.  And get up from your desk again and see what happens.       And then report back what happens.      Have you considered the possibility that she likes you and just has a weird fetish about you?    Or maybe she's trying to collect your DNA to make a clone of you.

Most people hate that but TBH the way she is acting right now I don't think she wants to come near my desk for awhile.   Have you considered the possibility that she likes you and just has a weird fetish about you?  Maybe but I'm a huge neckbeard and married so I can't imagine the attraction.  Or maybe she's trying to collect your DNA to make a clone of you.  This is the most likely explanation.

you need to talk with the intern because it seems like you're the only real people in the building. Get him to report any bizarre things she does to you. Not just for the sake of our entertainment, but to look out for the kid too.

Okay, a few things for Boris: Congrats on the raise dude! Although I think maybe cup licker brought up your name to the CFO because she wanted to work with you more. I really think that she is just playing a game maybe. She's probably a little bit attracted to you but with the winking and leaving more notes...I think she wants to freak you out. My theory is she's bored at work and wants to mess with someone. Not exactly mature but whatever. You should tell HR, or even the CFO, that you don't feel comfortable working near her. She touches your stuff, leaves odd notes, and winks at you, and then even licked a cup you had drunk from. That's more than enough grounds.

If it were just winking and maybe notes, I might agree with the game theory, that she's just messing with him. But licking a cup from the trash and smelling his chair? Nah, that's creepy stalker right there.  Also, the dressing up and makeup today...my bet is on crazy, inappropriate crush. Inappropriate office behaviour either way, though. Glad OP went to HR.

Yeah that part I never understand. This kind of happened before which is what I was afraid of, but not to me personally. We had this sales guy that worked here that was a total douche bag. Talked down to everyone like they were shit to him. Got on everyones nerves from the plant to lower management. Tons of people reported him and they never did anything. My only guess is that it's not causing a real 'workplace disruption' so why acknowledge it? Plus they fire the guy and now they have to pay him unemployment. I think HR just rather wash their hands of it really.

She has a crush on you. It's kinda obvious from everything you've said. You also said in the comments that you don't think that's the case because of how you look. Which is bizarre. You don't see fat dudes out on the streets with girlfriends? People are attracted to a lot of varied things. So, yeah, she likes you. It doesn't sound like she wants to kill you.

She's probably harmless, but are you all afraid or feeling anxious as a result of this situation? Does she lick the cups of other coworkers?  Did you tell your wife? What did she say?

Oh I don't think I could narrow it down that low. There are so many amazing personal stories I read on in internet about people who make sacrifice like I'll never know. Pretty much anyone who is dealt a bad hand and still manages to go on living, and anyone who has born to great fortune and uses it to better others would make my list.      I guess if I had to list specifics I could only name my grandmothers. One lost everything due to a dictator and still managed to get to the US and make a life for herself. The other lived a quiet life at home to raise 9 kids, outlived all her friends and still died surrounded by people who cared for her.     If that's not manly enough just forget what I said and go with Macho Man Randy Savage 5 times.

There's a small amount of people around who think it's a wise idea to adopt wild animals - usually wolves, or big cats.  From experience, which wild animal (that's a common enough purchase by exotic pet owners) is the absolute dumbest to bring into your home? I once met one woman who had a wolf. The poor guy was on a muzzle all day, because he just ate all the furniture whenever he was set free. I'm guessing there was just no possible way for her to exercise the wolf enough to not constantly be pent up with energy.

What do you think of the more recently noticed practice (to me at least) of adopting raccoons, and foxes and keeping them as house pets? The videos of these little creatures always excites me and makes me think "I need a raccoon!" but in reality I'm sure I'd rather not have one as pet.

Not OP but I was a zookeeper for 3 years who worked with both of those, and I wouldn't want either as a pet. I'm going to be generalizing here of course; obviously every individual animal is different. Don't get me wrong, I love foxes and reds are my favorite animal, but they're incredibly smelly, hyperactive, insanely curious/intelligent and require lots of mental stimulation, will chew up furniture, dig up plants, dig up holes all over the yard, don't always handle being leashed well, require a specialized diet (as in you can't just feed them dog food and be done with it) etc. As far as exotics go they're not too bad but they're absolutely not going to be a pet in the same way a dog or cat would.  Raccoons are also extremely messy (I can't stress this one enough), can get into things they're not supposed to get into (drawers, locks, latches, ice chests, etc), are prone to biting, and are illegal in many cases. In a worst case scenario if your raccoon bites someone they may have to be euthanized to determine if they have rabies, even if they were vaccinated for it. They also don't do well in small spaces for more than short periods of time so if you have to crate it you potentially end up with a super pissed raccoon. In both cases it's going to be hard/expensive to find a vet who will treat them, they're illegal in some places, and both require specialized diets. They're cute, but they do much better in the wild than as pets.

Yeah, I had looked into it after finding a facebook operated by a guy who has a red fox, seeing his videos sparked my interest so much but from the videos you could also see how destructive Loki (the fox) could be and the attention he wants/requires.  I wouldn't ever adopt an exotic pet, my current lifestyle (possibility of having to move every few years and having to find a cat watcher for trips to see family) just isn't the right fit to give them everything that deserve.

That's a really bad idea. While raccoons do look cute their behavior is anything but. As a rule of thumb they're hard to train, are unpredictable and have bad temper. And they bite. A lot. Not to mention that they're really smart. While it sounds like a good thing, the sad reality is that it means they require constant attention and if they get none they grow bored very fast. And when this happens they do go and entertain themselves however they can thoroughly trashing the place in the process. Bottom line: it's like having a feral 3-year old running around.

My friends dad found a baby raccoon as a teen and kept him for about 6 years, until there was an unfortunate accident where some guests were backing out of the driveway, and ran over him. He said he was just like a cat and would hang around the house during the day and come in at night. He liked to ride around on his shoulders. The dad had a summer job at a nearby water park for a few years, and would bring him after hours sometimes, and as it turns out, that raccoon really liked going down the water slide.

That's a tough question to answer. There are so many aspects to the work that what you may love one day, you'll hate the next. I guess seeing little kids get really excited about seeing their favorite animals is what I like the most. Entitled people thinking that their admission ticket allows them to do "whatever the fuck I want to" make me think I'll be on the evening news at some point.

That's a tough question to answer. There are so many aspects to the work that what you may love one day, you'll hate the next. I guess seeing little kids get really excited about seeing their favorite animals is what I like the most. Entitled people thinking that their admission ticket allows them to do "whatever the fuck I want to" make me think I'll be on the evening news at some point.  
It sucks, but the truth is a crappy 10% of zoo goers (retail customers, etc..) can totally overrule the polite 90%.

I find this to be true at any service-based business. If you're reading this and you're an asshole to your waitress because you don't like your food, or you're yelling at a gate agent because of a fee that you have to pay for your baggage being too heavy...remember that it's not their fault. I've found that I am MUCH more likely to get what I want (and things beyond that like upgrades, free items, special treatment, etc.) if I am nice. And having worked in service before, I will go out of my way to reward people who are nice to me, and anyone who yells at me for something beyond my control or treats me like I'm beneath them gets the terrible service that they deserve.

I've been doing this long enough that I've seen a lot of weird behavior, so I don't know how to answer that. I'll think about it and come back. Dangerous situations are the norm when working with animals and quickly become "just another day" events. The closest I've ever come to mortal injury was when a rhino bull broke out of his crate during a shipment.

My girlfriend doesn't want to visit zoos because she thinks it's cruel to keep wild animals in cages only so humans can view them. I argued that some of these animals are there because they would not have a chance of survival in the wild (birth defect, irresponsible previous owner, etc.), but it's clearly not the case for every single one of them. What's your take on this?

The animals we have in zoos and similar institutions were captive bred (a few exceptions). They would not exist at all were they not "in cages". These animals are their ambassadors to the human world. They are the examples that let us know just how precious the wild population is. Cruel is to let these animals starve to death as their habitat is slowly chewed up by industrialized entities. Cruel is to forget how incredible they are. Cruel is to lose focus on the big picture and let a species evaporate in the wild with no chance of being revived.

I logged in just to thank you for this answer.   Sometimes I get sad when I think about the animals being "in cages."   I'll remember your comment every time those thoughts creep in now.

This is exactly what I try to explain to people about zoo animals. I gained so much love and respect for wildlife because my mother took me to the zoo every month. I truly believe that is the reason.

There are species that would no longer exist without zoos.   My local zoo saved a species back in the 60's which has been successfully re-introduced in the wild.

Did you absolutely love playing Zoo Tycoon?  
Did you absolutely love playing Zoo Tycoon?  
I play it, but it annoys the shit out of me.  
It's something we train for and pray to never use.  
You probably don't actually know this, but was the trainer who had to take that shot someone who interacted with Harambe on a regular basis? I guess the better question is - If something like this situation happened at any zoo, who actually gets chosen to have to take that shot? Is it the closest trainer? Are there only a couple trainers that are qualified to do it? Do they make sure and try to get a trainer from a different area of the zoo? I can imagine it would be an unbelievably difficult thing to do if you interacted with that animal on a day to day basis and had a close relationship with it.   
This is a point I've tried to make to friends when they make Harambe jokes/link memes. Imagine something like your dog bit someone, through no real fault of their own, but had to be put down. Then people make fun of it to no end. That'd be soul crushing, for me at least.  
Damn. This puts it in a new light for me, I never thought of it that way. We had to put down my dog in that same scenario about a year ago. Dicks are no longer out.   
I kinda expected this question. All AZA accredited zoos are required to have what is called a "shoot protocol". This delineates when lethal force is allowed and when it is required. Any time a visitor's life is in danger (this is a gross oversimplification) the animal will be shot. If Harambe and the boy were not in the water, the outcome could have been different. The water factor raised the stakes exponentially. I can almost guarantee the staff member that had to take that shot has undergone/is undergoing grief counseling. That is an action no zoo professional looks forward to.

The zoo I volunteered at a few years ago had Asian Elephants. One winter night, one of their keepers forgot to lock the barn door to the outside. On of the elephants got out and just decided to stay out there (she could have easily reentered the barn), and got hypothermia from the snow. The elephant eventually recovered fully. This was about 2 years ago, and I'm told that keeper is still in counseling over this one mistake.

It kinda racks my brain to think that some people were expecting a different outcome. I'm certainly sorry that an animal had to lose life, but do people think that they (the zoo... an entity with a reputation and customer base to maintain) were going to risk letting that little boy (potentially) die a (potentially) painful death in front of everyone watching? It sucks for everyone involved that an animal had to be hurt let alone killed, but it baffles me that some people can imagine the zoo letting this go any different way. On the internet, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.

Where does all the poop go?   
Where does all the poop go?   
Not OP but a zookeeper nonetheless! I'm sure that different facilities might handle their poo situation differently, but in my experience all old substrate, uneaten food, branches, poo, etc. get dumped somewhere on the acres of land the zoo owns that's outside the actually zoo grounds. Herbivore poop can go in the pile with all the other compostables, like food scraps, old straw, leaves, and the like. Some zoos actually sell their compost for gardening which is super neat! The other poo that doesn't end up in the general compost pile either goes in a separate pile, with all the other biodegradable materials that don't make good compost, or into a septic tank. The smells that come from said septic tank will haunt your dreams....

I go to sleep every night trying to figure this out. Until the mis-information is squashed, the demand will be there. My personal take is that all poachers are summarily executed at the time of their arrest.

I'm not sure if you heard of a 3D printer that is able to print extremely pure rhino horns? They want to flood the market with extremely low prices, to fight against poaching.   This article does provide great explanations why it's not the solution. The fact that people need to learn the facts and myths about rhino horns need to be addressed to reduce the demand. Because the demand for rhino horns is still growing. While I think it's great that technology is trying to help, I'm certain you stand on the same side and believe that we must educate the people instead.  Could you perhaps bust a couple of myths about rhino (or other animals) horns? That aren't as easily or correctly answered on the web?

I can't image any predator would respond well to that.. My guess would be that to them, you're bleeding and if you're bleeding to them that would translate to injured. And if you're injured you are weak therefore prey.

My little brother has Down syndrome and when he was little, I used to take him to the zoo quite a bit (I'm 14 years older than him and this has kind of always been our thing). EVERY time we've been, I've noticed certain animals  will come to the window or closer to the viewing area almost as if they are communicating with him. This includes a gorgeous white tiger that stretched its body on the glass and pawed at us for a very long time. My question is: Based on your education and firsthand experience with animals, do you think they have a special sense about these things?? I've always wondered if I've made the whole thing up and would love a processional's take on it.

We, as humans, have decided that the only way to communicate is how we do. This is hubris. Animals interact on an instinctual level that we don't get. It could be that the tiger was seeing something in your brother that we wouldn't. Please take this next statement with a grain of salt; predators also see weakness. I don't know you or your brother, but the tiger seems to. Examine exactly what it is that he does when he sees your brother. He may not be as friendly as you hope. I pray I'm wrong.

This is a great answer. I always hate the "humanized animals" in many movies and TV shows. They created false sense of security when not all animals acting the same way in the wild. This reminds me of morons who call a video of a lion eating a buffalo in the wild "Animal Cruelty." What they expect? The Jungle Book?

Volunteered at two zoos in the past 6 years. One had a Docent program, where you essentially stand in front of exhibits to answer questions about animals and politely correct misconceptions you hear. That was at a small zoo, so we were also keepers for pet-like animals that we could take out to the public for a hands on learning experience. The other zoo was essentially like being an unpaid zookeeper, but we were limited in a few tasks we could do or animals we could work with.

Constant communication between zoos. The whole idea of AZA is to promote all zoos to act as a "metapopulation", meaning that all of these endangered animals, while geographically disperse, can still share DNA through loans, trades, and breeding agreements. Is it perfect? Nah, what is?

What is your criteria for a worthy zoo? We have two here in my city. One that is typically expensive and houses only animals that thrive in our climate. The exhibits are all clearly well maintained and designed. The animals always seem very content.  The other runs on donations (suggested is $5 a person, plus grants and patrons and so forth). The animals are "typical" zoo animals--lions, tiger, gorillas, giraffes, polar bears, etc that do not live anywhere near our climate usually. The outdoor enclosures are quite small, for instance the three seals have one circular water track about 10 feet deep, 8 feet wide with some rocks and ledges in the middle, and maybe 200 feet around. Most of the animals need to be kept inside for half the year because the weather is so unseasonal for them. Most were rescued or bred into captivity but most also do not look happy. They seem bored and lethargic much of the time, no matter what time of day we've gone.  I really go back and forth about whether to patronize the latter zoo at all. It makes me very uncomfortable to see the animals seem so depressed. At the same time, I know the keepers care for them and I know they couldn't live in the wild. And it's the only place within driving distance kids can see these animals in person, which I know can be helpful in raising awareness for conservation efforts and so forth.

ONLY go to zoos that are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They are the leaders in conservation, education, animal care and animal welfare. There are lots of "zoos" and wildlife parks that are registered with the USDA, but these are not highly regulated like AZA zoos. Please make sure you are spending money and time at institutions that promote research and conservation all over the world. Joe Bob's Alligator Farm is probably not accredited.

This is a bit of an unfair way to view things. Some smaller zoos aren't big enough to fall under the AZA/ EAZA etc. banner. And other zoos are big enough, but decide not to for other reasons. But these zoos can still be fantastic or at least good in their own right. And these places may still be run by people who love and adore their animals. I work at a zoo in the UK that was once a member of EAZA (European Association of Zoos and Aquariums) and BIAZA (British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums) but decided to leave for a couple of reasons. Example; at our zoo we have plans to bring in animals from Australia that are found nowhere else on the continent. If we were part of those organisations, we wouldn't get the opportunity to get a hold of these animals, because if they became available to EAZA zoos, bigger and more popular zoos would be given priority. Even though the zoo I work at specialises in animals like this. This is just one such problem that we could come across. So rather than saying that you should ONLY go to accredited zoos, just do some research on where you want to visit. If there is a zoo that you aren't sure about, quickly google it. In all likelihood, if there have ever been any controversies or problems there, they'll show up.

I like to think that I had a special relationship will all of the animals under my care. I don't mean to diminish your question in any way, but I learned something every day from every animal I worked with, and that makes them all special to me. Rhinos rule!!!

For animals like Polar Bears that are in zoos that are way out of their typical climate, is there any issues that are hard to fix due to the different climate and do they behave differently then they would in their proper climates?

Many zoos are getting away from hosting animals that are not climatically adapted. This is becoming more and more the norm for zoos around the world. Yes, the behavior changes, but is that due to climate or captivity? We aren't really sure, so we are changing the variable over which we have control.

I don't know enough about marine biology to form a cogent opinion about SeaWorld's policies. IMO elephants, great apes, and cetaceans should probably not be in captivity. Too much time, money, effort, and stress for all organisms involved.

In recent years I've noticed more focus on having activities for animals at zoos that help keep them mentally stimulated. I see puzzles and tool games like this especially in elephant and primate enclosures. Do you feel like we do enough to keep animals mentally fit in captivity? Are there any animals that you feel that zoos could be doing better with in this regard?

This is called "environmental enrichment" which means "toys for animals". It's really that simple. Animal gets bored, don't have enough time to interact? Toy. If you are a parent you will understand.

Do zoos usually require you to specialize in one type of animal? I have spent a few months trying to decide what I want to do with my life, and I realize that zookeeping isn't a super lucrative career and I'd rather do something I love and carve out a modest life than make bank doing something I hate. My desired area would be working with reptiles and aquatic species and I was curious if that'd put me ahead of behind other people who are more interested in working with mammals (also, I've been kinda hoping for one of these for a while now)

It's pretty variable. Some zoos encourage "department hopping" so that staff can fill in when needed. Other zoos want specialists. I'm sorry I can't give you a better answer. Oh, with ectotherms, if that's what you want, that's what you'll do. The skill sets between ecto and endotherms are vastly different.

Thanks for doing the AMA! A few months ago my girlfriend and I went to the zoo and a baby orangutan and his mother were actively looking at us (we were right up to the glass) and putting their hands up to ours (mainly the mom though). We were really fascinated by how the mom seemed to love jewelry and shiny things.  My question being is it normal for primates to show this kind of calm interest in people and their things, or were we just fortunate enough to catch them at a good time?

Were you calm and interested in them? You are, after all, a primate. I don't mean to be flippant, but we are not separated that much from our ape cousins. Their brains work very similarly to ours.

We touch the animals as needed. We try not to "pet" them. Any contact should ideally be used in a husbandry aspect, i.e. to improve their health. And yes, if all you want to do is cuddle, be a dog sitter.

Do the primates in zoos have parasites in their hair/on their skin? On one hand, cleaning parasites off of each other is a special bonding time for primates, but I can also see why skin parasites wouldn't be welcomed in a zoo environment. I saw two monkeys cleaning each other in the San Diego zoo once and I wondered if they were finding anything or just doing it out of instinct.

I reproduce here with permission the comments of an acquaintance of mine with experience in zoo management:  “They had no choice. [Harambe] was not guarding the child, he was pushing him around and getting more agitated. This is not like Brookfield in the 90s. That boy was unconscious and not screaming, and the first animal to reach him was a nursing mother. This was a silverback protecting his family; the dynamics are different. In the wild silverbacks will kill babies from other fathers. It would have taken 10 to 30 minutes for a dart to have worked, and in that time you have a seriously pissed off male gorilla with a screaming 4-year-old.1 The keepers had no choice and they did not shoot him callously. You can blame the mother but I cannot count how many times [my child] slipped away in the blink of an eye. I do not know that she was not watching the child. A slight distraction with another child is the basis of countless tragedies. The kid was 4 so you cannot blame him. 4-year-olds do not have a true sense of danger or outcome which is why we cannot leave them alone. How many of us found ourselves lost as small children because Mom turned a corner and she thought we were with her? Just to note I got lost at about 4 at Brookfield Zoo while watching the brown bears. It happens, it is a tragedy and zoos will need to reexamine their enclosures. Last week 3 lions were killed because a suicidal guy entered their enclosure. [An added note:] for all of the upset over this one animal (and I think this is a tragedy) no one is talking about the slaughter of gorillas in the wild from poaching to the bush meat trade it is devastating what is happening to the wild populations. Focus your energy where the real horror lies.”  The Harambe meme may never die, but it should.

Hello! I am a bio PhD student (predator-prey interactions between big cats and primates), however, a few years back I had the wonderful opportunity to do research on African Wild Dogs at a number of zoos. First off, I find it to be absolutely fantastic regarding how much care the animals get (at least at the zoos I worked with!) and I (as well as many others including the animals!) truly appreciate the love and dedication you guys and gals put into your work! Anyways, I guess I have a two part question! Do you often work with researchers and if so, what were your experiences like? and finally, what would a zookeeper do in the event that a certain animal (I will stick with primates and carnivores since I know more about them) start displaying stereotypic behavior? Do you experiment with different types of enrichment? separate individuals (if in a group)? or give them some privacy regarding the public? Iv had to read up on stereotypic behaviour in canids and felids and I had seen it before, however, I was just curious if the zookeeper had a say in what would happen given such circumstances.  Once again! thank you for your hard work :-) Zoos have always had a huge part in getting the public interested in wildlife which I think helps with conservation efforts!

To get into zookeeping, start applying at zoos. This sounds kinda lame, but it will give you an idea of what zoos look for in candidates. Everyday tasks were always cleaning, feeding and prepping diets. Other than that, we did just about everything. I have learned carpentry, electrical work, plumbing, welding, landscaping, masonry, public speaking, journal writing, chemistry, pharmacology, natural history, and tons of other things in my daily duties as a keeper. In short, there's not much we don't do.  Most keepers these days have some sort of degree beyond secondary school. The pay is not great, but we don't do this to get rich. If I ever did anything else, I would want it to involve environmental education and/or writing.

Animals get out a lot. It's usually just into a service area but occasionally they make it into the public areas. In all fairness it's not that big of a deal usually unless it's a dangerous animal, we usually just lure the animal back in with food treats. We did have a grizzly bear escape when I was still pretty new. That was a gut-wrencher. All the public had to be rounded up and locked in safe areas until the bear was captured. One visitor refused to go inside because he wanted to film the bear. Security ended up pepper spraying him (I was told) to get him to move. At one point he was apparently only about 12-15 feet away from the bear.  Edit: I wanted to clarify; when I say "animals get out a lot" I meant that it happens often enough that keepers don't usually freak out about it.  
Nah. The bear had eaten a 5 lb. jar of peanut butter prior to escaping. She wouldn't have eaten him, just played with him til he didn't move anymore.

They most certainly have friends.  I can think of two of ours in particular that are "best friends". They work well as a pair and always graze near each other, even when they have calves. There are another group of three cows we have that, by necessity due to calving dates, are placed in the same grouping. They were not originally together. While they tolerate each other,  they are very clearly not friends. In wintertime, we put our cows into indoor housing. Each shed has multiple compartments that can hold about five/six cows in each compartment. We have to take into account which cows like/dislike each other in order to have groupings that don't fight with each other.

I used to live in house that was enclosed on 3 sides by dairy farm fields. There was one particular cow that would come over to the fence and just hang out and let me scratch it's nose. There were also a group of 10 cows that would crowd around if our lab was in the yard. They'd play with him. He would run back and forth along the fence and the cows would follow him, a little slowly.

I have gone in with rhinos before (read: no barriers). It's not really recommended, but it's possible. I know of places where keepers work their rhinos free contact (no barriers), it all depends on the animal. Most rhinos I've worked with love human interaction and will actively seek out someone to "talk to".

Rhinos are my absolute FAVORITE animal ever. If I ever got to touch one I would melt into a pool of happiness, I can't even imagine!

Rhino behind the scene tours are pretty common. Check with your local zoo, then proceed to melt. Also, visitors like you are some of our favorites. :)

What you don't get right here is the vocalizations that the rhino calf is making. They squeak. Check out /r/babyrhinogifs for more cool videos.

I got to feed a baby rhino once. It was awesome! Like a soft, slimy handshake. :)

The first rhino calf I ever worked with was extremely inquisitive. At the time I was required to wear running shoes to work because my Achilles' tendon had become too inflamed for me to wear my work boots. The calf would often suck on my boots when she was near the gate, kinda like a pacifier. When I had my runners on (with really knobby soles), she got this look on her face like, "what the hell?" and spent a long, long time exploring my weird shoe with her mouth. At the end my shoe was soaked and I was laughing so hard I got the hiccups.

If there is a zoo near you, just volunteer. A good zoo volunteer is worth his/her weight in gold and often gets to do almost everything a keeper does. We had one volunteer that taught the black rhino bull to paint with his lip.

Do the animals really sleep that much or am I just going at the wrong times?  
Do the animals really sleep that much or am I just going at the wrong times?  
The animals sleep that much. Think about your cat (you're on reddit so I know you have one). That thing sleeps constantly, right? The big cats are just larger, lazier versions. Other animals sleep a lot during the day simply because that's their biology. To see more active animals, go during cooler parts of the year or in the early morning or evening.

Do you ever give the big cats catnip?  
Yes, among other things. This falls under the category of "enrichment". We would do all sorts of stuff to get the cats active. The lions loved yellow mustard and Vap-o-rub of all things. At one point, we had a goat that was a companion animal for some of our nervous hoofstock and we would walk him through the lion and tiger exhibits while we cleaned them so he could pee/poop in them. When the cats came out, they went nuts looking for the goat that they knew had to be there somewhere.

What's the most dangerous situation that you've ever been in? Did anyone get hurt in that situation?  
We were transporting an anesthetized tiger to the vet clinic for some routine exams when he "woke up" in the van. He opened his eyes, lifted his head, and placed his mouth around a keeper's leg. No one was injured but pants were shat. The worst I've ever gotten was a torn up knee during a bison immobilization.

I probably would have had a heart attack and died if a tiger put my leg in it's mouth.  An unlikely situation, since I sort of avoid zoos because of the tigers. They're one of my biggest phobias. Any advice on how to get over the phobia?

Volunteer at a zoo and try to work in areas with animals that freak you out. After about a week of being scared shitless, you just kinda stop freaking out and just start treating it like a job. My first time working the big cats by myself, I was a nervous wreck. After about 2 weeks of having lions and tigers roar at you while you feed them and move them around, it just kinda becomes noise.

Slowly desentisize yourself. Do this by looking at pictures of tigers at first then build up to going to a zoo and looking at them from far away and then move closer. Something along those lines.  I am not a Doctor or a Psychiatrist.

Animals pass away all the time, it's one of the shittier aspects to the job. I've never been involved directly with any human fatalities, but they do happen. Elephants are one of the more dangerous animals to work with b/c they are so damn intelligent. If an elephant decides it wants you dead, you're pretty well screwed. Visitors fall into enclosures occasionally, but usually it just freaks the animal out and they go hide while the visitor gets fished out.

There are a ton, but the one that pops to mind right now is when a bull rhino broke out of his shipping crate as we were getting ready to send him to another zoo. He poked a hole in the wall with his horn and just proceeded to demolish the crate. We had to custom build a solid steel crate for him in the end.

The first crate was steel framed with 2x12 pressure-treated lumber for the walls/roof/floor/doors, so not cheap in its own right. But yeah, the all steel crate was a couple grand IIRC.

The rhinos are really laid back. Most people expect them to be aggressive and short-tempered, but if you have time to give belly rubs and scratches, they are your best friends. The asshole animal I was most surprised by was a Goodfellow's tree kangaroo. The females we had were super laid back and easy to work with. The male? Well let's just say he was so mean he would chew on his own testicles to get himself worked up before he came after us.

Coolest display of animal intelligence you've seen?  
I'm sure there are tons of examples with primates and some bird species, but since I don't work a lot with them, I have to say that warthogs (and other wild pig species) have impressed me the most. I watched a male warthog figure out how to disarm an electric fence so he could get to part of his exhibit where we were trying to establish new plants. He used his tusk (which doesn't conduct electricity) to pull the fence down and short it out.

Not a zoo story but when I was a kid living in the middle of nowhere in Scotland, my parents decided to get a pair of pigs to eventually get slaughtered for meat. They had a roofed enclosure but my parents decided to section off part of the garden with an electric fence so the pigs could also enjoy being outside. The first few times one of the pigs touched the fence, it took off like a bat out of hell. Unfortunately, it took off forwards, charging straight through the fence and wrenching the lightweight metal posts out of the ground and the connections loose. After setting it all back up each time, the Pigs eventual learnt not to touch it and all was good for a while.  Until, one day, we discovered the pigs in the strawberry plot. Expecting to find the electric fence once again in tatters we guided them back to their pen only to discover it apparently intact. Bemused at how they had escaped, we put them back in.  They managed to escape several more times, always when no-one was watching until we eventually caught them in the act.  To provide them a little shelter we'd placed a wooden pallet in the corner of their pen slanted at an angle, where the wall on one side met the electric fence on another. The Houdini pigs were backing off to get a good run at it and then charging up the wooden pallet before matrix style wall running over the fence to land on the grass at the other side. TL; DR; Houdini pigs wall run over electric fence.

Are the animals happy?  
Thank you for asking this. This question does not have a simple answer, so I will try to talk through it some. I can say beyond a doubt that the animals in "good" zoos receive excellent care (I put good in quotes because there's always a shitty version of something). I would also feel comfortable saying that keepers make it a point to keep their animals as content as possible, partly because we love our animals, also, it's easier to work with a calm animal than an agitated one. There are always individuals that do not adapt to their surroundings. We work very hard to make sure these instances are few and far between, but the simple fact is, there is no way to be 100% successful in the animal care field. You do the best you can and learn from your (and others') mistakes. I would finish by saying I am certain I would not have done this for so long had I thought the animals were not happy, I don't think I could take it.

Favorite part of the job? And least favorite?  
Favorite part of the job? And least favorite?  
Best part has to be working directly with some really fascinating animals. Most zookeepers I know kinda see their work animals as "theirs", kinda like pets but not really (I know that answer sucks, but I don't know how else to put it). Least favorite has to be huge crowds during busy seasons (spring break, Easter, Thanksgiving). So many people in one place make it very difficult to do the job sometimes.

When's the best time to go to the zoo/see the most out of the animals?  
Dusk or dawn (or as close as you can get to it). Animals are always more active around these times. They spend most of the daylight hours sleeping. It's also around these times (early and late) that a lot of animals get fed.

I was at the Phoenix zoo once waiting for my flight. It was July midafternoon and it was 104°, so all the animals were chilling in the shade except some of the savanna prey. There was a Mexican dude yelling at the Lions to do something. There was also a black panther pacing his cage and growling. He reminded me of my black cat, bear. She was 22lbs and built like a leopard.

What do you do if an animal escapes the zoo and gets beyond the walls? Also is it anything like The Mighty Boosh?  
What do you do if an animal escapes the zoo and gets beyond the walls? Also is it anything like The Mighty Boosh?  
Don't know anything about "The Mighty Boosh" (just googled it and bookmarked videos for later). If the animal gets beyond the perimeter of the zoo a lot of different things can happen. If the animal is considered "not dangerous" it is usually just recaptured, usually with the help of the local police. If the animal is an immediate and likely danger to the public, it is usually killed to prevent any human injuries. Escapes beyond perimeter are exceedingly rare to my knowledge.

What's the easiest and most difficult animal to feed?  
What's the easiest and most difficult animal to feed?  
Most keepers will give different answers for this. To me, each animal had its pros and cons, food wise. Hoofstock is easy because it's usually just hay and some pelleted diet. Cats are easy because you feed once a day and they pretty well clean everything up. I'd say that kangaroos were my least favorite to deal with, diet wise. They make huge messes.

It might be an inappropriate question to ask, but can I ask a rough idea on how much you make?   
It might be an inappropriate question to ask, but can I ask a rough idea on how much you make?   
I'm glad someone asked this. Keepers don't get paid much at all. It is more or less dependent on the price of living in the area. Zoos in smaller towns may only pay $10 or so an hour, maybe even less. Zoos in larger areas, and on the west coast can pay upwards of $20 per hour. The most I ever made was a salary of 25k per year.

There was a drunk lady that had snuck beer into the zoo (the zoo didn't allow any alcohol on grounds) and was spitting it at the animals. She thought she was going to "get them to do something". We introduced her to the nice policeman that worked for us.

This was one of the few AMA's that I've read every comment. Thoroughly enjoyable.  As I am a redditor, I have 2 cats and my favorite thing to see them do is to annoy the hell out of each other. Is this common place among the big cats, or any other exotic animals?

I've never heard of any sort of compromising situations. Doesn't mean they don't happen, but if they do I've gotta think it's exceedingly rare. If I never work with spotted hyenas again, I'll be okay with that. They were one of two animals (the other being a jaguar) that ever looked at me and made me feel like food.

We had an incident in my hometown pittsburgh zoo with the spotted dogs. A kid fell in the enclosure around feeding time. Well, you can guess what happend.

Yeah, I remember that story. It was not pretty at all. The African wild dog is a brutally efficient predator.

Exactly. This is why people think they would make good pets. That's not entirely false, but think of your cat (once again, you're on reddit, I know you have one), most of the time your cat's a relatively placid creature, content to sleep and tolerate your brief attention. Every now and then, that cat spazzes out and claws/bites/kicks for no real reason. With a house cat, no big deal. With a 500 lb. lion? Big deal. Ask Roy Horn.

What's the most dangerous situation you or one of your coworkers have ever been in while working there?  
What's the most dangerous situation you or one of your coworkers have ever been in while working there?  
That's a tough question. We did/do things of questionable safety as a matter of course. The rhino breaking out of his crate was probably the most danger I've ever been in. As he was tearing the crate apart, shards of wood were flying everywhere. I watched a video of it later and saw multiple wooden missiles pass within inches of my face. I didn't realize it at the time b/c I was so focused on the rhino. Edit: I just remembered a procedure we did on a wildebeest once in the field. We had darted a bull to move him to a different area and as our vet was checking his vitals, the bull kicked, missing the vet's head by about a cm. The vet never even noticed because he was listening to the stethoscope, but he damn near died.

As OP has no penguins at their zoo, I'll share this with you: http://www.edinburghzoo.org.uk/animals-attractions/sir-nils-olav/ Also, the penguins at Edinburgh Zoo do a daily, voluntary, parade through a part of the zoo. It started when some of them escaped quite a few years ago, and they were fine just walking about the zoo. From then on the keepers just opened the gate to their enclosure once per day. The penguins are not lured, scared or pushed into doing this in any way.

What is the story with the lemur escape mentioned in the original post  
What is the story with the lemur escape mentioned in the original post  
The ring-tailed lemurs were exhibited on a fake island. They were kept on the island primarily by an electric fence. At one point the fence shorted out and no one realized except the lemurs. Three of the 8 or so on exhibit jumped the moat and climbed the back of the service area into some trees. We spent most of our time waiting for the public to kind of "clear out" of the area so we could dart the little bastards (lemurs, not public). Once they were darted and drugged, we just picked them up and put them back in their indoor holding area til the exhibit was fixed. All in all pretty boring, but at the time our curator was losing his mind.

I'd love to see a draft! PM me and I'll give you an e-mail address. 1. Absolutely. I miss my rhinos every single day. These relationships also make losing animals due to old age or any other reason really shitty. 2. Not necessarily in an enclosure, but when I worked at an open range zoo I got caught away from my vehicle in an area where 6 addax cows had creched their calves. I was stuck playing ring-around-the-rosie with 6 pissed off mamas. 3. It sounds cheesy, but the times when I absolutely knew this was the job for me were any time I could see wonder in a visitor's eyes. We get really blase' sometimes about what we do. Seeing someone else experience how cool it really is helps a lot.

You are definitely headed in the right direction. I would suggest volunteering at as many different types of wildlife places as you can to get an idea of what you really like. Zoos, rehab center, exotic vets, wildlife centers, anyplace that deals with animals. If you're just graduating, you have a little while to explore what you want to do. I was out of school for a couple of years before I landed at a zoo. I honestly thought I would work there for a couple of years, tops...14 years later I'm doing an AMA on what I love.  
I've been a zookeeper for the better part of 14 years. AMA.
I'm both intrigued and completely disgusted by hyenas. Everything about them seems to be in stark contrast with how other animals have evolved. Their social structure and their mating habits, even their physical attributes (long front legs). Everything about them seems so backwards and like....a strange mutation that shouldn't have taken hold, but it did. My question to you is, do you interact with them at all? If so, do they act like dogs? I love animals oh so much but these ones I just get completely freaked out about. How are their behaviors around a human that they know?

I worked with two spotted hyenas, "Caesar" and "Charlie". Caesar was parent-raised and Charlie was hand-raised. Charlie liked interaction. He would press up against the fences to be brushed and "talked to". Caesar was the Devil in a hyena suit. He is one of two animals that has ever made me really feel like food. As far as acting like dogs? No, not really. This sounds kinda flippant, but they act like hyenas. Their social structure and natural history is so unique that they don't have any real good analogues behavior-wise.

I just want to say thank you for this AMA. Back when I was growing up I always wanted to be a zookeeper but sadly I never followed my dreams and tried the whole 'join corporate america' thing my parents told me to do... Now I'm going to start volunteering at my local zoo and at least live out some part of my dream to work at a zoo. Without this AMA I would have not even known volunteering at a zoo was even a thing, so thanks!

I don't know. I thought, through all this, he was the last one who was still sort of there for me. To find out it was the complete opposite was just so much to take. I wanted to call him and yell and scream but if I do that I might ruin this.

 I wanted to call him and yell and scream but if I do that I might ruin this.  Put it on the back burner. You're right. Lots of potential for good stuff to happen in your life. Probably better to focus on that right now.

I can't fully relate but my dad was lying about his income for many years as I helped him with bills.  I still don't know where his money went. That doesn't matter but after all of it that was just time to accept that you were wrong. The worst thing to do is be hard on yourself or not trust other people. I know people in the world can be cruel and it's worse when it's your family (my issue wasn't just with him) but the thing is most people are good.  They really are.  I hope you and everyone do make up but if nothing else that you forgive them.  The reason I say that is for you not them.  You didn't deserve any of that but you also don't deserve to feel angry or upset.  It's not healthy.  Much love your way man.  I'm proud you told someone because bottling it up only makes it worse. Even if it's just reddit.  I speak from experience.

best to wait a month or two to relax and see how everything else goes and everythign is good, send him a "I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed" type message, those are the worst haha

Ok so I know we didn't go through even close to the same thing but I did have a very racist, controlling, uncaring and assholeish father. He died about 3 months ago now. My relationship with my parents was not very good to say the least for the past few years. I was always the black sheep for various reasons. Anyway to make a long story short, my mother who used to defend everything about my father now truly realizes how much of a dick he was. She is a wonderful grandmother to my 3 year old and feels horrible that most of my childhood memories were tarnished by such a complete turd burgler. Things will work out with your mom and sister. They probably now have realized that your dad was a dick and want to be a family more than memorialize that dingleberry. Now your brother...punch his lying sadistic ass in the throat.

I'm more stunned by the truth, he was unfaithful and rather than face it he committed suicide. It seems, to me, that was the true testament of my father's person. He was, and it hurts me to say this about my own father, a weak, weak man. My mother hasn't explicitly said she regrets him, but in the way she wasn't standoffish and wasn't against meeting my children, if anything she asked to do it. As for my brother, I don't know if I can forgive him. Ever.

Your brother was damaged in different, but similar ways by your shared upbringing. His reaction/deed may have been partially born from that, and perhaps jealousy of your courage to get away and do your own thing. Give him a chance to explain, but maybe punch him in the throat first :) Good luck man.

when things calm down, let him explain himself.  he did a truly awful thing to you, but humans fuck up and as you are seeing with your mother, they can change. they can learn.  leave the possibility open.

What was the race of the woman your father was cheating with? Sorry to hear about this. Good luck with your brother; What he did is inexcusable, but I'm sure he had some reasoning to justify it in his own head. I hope that you two can get to the bottom of it and make up as brothers.  On a personal note: My wife and I fell in love despite the religious differences of our families. Went through hell, but finally got married 10 years later with blessings of both families. You are right...love conquers all!

That's awesome, you and your wife sound super sweet. When my little brother was a kid, he would smile and say, "Mom, just love," when she was upset or frustrated, (even if it was with him, lol, he was the best at getting us out of trouble) and it always made her laugh. She still says that, just love; it fits in all sorts of situations.

No, no, no. I understand your frustration and disappointment with your brother.   Do not start another family feud.   Simply thank him for giving you mom's number. Tell him that she's coming to visit and you are looking forward to mending the delicate fabric of this family that has been torn.  Tell him about the weight that has lifted from shoulders now that you know the truth behind Dad's suicide via your mom. Let him know that you hope, in the future, he feels free to unburden family secrets. Maybe your brother was keeping this factoid a secret to hide the shame of what your dad did, how your mother hurt and maybe he also felt betrayed; unfortunately at your expense.   Don't wring his neck, be the wonderful person that you are. Be empathetic.   Good luck.

Who knows what his reasons are. When you call him he'll obviously know that you've spoken with your mother. Maybe ask your brother "is there something you want to tell me?". Give him the opportunity. Open the space for it so he doesn't have to awkwardly blurt it out. If he chooses not to speak, that's his decision.

Did your brother idolize your father?  Maybe it was just too much for him to believe that your father died because he was ashamed of being caught cheating.  Maybe it was easier for him to blame you at first.  I don't know,  this was just the first thing I thought,  it's all very tragic and I'm sorry you went through it.

This really got to me. I really love happy or bittersweet endings/new beginnings. We don't choose our parents. They make mistakes, sometimes big ones, sometimes unforgivable ones. As they get older sometimes they get haunted by them.  I hope your mother is sincere and I hope everything works out for your family. Family can be the greatest gift or the heaviest burden, but it's always there in the back of our minds even if we don't speak for decades. Peace and love is so much better for everyone. You've been through a lot but maybe it will all pay off in the end. I wish you all the best.

Idk man, it's good I guess if you want to reconnect but if I remember correctly your family are a bunch of racist biggots, if that's the case, they wouldn't be worth my time if I was you. You never have an obligation to your family, I don't love my mother because I came out of her vagina, I love my mother because she's been there for me for 22 years and I know she is there for me if I need her.  If they've changed, great, if not, don't be guilted ( by them or yourself ) to do anything you don't have to.

Yeah, I was clear with my mother that her old attitude is not accepted in my house, near my family, and especially near my kids. I won't have it. I don't feel guilted per se , I feel like it's a good chance to move on and grow together. If she can't, we'll know.

Hey u/happygoshmucky, I'm sorry for your loss. This will probably get buried but I just want to share with you my story. I want to let you know how brave you were to have still married your wife when your family was so against the idea as to disown you. I know that "love prevails" feelings, I've felt it too. I actually had a black boyfriend and my parents were very against it and threatened to disown me as well. My mother was crying and kept saying that she would go insane if I were to marry a black man (my family is oriental but also very old-fashioned). At the time, my love for him was very strong and I was ready to let my family go if it were to come down to it. But, I broke up with him, not because of this conflict but other things that just happens naturally between two people. Perhaps my family did have some subconscious effect on me. I thought about my feelings before the break up long and hard - to try to separate my actual feelings about him and my family matter. Alas, I think it was the right decision to break up with him because my family was not the cause. However, my point is, is that if my feelings hadn't changed for him, and my mother killed herself (because she likely would - I could picture it). I would be in the same situation as you before. The beliefs your parent(s) and mine and others' hold are so wrong but they don't know that because they've been taught that way by their parents or society or whatever. It's fucked up and I cried about it thinking why did I have to be born in a family like this? I'm so happy for this story although I'm so sorry about your loss, in the end something good came out of it. I hope you and your family lead a wonderful life :)

You're family is fucked and they don't deserve to know your family if that's how they handle things, you're better off without them. Your Dad was a racist prick and your Mother allowed that to be the reason your wife and kids never met your family. Run, son. Start your own traditions.

It might be because it is late but I am so happy for you I am crying. I don't usually do that. I am so proud of you and your wife for having the strength to do that. Be strong and be well.  Also I hope you and your brother come to an understanding at some point. But perhaps it's best to cross one bridge at a time. <3 All the best man.

This post does seem a bit iffy to me. The OP put a lot of detail into the emotionality of every tiny event, which isn't really how people normally recount things. This honestly reads like a fictional story to me.

It's fresh to me. Like, really really really fresh. I don't know how else to recount this other than exactly how I remember it. Reading it back it does look like I hired William Faulkner to write it.

You must not have a lot of extended family you don't see.  Because there's family I haven't seen since I was a child who seem to somehow know everything about my life. It's the internet. It happens.

There's a difference between not seeing family and having cut off all ties with them. I do see your point though

With all my heart, I truly hope this works out for your family. I really hope they (your biological family) doesn't end up doing anything horrible. If it does work out, how amazing of for your wife & kids. Way to go, OP. I wouldn't have been able to make that call.

I was tearing up reading that.  My family has always been a huge part of my life.  I can't imagine the pain of being disowned.  I sincerely hope that you all get along and enjoy each other's company while they are visiting.  I hope you and your mom stay in touch and grow closer than you ever imagined possible. I guess I should ask a question.  Do you plan on telling your kids the truth about why they didn't see their grandma for the first part of their lives?

It really depends. If this goes well, no. Or at least not until they're old enough to get the point of what racism and bigotry is. If this doesn't go well, I'll have to decide.

This is amazing OP! Congratulations! Are your kids excited to meet your family? Are you excited to see them? How do you think they'll treat your wife? May I ask you how long it took take take racist thoughts from your mind? I know you said you were looking at women of other races since you were a teen, but did any stereotypes linger into adulthood? How has your opinion of your Dad changed now?

I read a lot of the first AMA, but I didn't say anything. I feel like a chorus of people saying, "Wow, I'm sorry your family sucks," and, "Maybe you should reach out" had already  been done. This though is such a happy moment I couldn't not add to the congratulations and well wishes. I hope all goes well while they visit and that your family can truly begin to heal.

Dude congratulations. You have shown us all what having balls, guts, chutzpah, etc. can do for someone's life. You did what you needed to do to be happy in the face of overwhelming adversity by marrying your wife, and then AGAIN by making this phone call. Nobody can take these accomplishments away from you.  I'm sorry your dad died and put that guilt on you, but I'm glad that his poison is gone from your life and you're free from that guilt now.

I can't say anything more. I'll ask a question since I think I have to even with casual amas. Do you think your mother truly believed in white supremacy in the past or do you think it was your father stringing her along? It's not the first time a mother 'neglected' her child because of the father's wishes after all.

 Do you think your mother truly believed in white supremacy in the past or do you think it was your father stringing her along?  I'll be honest and say part of my wife and my nervousness is that people don't change like this overnight. Yeah, granted it's been years, but I'm just so skeptical to think she really changed. So I don't know.

I'm so happy for you, this is such a big step in the right direction for both of you. Your story really touched me, I am estranged from both my parents for a different reason. But what I do understand is the horrible feeling of what its like to have no mum or dad anymore. Its so hard to live with. For me, it breaks my heart that my family doesn't accept me, doesn't want a relationship with me and partner. I desire so much for their acceptance and love, but I know inside I'll never achieve it. So congratulations, this is truly wonderful and gives me a bit of hope that one day my family will love me again too. Cheers to you mate.

When I saw the post earlier, the sheer brilliance of "shh bby is ok" really struck a chord with me. There's one thing I simply have to know though. What made you say it? Why those specific words, why that spelling, just... why. I feel this is of similar importance to The Ultimate Question from H2G2. As far as I'm concerned, and I think the late great Douglas Adams would probably agree, "shh bby is ok" would've been a perfectly acceptable Answer for Deep Thought to give. You may have just won real life.

Details, girlfriend!  
Details, girlfriend!  
She was normal enough in person.  The date did go terribly south though, and it wasn't really anyone's fault.  I received a call from my mother during the date, which I immediately picked up because my mom was with my grandmother who was dying of senile dementia.  My grandmother had returned to a lucid state after not being mentally "there" at all for at least a week, and so the last time I talked with her before she died was right in the middle of the date, outside the bar.  As you can imagine, it completely wrecked the mood (I explained what the call was about to her), and neither of us tried to contact the other afterwards. So you got a good story out of me about it, but it's probably not the kind of saucy details about her you were looking for.  But even if there were any I wouldn't divulge them; it's not nice to be mean about someone on the Internet like that, especially when they can't defend themselves.  I've been a target of that kind of stuff enough myself, and wouldn't wish it on anyone.

She's probably just trying to force your character into question since she has so little to grasp at. EDIT: Since this AMA is picking up and in case people continue to comment: I say this regardless of how I personally feel about him, the leak, etc. I neither say he is a bad person nor a good person, it is simply a comment on the obvious bias of the writer.

Some guy I know went on 4chan  for the first time ever because of the photos this week. He found it baffling and came away disappointed. I'm guessing that's what "inaccessible" means here. More user-unfriendly than literally inaccessible.

You don't see the irony in posting the things you made freely public online, you getting butt hurt over it enough to post this comment, and many other people who have made the argument that if the celebs were not idiots, they wouldn't have taken the pictures and stored them on the internet in the first place. Isn't that what you did with your post history?

Why exactly should he be awarded privacy when he had no respect for the privacy of those celebrities? Just because he didn't personally hack them doesn't make him innocent because he still decided to make a subreddit so people could spread these photos far and wide and fap to them. He is a guilty party and has no right to bitch about how his privacy is being breached.

That article is pretty terrible.

Also, acting as if 4chan is "highly inaccessible" is just a lie. Implying that the pictures wouldn't get onto Reddit in the first place is just ridiculous.

 How do you feel about the washington post basically trying to dox you?  Otherwise known as "investigative journalism". "No doxxing" is a Reddit rule, it doesn't apply in the real world.

Well, Caitlin Dewey seems like someone who was just out for revenge. There was very little relevant information in there and the rest was just mean spirited and overly personal. She would probably argue that it's what he helped to do to her heroes, the celebrities, so he deserved it, though that makes her no better than the people who actually leaked the photos. Then again, I don't know what I expected from a shitrag like the Washington Post.

Where do you stand on the "Was this leaking event and our viewing of the pictures moral?" debate?

These pics would be posted regardless. Me and the mod team tried to ensure the content posted was in line with reddit's rules.

You didn't actually answer your question.  It wasn't whether you "followed the rules", nor whether "someone else would have done it".   The question is where you stand on whether leaking/viewing (and sharing by logical extension) the photos moral in your opinion? Personally I have not looked at the photos because I think it's incredibly fucked up to invade anyone's privacy this way, even though I personally don't think nudity is a big deal.  I personally also don't think "someone else would have done it" is a good reason to do something wrong.

I took it as a "no,  it wasn't moral, but it was going to happen anyway"

This is a copy/paste from a comment I made on the day after the photos were leaked: I find it fascinating that people aren't a bit pissed off by this.  Sure, we get to see naked pics of people we see on TV, but this was a planned "attack" on these people.  Someone coordinated the hacks and has been selling these pictures to people online.  Isn't that a little bit fucked up? The world is outraged by the NSA and its actions, but nobody gives a shit when someone steals naked pictures and sells them to strangers on the Internet.  Seriously?  You want your own privacy to be secured, but if someone else's privacy is invaded so you can jerk off, that's okay, right?   I know, most of these actresses have shown skin in their movies, but this is totally different.  When someone agrees to be shown naked in a movie, they do it of their own will for the sake of the movie (and money, I suppose).  You can't just say "Well, they've already shown us most of it.  Might as well see the rest".  Most actors/actresses draw a line and this crosses that line.  And now, they have to live with the fact that millions of people have seen those images.  They will have to keep their head held high for PR reasons, but I'm sure that some of them feel incredibly violated.  I know that I would feel violated if someone hacked into my Dropbox account and downloaded my schoolwork, which doesn't even compare to what has happened to these people. And don't even give me that bullshit "She should have protected her data better".  I keep my TV in my living room.  If someone breaks my window and takes my TV, should I have protected my TV better?  Was I at fault for putting my TV in a place that is easy for me to get to?  I locked my windows and doors but someone got to it anyway.  Obviously, things like naked pictures should be kept more secure than a TV.  I'm a tech-savvy guy and I know this.  But to the standard individual, a password is like putting something into a lockbox.  Don't blame the victim when the perp is the one who committed the crime. I'm sorry that I'm piggybacking off of you, but I was getting so annoyed with people on this site. Damn near every post on /r/all mentions "the fappening".  I think it's fucked up that we now have online "communities" to discuss this shit.  I'm a 20 year old guy... and honestly I would have liked to see some revealing images of JLaw or Kate Upton. It's human nature.  But I honestly can't be a part of this.  The damage is done and it doesn't help anything, but I find it sickening that people are okay with what happened.

It's not that people are "okay" with it. As in they actively say down and asked themselves "is this right or wrong?" They just don't give a fuck.

Sign of the times. We get angry when our own privacy is threatened by corporations and government, but there are still so many people who demonstrate exactly what they would do when someone else's privacy is in their collective hands.  
/r/IAmA is reserved for people who aren't "Internet Famous". Or are at least famous for a reason other than an identity that Reddit is responsible for.  
Minus that second sentence. Youtubers and bad luck Brian got taken down. I don't think reddit is personally responsible for a meme and youtubers have barely any relation to reddit whatsoever

But people that work for reddit are allowed AMAs. Gotta love our admins and mods.  
Good question. Ask the mods of /r/IAMA.  
It's barred under rule 8 in the wiki.  Posts about your experiences on the internet are allowed if it can be objectively determined that the activity is a significant portion of your life, using factors such as income received, time devoted to it, uniqueness and level of creativity, and outside attention it gets. Also consider /r/InternetAMA.  I'm sure this will front page anyway.

While I understand the idea, my understanding of the admin policy is that they want to enable free speech as far as possible within the extent of the law. Hence why jailbait was banned because of the risk of CP, or how the celeb nudes leak could have potential criminal backdraft, while the sub you linked may not be violating any particular laws. How they got their images I can't say, since there's no way I'm gonna click on that link.  Alternately, they're doing what they can for publicity reasons - the media talked about Jailbait and The Fappening and not about the other stuff, and they want to avoid as much bad publicity as possible.

Exactly. People who say that reddit is hypocritical for banning /r/thefappening and allowing other much worse subreddits are missing the reason why /r/thefappening was banned in the first place. It wasn't because /r/thefappening was so morally wrong that the admins decided that it had no place on a website like reddit, therefore bringing up morally objectionable subreddits that weren't banned is irrelevant. It was banned because of the legal issues that a sub like /r/thefappening brings. The admins job isn't to be the moral compass for all of reddit, they allow us to create our own subreddits and set our own ground rules for what is morally objectionable. Their job is to keep the site running and to make sure that what other subs consider morally acceptable for them is also legal and not in risk of breaking the site.

I don't see why people are that surprised, reditt is is huge company now and there can be no guarantee for content when addessing pr and legal concerns.

As soon as the media started talking about /r/Jailbait the number of people visiting that subreddit increased dramatically, also the number of people posting actual child porn increased dramatically. Maybe banning it was partially due to bad publicity, bit I think it was mostly due to the increasing difficulties in keeping the content legal.

Honestly I don't give a shit about celebrities (or their nudes) so /r/TheFappening wasn't my thing. Was the sub created for a single source / treasure trove of pics that were leaked, or was the idea to get additional sources involved? If there was a single source, the "well would've run dry" so to speak. Would the sub just become irrelevant after awhile?

I created /r/TheFappening because I liked the name and checked if the sub was up, and when it wasn't, I created it. I fully expected the sub to wane as time went on in popularity. Banning it shocked me. Especially after all the traffic we'd had over the last wee.

I didn't post them. I didn't host them. These pics would be posted regardless and I tried to make sure my community was in line with reddit's rules.

Follow up question, If you didn't want to post  the pictures and apparently pictures in general "don't do it for you" then why did you even create the subreddit,I'm curious?  Also when I meant "host",what I meant was  making a subreddit where you could post pictures not literately host the image sorry if I didn't make that clear.

I created the sub because I thought "/r/TheFappening" was an awesome subreddit name. When it exploded, I just did what I can to ensure the community stayed in line with Reddit's rules. BTW, I didn't I don't get anything from these pics.

That's pretty interesting,one person who liked a name made reddit history and international news.  Also one thing the mod team should get credit for is that they did seem to mod the sub well.

Are you indeed asexual, as the article suggests?

 While yes I did enjoy the pictures,I felt bad because I was violating someones privacy.  That's not a moral dilemma is. If you're in a moral dilemma, there's some ambiguity as to the moral course of action. Here you clearly know what the right thing to do is, but you're compelled away from it because of your libido/pleasure impulse.

I just wanna leave a post here to say that, while I agree that Reddit is often hypocritical in what content it allows, usually in proportion to how a questionable subreddit is reflecting on the site as a whole, I think what you and others did is illegal for a reason, namely because it's morally reprehensible. For all I know you have your own elaborate justifications for why it's actually okay to invade others' privacy like that, and maybe you yourself are not a bad person, but that shit's still fucked up and you need to reevaluate your life and your relationship to other people if you think it's okay.

It was weird, it was like having dreams while I was awake. Although I may have been asleep for some of it because when it was so dark and quiet it was hard to know when I had really slept. It is hard to explain this. But mostly I saw and heard people that I know.

Man that's intense. I once got locked in a closet when I was 14 for four hours before my cousin came home and got me out. Couldn't use an elevator because of the resulting claustrophobia for about ten years after that.  Did you end up getting teased at school?

No one teased me at school because only my boyfriend and my best friend knew. I was out for the entire week and I just told people that I was sick.

I remember playing hide and seek with my sister and cousins at my grandma's house when I was young. I climbed into a closet and curled up under the bottom shelf. I stuck my fingers under the door crack and pulled it towards me until it closed. And then I had the horrifying realization that there was no door knob on that side of the door. Even if there was, I wouldn't have been able to reach it with the shelf completely above me. I wasn't in there for 5 seconds before I started screaming my head off until my sister let me out. I was lucky, but the thought that I could have been in a situation where it would have taken someone longer to find me really freaks me out.

Then I definitely would have died, from what someone else said, humans can live 3-5 days without water. So I could have survived 5 days in there. I shudder to imagine what it would have been like after 5 days.

I'm sure if that happens the school, your parents or the police will eventually find you, but you would probably have no hope, no certainty that someone will find you, to me that seems a lot more scary than the physical stuff

That is something I worried about while in there. If I would have died, then my boyfriend would have been in trouble since it was his locker. I mean who would ever have assumed that I had done that to myself? I had no way to tell anyone that I had done it myself.

Ugh. That literally made my heart stop for a second. On the other hand, it makes for kind of a cool story. Girl gets trapped in a locker for days, experiences these crazy hallucinations. During one of these hallucinations, she witnesses a murder. In reality, she really did see a murder but her lucid state made her think otherwise. You know? Maybe?

My claustrophobia was sitting on top of my chest through this entire read, but I have to ask: Why didn't you just tell the teacher the combination to the lock? You must have known it to have opened it in the first place.

After all that time trapped inside there I wasn't thinking straight anymore. And he didn't really stay long, he didn't even ask if I knew the number and I didn't even think to tell it too him. That was something my boyfriend wanted to know too because his lock was ruined.

I put the lock on the door, closed the lock and then pulled the door shut, that was just how our lockers worked.  
I put the lock on the door, closed the lock and then pulled the door shut, that was just how our lockers worked.  
Come to think of it, and in the chance it's still not the case, all lockers should have a "safe exit", a "unlock from the inside" kind of thing. It's not like books will run away, so this would really protect anyone who ever got trapped for whatever reason.

I see. What a traumatic experience, a claustrophobic nightmare. Did you develop claustrophobia after this happened? Mine began after getting myself stuck in a storage compartment of a camper while playing hide and seek as a kid. I wasn't in there for more than 15 minutes before my brother got me out but the fear has remained. My chest tightens just thinking about it.

Actually no I didn't, see my second to last paragraph in my story. To be honest, this experience developed something else in me, but I am not sure if it is okay to mention adult topics here. You can message me and I can tell you if you'd like to know.

He may not have made a big deal about it but rather just mentioned "hey I think my lock is jacked." And even if he did make a big deal, which seems ridiculous to presume... It was a high school kid in like 1998. For all I know that lock cost him a days pay at work, idk.

After reading this, this gives me a new perspective on my (once thought) overly involved/overly protective mother. When I was a teen (32 now), there is no way I could have been MIA for 60 hours without anyone really noticing. If I asked or made plans to be at a friends house, she always made me call to check in that afternoon after school with either her or my dad. She even occasionally called during the evening or the next day to see how things were going, though I always thought it was more to check and see if I was still where I said I'd be. Having grown up that way, I just can't imagine the concept of parents not remembering the date of a two night sleep over and not calling when I didn't show up at home.  I mean, I'm not faulting your parents or saying they were bad parents. Just that it's hard for me to imagine it.  After this experience, did they become more over protective and kept closer tabs on you?

My parents had a lot of trust in me. I always went where I said I was going and was where I was supposed to be when I was supposed to be there. So I don't blame them for not following up on me. They of couse blamed themselves for not knowing that the two day sleep over was still a month away. Afterwards they didn't become more protective, but once the event was far enough in the past my dad would joke with me whenever I left the house and he would tell me to stay out of lockers.

That's nice. Saves a big chunk of the dignity what's left after the ordeal. When I was in middle school I fainted and while unconscious apparently vomited on myself. In the front row of an auditorium full of students. Ended up being 2-3 worst years of my life.

 Unfortunately for me he didn't need to get anything out of his locker that day because he had done most of his homework during study hall and already had what he needed to take home with him already.  I think the moral here is to procrastinate on your homework.

Amazing, horrifying story. Thanks for sharing! Did you hear about the guy in San Diego who was left in a holding cell for five days? Any thoughts on that?  
      Incarceration of Daniel Chong:     The incarceration of Daniel Chong was an incident in April 2012 in San Diego, California, when agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accidentally left a detainee locked in a holding room and forgot he was there. The cell contained no food, water or bathroom facilities.  Five days later when he was found, he had to be hospitalized for several days for a variety of medical problems. The incident touched off a national furor, resulting in several investigations and a $20 million claim filed against the DEA. The incident has been described as a "Kafkaesque nightmare,"  a "debacle," and "one of the worst cases of its kind."

 While locked up, he was starving and hallucinating. He claimed that, while incarcerated, he had to drink his own urine for hydration, and ingested some methamphetamine that he found under a blanket inside the cell in order to keep himself awake. He attempted suicide by breaking one of the lenses in his eyeglasses, slitting his wrists with the shards and swallowing them.  This was the first news story that I haven't been personally connected to that truly made my blood fucking boil.

Okay I think I've read all the questions so I hope I'm not re-asking anything here:  You said in a way you were glad it happened to you, a lot of people can look back on character-building experiences and actually miss them, even though it was awful at the time, do you miss the locker sometimes? Even in a weird small way? Did you feel closer to his locker after that? Do you wonder who has the locker right now and has no idea such an important life experience happened right there in their locker? I'm interested in the story from your parents'/boyfriend's perspective... I imagine it was hard to fall asleep Sunday night while you were missing? What was their reaction when you spoke to them for the first time? Did you tell your parents you loved them like you planned? Did anyone initially stifle a laughter at you when it was all said and done? Do you remember what kind of stuff you were into? Like any specific songs you had stuck in your head, or sang? Or intentional daydreams you had just for fun? Has the locker haunted / helped you in an explicit way since then? Obviously it was character building but anything more specific than that? Or maybe locker nightmares? Do you recommend this experience to anyone else? Haha! How (if at all) has it altered your ultimate perspective on death?  Sorry for all the questions, hope you see them! And thanks! Glad it wasn't worse and we're able to have this conversation!  
In my short life I've noticed that girls often endure difficult situations much easier than guys from a psychological point of view. Guys lose their shit if they aren't in control.  
That is because we have the babies and can endure more pain, lol. But I have heard that too, I wonder how much more difficult it would have been to tolerate being trapped in there if I were a guy.

I can't imagine that happening to me... How did you pass the time? 60 hours is surely not something you can nap through... Or even stay awake, doing nothing.

I did a lot of thinking when I was awake. And well, since I was already kind of exposed I passed some of the time enjoying myself, if you know what I mean. It was a horrible place to be so I figured I might as well experience some pleasure while in there. I didn't post about that at first because I didn't know if it was appropriate or not, but one user messaged me and asked me about it and said that it should be a problem.

Man, I don't blame you. Have to do something to pass the time! Also, just a random question, but what movement were you limited to in the locker?

Well I could bend my knees forward so they pressed on the door and then my butt pushed against the back wall and I'd lean my head on the door. That was my sleeping/resting position. The biggest restriction was my arms. They would get pinned in place at times and it was hard to move them to where I wanted them.

Sorry if this is really dumb, my high school didn't have lockers so im going off of basic gym lockers... but how did you pull the door closed after the lock was already through the hole? I'm not disbelieving your story at all! I'm just confused.

Well, the locker was a tall locker, I'd say about 6' tall or so. Under the shelf there was probably about 5 1/2' feet. So I could stand up in there without a problem. Both times when I close the locker I pulled the door quickly and pulled my arm inside the locker. The door then slammed shut latching in the process. I am not locker expert, so maybe the lockers you had were different, but ours could be close after a lock was put on it and if you closed it hard enough it would slam shut and latch.

Ugh, that's horrible, i couldn't imagine how shitty and scary that must have felt. Sad too, since that was actually a pretty cute idea (how you ended up in there to begin with)

Lol, a prank worse than me peeing all over the inside of his locker? No, he never topped that. If he had been the one to find me Monday morning I still intended to scare him. I mean after all I went through I should have still had my chance to get him.

This is absolutely terrifying, reminds me of this youtube video of the guy trapped in an elevator for 41 hours, I can't imagine adding 20 hours and being in a locker. You should sell your story to I Shouldn't Be Alive.

How small are you? I'm not that big of a kid either but my school's locker are probably a foot by a foot and I could barely fit in them still!

I am 5' 3" now as an adult, I was shorter when this happened when I was 17, I am not sure how much shorter though. I am thin so I think I could fit into a 1' x 1' space, but the locker was deeper than it was wide. It was probably wider than 12", maybe like 15" or 16", but I am not sure, I'm not great at judging sizes like that. But I did fit and when I faced the front my shoulders were squeezed in, it was easier for me to face the side of the locker.

How long did the relationship last after this? Have you ever met anyone that did the same thing? Have you ever been referred to as the hide and seek champion?   FYI, posts don't gain a lot of attention late in the evening US time.

We stayed together for about another year, this event didn't change anything between us. If anything he became more protective of me. I haven't heard of or met anyone else that this has happened to, I might be the only person. Or at least the only person who has told people about it. Lol, no, but that would be a rough way to win hide and seek. So do you suggest I repost this at some other time? Is that even allowed?

We were going away to different colleges. If was something that we had talked about for some time, that if we didn't feel a life long connection, that we would separate when it was time to go to college. I am glad we made that choice because I met my husband in college and wouldn't trade him for anything.

Well that's good to hear. I have a long distance relationship with my SO and she might be going to a 4-year university after community college that even further away. Plus, I'm not going to school.  I'm just wondering if doing something similar to you would benefit me.

You said you expected to die on Saturday night. To me, one of the most terrifying things to think about is what it would be like to know you were going to die in a short amount of time and that you could do nothing to prevent it. What was that like?

It was a horrible thought. I could imagine how sad my parents would be and the trama my boyfriend would experience finding me dead. They probably would never even figure out why I was locked inside my boyfriends locker and he might even have been blamed for my death. So I wasn't only concerned for myself, but for others as well.

They took me to the hospital in an ambulance. They re-hydrated me through an IV, gave me something to help me relax and to help with the pain. They got me out of my dirty clothes and cleaned me up. The check my whole body for bruises and cuts. My hands and feet hurt so they did an xray on them and they found my broken toe. I slept a lot while I was in the ER so they may have done other stuff while I slept. They decided to keep me overnight for observation just to make sure I was doing okay. I don't remember what they gave me to eat or drink, but most likely since it was a hospital it didn't taste very good.

Hi, sorry it took so long to reply to you, I don't come on here much at all. How do you know I have a daughter? Did I mention that in my post somewhere? It's been a long time since I wrote it so it may have slipped my mind. To answer your question, she thinks the story is a bit funny since I didn't really go into detail for her about how terrified I was, but she also realized on her own how scary it would be to be trapped and alone like that all weekend.

How did he react to the soiled locker?  
He was more worried about me than anything, but his locker wasn't that bad. I had only peed and my jeans had soaked up most of it. But the janitor was nice enough to clean the inside of his locker before he even got to school. In fact he didn't even know what had happened until a few hours into school when the principal called him to his office. He of course noticed his lock was missing, but didn't know what happened to it until the principal talked to him.

Hmm Good thing I have a habit of pinging my wife and kids every 4 hrs or less. I get paranoid and this story has me in anxious knots.  You are certainly very brave for staying a night in an empty school, in a dark hallway, locked inside a small locker. However can't say the idea to go into a locker was wise. Highschool is a time by which such actions and their risks should hold some gravity for teenagers.

I think that may have been the most scary, how alone I was. There was no other person in the building but me. Honestly, I think it may have been more scary to wander the dark hallways all night alone than to be trapped in a locker. At least it is a small space that feels secure instead of being in a big open area where creepy things could lurk in the shadows.

Hello! First of all I'm sorry about your experience, but I'm also happy that it didn't end up worse. You said that you expected to die. When you thought about it, did you have some thoughts like, you regretted doing/not doing something, doing something in your life differently. If so, did you later act upon these reflections? How much did you feel this finality of your life?

The thing I regretted most was the pain my death would cause people that I cared about. Besides that, I did want to finish high school, start college, get married and have kids. Those are things that I thought I was going to miss out on. I have now done each of those things. But that night I was almost sure that I wouldn't make it to the next day.

It was hard to explain to people. Writing it wasn't weird, but actually saying to someone that I had locked myself inside a locker felt weird. I was embarrassed, but only a few people ever knew what had happened. My family, some school employees, my boyfriend and only my best friend knew. Other than them, the rest of the kids at school just thought that I was out sick for the week. I didn't get in trouble, they figured I had been through enough, but I did have a lot of explaining to do. I was lectured by the principal and also had to talk to a police officer since they had been contacted.

How did it feel to walk after standing like that for so long?  Were you even able to being so dehydrated?  
I didn't walk, I didn't even try, when they opened the locker they helped me out and lowered me to the floor. The paramedics came and took me from there. I didn't walk until several hours later at the hospital. My legs were really sore for several days afterwards.

I can only imagine how sore they were.  Thanks for answering my question.

On behalf of Chuck Klosterman...  Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn anymore; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein? Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. Would you attempt to do this? Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. Which option do you select? You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Credence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a Capella (but it will only sound this way to you). Would you swallow the pill? At long last, someone invents "the dream VCR." This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR. Would you still do this? Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story? You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's "deeper philosophy." Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual? A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commercial success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likelihood of you reading this book? You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill. Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie? You meet a wizard. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, "I will now make them a dollar more attractive." He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. How much cash do you give the wizard? For reasons that cannot be explained, cats can suddenly read at a twelfth-grade level. They can't talk and they can't write, but they can read silently and understand the text. Many cats love this new skill, because they now have something to do all day while they lay around the house; however, a few cats become depressed, because reading forces them to realize the limitations of their existence (not to mention the utter frustration of being unable to express themselves). This being the case, do you think the average cat would enjoy Garfield, or would cats find this cartoon to be an insulting caricature? You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. The surgery is in two weeks. How do you spend the next fourteen days? You have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. Which option do you select? Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack? For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. Which film would you be most interested in seeing?  Edit: For those wondering, these questions are a subset of Chuck Klosterman's Hypertheticals. I'd have included more but Reddit only allows 10,000 characters per reply.

If this was me:   Yes he would be more impressive than Albert Einstein. I'd kick the shit out of that horse. What's the best body part to aim for when you're kicking a horse to death? I'd pick the turtle and do my best to keep it alive. I'd take the pill. I wouldn't do it. The capture of Nessie and Bigfoot. I watched the Dark Crystal in grade 6 and thought it was alright, I wouldn't have an issue with this person. It would decrease the likelihood of me reading it. I'll come to that conclusion by myself. My mom died last year, but in this hypothetical situation where she's alive I'd leave the theatre and go check on my mother. As much as I can spare. I think 70% wouldd find it really offensive and the other 30% would find it hilarious due to how completely wrong it is and they'd think that humans are dumb for coming up with that idea. I'd do everything I could to make life easier for my stupid self. I'd right an instruction manual on how to deal with things and other stuff like that.  While I'm not overly excited about either option, I'd choose a year in Europe. The public will be able to go to the moon soon enough. P.S: does stipend mean that I'd get paid $2000 every month?  I'd give them $200 and say that friend number 2 bet me $200 that I wouldn't do it. The Columbia Tri Star production to see what their take on my life is. I can ask my friends about what they said later.

Solid answers.  On #6, are you saying you'd combine the Nessie and Bigfoot stories into one? Clever. If you had to split the story, however, which one gets the top healine on the NYT? On #13, yes you'd get $2000/month

Since it's an American newspaper and many Americans have an obsession with Bigfoot I would put the story about it on the front page.

Yes. No. Hitler's Skull Yes. No. Loch Ness No. Decrease. Exit. $20 The latter. I would spend the two weeks studying brain surgery in order to develop an alternative surgical method that can remove my tumor while sparing my frontal lobe. I then teach it to the surgeons that are to operate on me. Done. Ten minutes on the moon is more than long enough to kill me. I'll take the former. If I kicked my friend in the ribcage as hard as I could, he'd probably die from internal bleeding. I must therefore be going mad. I don't kick him. The latter.

Your worst fear is becoming immortal?  I think this bears explaning  
The elves in Tolkien's world saw the mortality of men as a gift from Ilúvatar. Immortality would mean a stronger connection to the world you live in and the harm done to it, as well as, as I think Tolkien himself put it, not being able to see the beauty in the small things in life.

I only remember a few things.  It involved me playing a chess game against the guy with a mask. The guy was a serial killer, and I was his latest victim. If I lost the chess game, he would kill me, if I won, he would make me kill him. There was constantly scary music playing. Like genuinely terrifying. Since this was a dream, I didn't question where it was coming from. He kept giggling quietly the whole time. I won. He took off his mask. He was me. I woke up screaming. I was 12 at the time.

My boyfriend doesn't want to come to my family's house for Christmas. Even though he has a good reason (his car has issues) and we've only been dating about a month, it still hurts my feeling.

Yeah.  And coming to a family gathering can feel like a big commitment step for a lot of people.  If you get too involved with someone's family too early and then things don't work out...you'd feel like you were letting a lot more people down. I personally wouldn't confront a boyfriend of one month about it.  I wouldn't air any irrational feelings to a boyfriend of one month. You know, over time, people get to know that you're a rational person (if you are).  Before they know that for sure, it can really spook them.

Hmm. If his car is the only thing holding him back, then suggest that he take the bus or a taxi. If he continues to make excuses, then confront him. That's my two cents.

Do you know what would have happened if same-sex twins had fused in the womb?  Would there have been any way to know?    
I have a friend who fused with her identical twin. While I assume this can also happen without any adverse issues,  she wound up two sets of fully functional reproductive systems. She had a hysterectomy to remove one of the sets because she said their menstrual cycles weren’t synced up so she was almost constantly pmsing and bleeding (among other complications). She’s fine now.

Holy crap, I knew someone who bled for a month straight because of some weird hormonal glitch... she got anemia from it and had to be hospitalized. How did your friend deal with this  
Do you know what would have happened if same-sex twins had fused in the womb?  Would there have been any way to know?    
Probably no way to know until it was discovered, somehow. Unless it causes them a medical issue, people might never know.  
They didn’t know until at puberty I had painful abdominal bloating and swelling. I’m basically what happens when opposite sex twins fuse in the womb.  
So presumably you're free to commit all sorts of terrible crimes since DNA evidence will be useless!

I don’t have a vagina, so they found out I was intersex from the massive, painful bloating of my abdomen. They put me under anesthesia and drained it through a tube near my navel.

No hysterectomy. Parents were stingy. So it was a one time treatment chunk of time when it was discovered.

Do you have any advice for parents of intersex children? What do you wish people knew about being intersex, and how would you change cultural perception of intersex people if you could?  
Do you have any advice for parents of intersex children? What do you wish people knew about being intersex, and how would you change cultural perception of intersex people if you could?  
I would say be as honest as possible. Sorta like adoption (I’m also adopted.) Don’t pressure them to be one gender role over the other. Encourage them to have whatever interests they want, regardless of gender stereotyping. I wish people knew we exist and have normal, healthy lives. People seem to act like we’re mole people who hide in the shadows ready to eat young children. Also, that each one of us have different situations, organs, interests, and self-expressions, so one size probably doesn’t fit all.

Too cute!  
He’s a big teddy bear, but he’s had to hold his own in fights throughout his life because people think he wants to fight because of his genetics and his mean looking face. (He has resting angry face.) He also did MMA for a few years and does powerlifting. He’s scary strong. Stronger than people heavier than himself. Edit: he’s actually not flexing. His arms are really big and jacked. They get crazier when he has a pump. Cartoonishly big.  
Your description and the partial image matches this guy soo much: Jujimufu  https://www.youtube.com/user/trickstutorials Anyway, good luck in your transition. My gf is bi but also has been really instrumental in my education in people who aren't straight or non gender confirming

What are difficulties you've faced throughout school and on?  
What are difficulties you've faced throughout school and on?  
I didn’t really face much trouble, other than being small and feminine. I was popular because I let people cheat off of me, so I wasn’t picked on, and several times, older kids thought I was cool / funny, so I got in with popular kids from upper grades. But I was in several religious situations because of my parents, none turned out very well. Lots of abuse. But in school settings, no problems, other than identity issues. I knew I always liked guys, but could tell that was frowned upon, so I kept those details to myself as long as I could. Except in high school, I was rebellious. Loud gay person who rejected the notions that were brought up about anything other than conservative sexuality and even intersex people. There was a priest / teacher who I always resented because he said for intersex people that, “they cut it off.” I was livid.  
No interest in having a synthetic vagina. I have an, “add on, not permanently remove” mentality when it comes to my body modifications. The cramps felt about the same as getting hit in the balls...but consistent, versus a traumatic burst of pain. Getting slapped in the boobs (Edit: directly on the nipples) feels just like getting hit in the balls.  
 Getting slapped in the boobs feels just like getting hit in the balls.  I'm honestly surprised by that since I've never keeled over from taking a hit to my breasts but I've seen guys drop from taking a hit to the balls many times. If you start menstruating internally again, then what? Do you just keep draining it?  The cramps felt about the same as getting hit in the balls...but consistent, versus a traumatic burst of pain.  If you ever had the pleasure of getting an IUD you'd find that your consistent cramps get turned into random traumatic bursts of pain instead. Much fun.

So I’m talking directly on the nipples. Unless it’s only that painful when they’re growing. I guess if I start menstruating again, I’ll see what treatment I can get, but I don’t know if that will happen.

I think it might be related to them growing. I am currently lactating, so my boobs are changing constantly and getting kicked in the nipple by my infant has almost dropped me. I've never experienced anything like that before.

I doubled over in pain from a hit directly to the breasts once, I was about 11 or 12 at the time so perhaps they were more sensitive then.

Eh, I wouldn't say entirely answered, because cramping pains vastly differ between people with periods. Plus, iirc, OP has endometriosis, which will add an entirely new dimension of pain to someone's period. I don't envy it.

Are you considering bottom surgery at some point and if so, what would that mean with your anatomy? Would they be able to connect your vagina to your uterus? I’d imagine that would become more of a priority if your period comes back.  (You don’t have to answer if you don’t want, and I do realize that not all trans people want/need surgery. I’m interested in the logistical side.) Thanks for doing this AMA!

I don’t have any interest in getting bottom surgery. I know it will never be a real vagina, and I don’t have horrific dysphoria about my genitalia. I identify with both parts of myself, but prefer to be classified as feminine (by societal standards.)

So would you have been able to make yoursef pregnant? I guess it would genetically be like brother and sister getting a child together, so not really a clone. I mostly used that word because you would make a child only out of your "own" DNA (even though you have two)  
I don’t know how well they function, but they might have been kickstarted by my HRT. I loooooove kids. I used to cry over not being able to give birth. Wanted to be a mother instead of a father before I understood how it all worked. I’ve always wanted 2 boys and a girl, all adopted (I was adopted). Girl in the middle, in case that comes up. It’s just not financially feasible to have so many kids in this economic climate, but still more socially responsible than giving birth, right now (with all the unadopted kids in the world.)  
Fostering may be a bridge to your dream.  Prob varies by state, but foster parents get gov’t assistance (some scammers use fostering as their means of support, to the detriment of the children).  Same goes for adoption of foster kids.  Something to think about, perhaps?

I asked this on a trans or lgbt subreddit one time on a throwaway, if being attracted to feminine trans women but also being sexually attracted to dick on women was fetishizing them, and they absolutely blew up at me. They couldnt understand that I am attracted to and have dated and would possibly marry a Cis woman, or passing trans woman. Like, im sexually attracted to male parts, but only if they are attached to a very feminine person, but I still see them as women, and would date a trans woman with no problem. They claimed I fetishized them, and it's difficult to explain i think? What do you think? Ive dated a trans woman before, and it wasnt for sex, she was a wonderful gal. I just like dick AND vagina on girls, i guess?

I think many transwomen are sensitive to being fetishized because we aren’t treated very well. Most guys who are into us want to go back to their regular ciswomen programming when they want to settle down or have an actual relationship. I, personally, would only want to be with cismen who are specifically attracted to transwomen. I’d rather be a fetish than an experiment. But I’m Asian, so I’m very, VERY used to being fetishized or marginalized.

Fellow Endosister here. I about cried when I read that you had it, I can't imagine how painful and scary that must have been for you, both physically and mentally. Did the doctors happen to say if your Endo developed because of a lack of outlet for the menstrual blood/tissues or was it idiopathic like most women?

I’ll never understand people who are discriminatory or hateful towards trans people in general, but especially intersex people.

Have all of your romantic partners been as understanding? That’s highly personal and I’m in no way entitled to an answer. But I was curious about it.  Thank you for the CasualAMA!

It has been an issue in past relationships because I was a feminine man which is arguably the least desirable gender-sex combination in society, so many partners treated me like they were doing me a favor. Most romantic partners did not know, because I haven’t felt comfortable enough to share it with people when I’m trying to fit into a masculine box. No problem about the AMA!

Oh gosh, I’m so sorry people have treated you that way. You seem like an amazing person and they should’ve felt honored to know you instead of treating you like a pity project. That’s narcissistic of them at best. I can see how it would be much easier to hide as well, being that your female parts are internal, though I’m sorry again that you have had to hide anything at all. I hope that you’re now able to completely be yourself and I’m so glad that you’re able to transition into the beautiful woman you were meant to be! Yours is not an easy road to travel, but it seems as though you’ve handled it with grace and class. Go you!  On a side note: stories like yours just drive home for me that my daughter, who is lesbian, will have a tough road but should always hold her head high, and that we should give her all of the love, support, and acceptance that is humanly possible. We have a very laid back household and I’ve raised both of my kids to just be who they are, and love who they love. Regardless of gender, race, religion, family status, etc... Whether they conform to societal norms or not. When she first acted like she was interested in girls, (I had pretty much figured it out already) I made it clear to her that we don’t care who she loves, so long as she’s happy and they’re good to her. She’s 15 now, an amazing young lady, and has a wonderful girlfriend of her own. We’re so proud of her for being who she is meant to be without letting anyone make her into someone she is not. My son is straight so far as we know, but he has always been told the same. I never could imagine being the kind of mother who could distance themselves from their child over something like gender choice or sexual orientation.

You don't have to answer if you aren't comfortable, but you mentioned you have both testicles and ovaries, so does that mean you have both sperm and eggs? If so, are they both viable for conception (as in would you be able to use either your sperm to fertilize a donor egg or have your eggs fertilized with donor sperm)?

If so, are they both viable for conception (as in would you be able to use either your sperm to fertilize a donor egg or have your eggs fertilized with donor sperm)?   
I have both, yes. But I don’t think my eggs would be viable after so long, and my sperm is probably infertile due to HRT.

Eggs are stored in an immature form until the ovaries are ready to release them (usually one each month). They do start degrading but they are generally just as viable as ever until your late 30's.  Most people trying to get pregnant after 45 end up using donor eggs but before that it depends on the person.

You have to remember that you are speaking about ciswomen who haven’t had medical procedures to destroy their female sex organs, though.

A lot of questions here are focusing on your sexuality, but I'm curious about the two sets of DNA. Forgive me if I don't word this right, I'm not quite sure that our language is equipped to fully portray my question Consciousness. We are essentially self aware dna living in a meat bag. Since you're composed of essentially two people biologically, so you ever feel like there's a second set if wants or needs in your head with you?  Not like having multiple personalities or anything negative  But if you have two twins (especially fraternal) they're going to have different wants needs and thoughts. Since technically both of you are in you, I'm curious if there's ever a conflict or discussion or if the two "sides" even exist at all Thanks for the ama by the way! I had no idea that something this awesome was even possible, and I'm glad that you've been able to adapt and enjoy a life so rare!

Biologically, people who are chimeras still have one brain. It's just that its development was influenced by both sets of genes, be they both XX, or one XX and one XY (haven't heard of a double XY chimera so I'm not sure if it's possible). This is different than conjoined twins, who have two brains, and sometimes overlapping nervous and circulatory systems. That would be where people may potentially share consciousness.

I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate, are you aware of any chimeras who are not conjoined twins, who have reported seperate consciousness? I'd love to read more if there's something out there, or even a conjoined twin case that you've found interesting

A chimera, by definition, can't be a conjoined twin. Conjoined twins have the same DNA; a chimera has two different sets of DNA.

I’m lucky enough to never have had pronoun problems because I’m really feminine. I’m also not very sensitive: I curse like a sailor and I troll my boyfriend in a constant stream of teasing and stupid puns. As long as you try, I don’t see how anyone should get upset. Just remember that a lot of us trans folk have had really, really bad experiences, so that may make most more sensitive.

Just remember that a lot of us trans folk have had really, really bad experiences, so that may make most more sensitive.  
I fuck with my boyfriend all the time, we go back and forth with puns. He also does a lot of dad jokes even though our child is a furry asshole of a cat. Some of my favorite puns I use to fuck with my boyfriend: Assault: This one I think anybody could do. Get a bottle or box of salt. Start taping or gently hitting him with it, of course don’t cause harm or pain but enough he noticed it’s happening. When he asks “what the fuck are you doing” reply that “I’m a-salt-ing you” Bonus: my boyfriend one time said “if you want I’ll show you assault” (joking of course) so I said “ok” and took a single grain of salt out of the box and went back to him and said “here honey you wanted to show me what assault really looks like so here’s a piece of a salt” Red Bull: I was going to the store to get some groceries and he asked me to get him a Red Bull. He told me “don’t come back with a live bull and paint it red because I know that’s something you would do it you could” so I said ok. When I came back I said “honey I got you a 4 pack of Red Bull’s I hope you don’t mind” And he turned around and I was holding a 4 pack of red  food storage bowls, since I couldn’t find any plastic red bowls at our local dollar store. Sunday: our cats name is Sundaee, she came with the name and I wanted to change it but never did. So whenever he says something like “hey do you want to go to the movies on Sunday?” I usually reply “sure, but I think the cat is too small for us to ride her like a horse.” or any variation of an activity he mentions doing on Sunday. It’s gotten to the point that he refers to Sunday as “the day after Saturday” My favorite one that I did and from early on in our relationship is the Apple Watch. My boyfriend really wanted one, but I couldn’t afford it. So I found a kids apple shaped watch on amazon and gave it to him for our 1 year anniversary. He thought it was hilarious. I got him some other stuff that day but I don’t even remember what is was lol. Here’s the watch: https://imgur.com/gallery/gVdRzbE Edit: I just remembered one that my boyfriend did to me, I think it was after one of my “asalts” he grabbed a receipt out of the shopping and held it against my upper chest. I asked him “what are you doing” and he said “oh I’m just pressing charges against you”

From a medical standpoint, I am just wondering how is the internal arrangement of your organs. Does it get "crowded" on your insides? Is there also a vestigial clit involved? Nature is bloody wonderful. Also, what about the stuff that very clearly falls on either the male or female side (dimorphic traits, genetically speaking)? I know you answered about boobs and beard and voicebox, but what about the subtler things, like say, pelvis shape - is it wide like a woman or narrow like man? Could your mammaries lactate, given you're under a barrage of female hormones? What about lung capacity/nostril size? And what about genetic susceptibility to diseases because there are a variety of diseases and disorders that selectively affect men/women over the other gender? And if it's a mixed bag, did you end up getting best of both deals or the worst?

I can’t tell about any organ crowding. I suspect most people can’t really tell, unless it’s horrible. My penis is what would be a vestigial clit. Erectile tissue develops into either a clit or a penis. My boyfriend says my hips are wider than most ciswomen he’s dated. I lactate (boyfriend loves it.) My lung capacity is reaaaaally big. I played the saxophone. My nose looks just like an Asian nose. I have a few genetic abnormalities. Marfan Syndrome being one. I’m more susceptible to a lot of cancers, simply due to HRT. My bones are lighter, but apparently harder than most people. I guess I’m a bird? I don’t really know of other conditions that I’m susceptible to due to my chimerism.

They were squished above my bladder (somewhat behind it), but I’m assuming that they’ve shrunk and made accommodations in size for other organs. I don’t have the exact pictures from the x-rays and MRIs. There was an attachment to a wall, I remember being told, because they had to explain to my parents that I have unique options for surgery.

So DNA tests to track your heritage are all the rage right now. If you took two, what are the chances that they would have the same outcome?

Thanks so much for your AMA!  
They would have the same heritage. Twins still have the same mom and dad. Your heritage should be the same, the markers that they test for just might not be included in what testing places look for. The variances would be different in terms of expression (skin, hair color, etc.) I don’t want my DNA to be tested because of information being given to parties that I don’t personally authorize.

There would likely be some variances though, as people don’t inherit exactly 50/50 DNA from their parents. If one parent was fully Japanese for example, it would be normal for one child to test 49% Japanese and another to test 51% Japanese. So only slightly different, but still. One set could even have a .1% trace of some ancestor way way back that the other set doesn’t.

They did not like it. My parents are super conservative and were in a religious cult for a number of years while I was growing up. They actually did weird religious rituals to “cleanse me” after they found out I had extra organs. I can grow facial hair, but it’s slow growing and sparse. Even before HRT. I plan to get electrolysis to get rid of that problem. I’m Asian, so... Reddit isn’t so bad. Anonymity is part of the deal.

I couldn’t agree more. I too am reading everything. I have always wondered about this kind of situation.  Prayerfully, in the future there will be ways to tell/predict things like this at birth, etc.,. What I mean is like proper genetic gender testing being common that could also predict changes down the road. Technology has come so far that I believe this is possible. Just the fact that DNA testing has become a popular Christmas gift kind of blows my mind!

Really interesting AMA! Thanks for posting. In your OP you state that your parents wanted a boy. How do they feel about your preference for beung a girl? You said you found out when you were a teen, did you agree with your parents at the time to 'become/stay a boy'? And what was the doctor like, was he/she supportive in guiding you to your decision? I appreciate these questions are very personal. Feel free to tell me I'm too nosy.

They did everything they could to steer me away from feminine expression. It was also very frowned upon in things like Boy Scouts, and adults would straight up mock me. My parents made the decision without me, and I wasn’t very happy about it. As a minor, my input was ignored by medical professionals.

Probably the most interesting AMA I’ve seen here. Thank you so much for doing this.  What are your thoughts on gender dysmorphia in general? It’s something I myself struggle to understand but I feel like everything you’ve experienced makes absolute sense.  When you meet trans people that don’t have an identifiable genetic/biological conflict (?) with gender, do you feel like there’s any difference between them and yourself? Is gender dysmorphia honestly something that society should just accept without question? I swear I don’t have a set position on the matter. This is something I’m truly curious about and seems super conflicting to me whenever it comes up.  Thanks!

When you meet trans people that don’t have an identifiable genetic/biological conflict (?) with gender, do you feel like there’s any difference between them and yourself? Is gender dysmorphia honestly something that society should just accept without question? I swear I don’t have a set position on the matter. This is something I’m truly curious about and seems super conflicting to me whenever it comes up.  Thanks!   
You’re welcome! I didn’t really think this would blow up. I don’t think I’ve met another trans person in real life and talked about their struggles. It’s not like we have quarterly progress reports or anything. I feel like I’m more chill and less sensitive than most, but that’s purely anecdotal. I think that gender dysphoria is different for each case. Some who claim to have it might actually just have a fetish. Some just need counseling to figure it out. Some, like me, just know and go about our lives. Some, it causes immense pain. I think society should be aware that it’s something real, but not insistent that it has clear cut and dry clinical signs, symptoms, and treatments. The best way to describe it is like coming from a family that has just been...coal miners their entire life. Their father’s father’s father’s father...etc. have always been that...but they want to become an artist. The family frowns upon it. It’s kinda like that, but with being born with parts that don’t feel right or something feels missing. I see it as no different from people’s diverse preferences of attraction, hobbies, favorite foods, etc. Shouldn’t just like something just because it’s what’s expected of you by...society. As long as they’re not physically harming another person, it’s no one else’s business.

Earlier in your post you mentioned being adopted. Have you ever considered trying to find/contact your biological parents or other relatives? I know you were not fond of DNA testing but didn't know if you considered other methods? (Fellow adoptee here )

 Parents wanted a boy, so they drained it and nuked me with steroid medications. Not sure what, exactly , I was barely a teen.   That’s an injustice. It’s not fair for them to decide for you.

What do you think of the relatively recent "wave" of people identifying as trans? Do you think it's helped or hurt public perception and awareness? Also, do you happen to know the medical odds of this happening? Simply curious on that one.

Like everything, it’s situational. Having different race friends back during segregation was seen as being controversial. And resistance was mainstream. My opinion on trans publicity is the same with gay publicity. There are both good and bad examples. It’s also been something that has been around for thousands of years, so it’s way less new than people think. Plenty of countries and cultures around the world have mainstream trans people (Brazil, Iran, etc.) but a lot of Americans forget that there’s an entire world out there, even though we dominate the social media world. No idea on the medical odds. Probably more common than people know, due to some people not having any real sign of “you have multiple DNA sets!” until it’s an issue. But probably super rare because of the specific circumstances required. Some stillborn babies might be similar to me, for example, and I just might’ve slid under the radar for whatever reason.

I'm trans too (female to male), and I don't really think it's a "wave". It's just safer to be trans now. There's more visibility, awareness, and protection.

MtF here (2mo HRT)! You lucky fucker. Tanner stage 4 after 6 months HRT. Some trans people never get tanner stage 4. Can you tell me more about your transition? (How you knew you were trans, how it affects your body differently, what the doctors and procedure of getting hrt was like as an intersection person ?)

Well, I always felt feminine. My condition validated that. I haven’t really noticed any changes, it’s all boyfriend input. He says he seems to be more into my body smell. Obvious breast growth. My skin was already smooth and hairless, my boyfriend says my legs and butt are “very soft and feminine and filling out nicely and have wider hips than most girls that [he’s] been with.” He says my muscle tone has plummeted and that I’ve drastically changed. I don’t really imagine it’s much different than what regular MtF girls go through. My care has been great! I go to APLA, and they are very good toward trans patients.

Assuming you are male. If you were drugged, (unconscious) then given drugs to ensure an erection. You wake up to your naked drugged mother in front of you and you are partially inserted. Your father has also been drugged similarly and is partially inserted into you. The only way to escape is to fully insert yourself into your mother, which will remove your father from your anus and allowing you to twist away. Or you can back into your father, removing yourself from your mother and then twisting away.  Which escape would you prefer?

This has been making me think a lot about books and articles from decades ago or even centuries ago where the authors thought that due to automation, by now we’d be working like 15 hours a week while robots did the rest, leaving us to enjoy the pleasures of life. I guess those people assumed we’d still make the same wages, or perhaps inflation wouldn’t be a thing. Whoops.

Don't get it wrong, we are indeed making more profit for less work (at least in industry) but the higher ups are the ones that pocket all that surplus. Isn't it why we have so many billionaires today?

That's definitely something to be mad about. When profits rise so much but the salaries barely keep up with inflation (if they do) then you know something's wrong

Don't even look at minimum wage. Look at median household income. The increases in median household income has not kept up with inflation. The buying power for those right in the middle is diminishing year after year.  Minimum wage workers are fucked. That's a given and that needs to be fixed. But things are getting worse for so many more, too. We need to do something that helps everybody in the bottom 97%.

But things are getting worse for so many more, too. We need to do something that helps everybody in the bottom 97%.  
Additionally, If median income went up significantly, wages at the bottom would too, right? As an owner of a small business with clients squarely in the middle class i would love to offer jobs that could truly support someone. As it is now, we find it very hard to truly pay a liveable wage.

But things are getting worse for so many more, too. We need to do something that helps everybody in the bottom 97%.  
But you can’t tell that to half these people in the 97%. We can’t expand Medicaid because they don’t want anybody getting something for free when it would be them seeing the benefits. You can’t raise taxes on the wealthy because somehow they can’t comprehend how far they are from wealthy, and never will be close. They hate the ACA because their premiums went up but their old insurance would have dropped them the minute they got sick. They really have their pride tied up in the fact that they’re doing better than somebody and they’ll die trying to hang on to the illusion that they’re somewhere near the top. It’s sad as hell.

Yup, and it’s why billionaireity, as a concept, should not exist.

They assumed we would get paid for our work, and not for the time we spend at work. An interesting take on it is Bullshit Jobs, which says that we are made to work 40+ hours a week because employers want to get 'their money's worth'.

I'm a teacher in a school where all the students have been sent home. We are still required to show up for our contracted hours. Today during a meeting our superintendent was talking about how we'd have to keep finding work for hourly employees to do so we could keep paying them. We aren't a restuarant  or a store that's shutdown and not making money. The budget is already setup. But we need to run through the motions since we couldnt possibly just pay these people anyway.

It has nothing to do with inflation. It has to do with creating artificial demand for useless stuff (and also creating useless jobs) so that more people work so that the system can continue working and generating profit. We really don't need to work nearly as much as we do.

Yeah, I think that’s what some of those old predictions were getting at. Work would be something like the community going “Oh shit, the levee’s breaking, cmon lads, let’s go fill sandbags and then drink a few rounds afterwards to unwind!” (Though I guess the robots could do that too 😂) Instead if I wanted to fill sandbags I’d have to take work off from my real job (if bossman says yes).

Worst thing is that for that to become a reality we just need a slight change in things, not need for a crazy revolution.  But some dickheads in Wall Street think a billion dollars is not enough.

You might not think of it as a revolution but because those dickheads will feel threatened and they own the media, they will frame you as a revolutionary no matter what if this is your message and it becomes popular. That’s why Bernie decided to own it.

We can do this now.  The problem is were reliant on an economy that is producing far more than just basic living.

Well productivity per capita has skyrocketed with the Advent of computers and the internet, but that productivity has not been reflected in wage growth. The additional wealth produced by each worker has been consolidated in the hands of the wealthy. There are a ton of really good labor economics studies on this. Without redistributive legislation, the additional productivity of the worker will always be hoarded by whoever owns the capital.

Honestly, if I were laid off (and I'm the primary breadwinner), my stress level would initially be high, but then... a world of possibility. I would not be interested in pursuing new work in the same soul-sucking industry I'm in now, that's for sure.  
Are you looking for alternative work atm? I hope you find something that isn't so soul sucking

I'm working on creative endeavors, so hopefully! I have looked for alternative work but cannot find comparable salary elsewhere.

Yeah I’ve noticed this too. Although there’s stress and panic. People have also found time to fall back in love with their hobbies.

I’ve used the first days of this time to do everything I said I wanted to get done but never had time for - clean my room, go through papers, exercise, etc.. It has been nice.

Yeah we’ve got a puppy at the moment. I did not like him. My girlfriend already worked from home so she spent all day juggling work and looking after him. Then I’d come home after 9hrs of a stressful management position plus commuting and I’d have to take over from her so wouldn’t get a single second break from 6:30am to 11pm.  I self isolated last Weds and it’s been awesome to spend time with my girlfriend and puppy. The work all still gets done too.  10/10 would coronavirus again.  If it only it wasn’t for this whole pesky economic depression thing...and the fact I’ll lose my job and might die.

Thanks. Felt quite guilty as he’s lovey and cute and typical behaviours of a puppy. But selfishly couldn’t see past the fact that my entire social life/hobbies/exercise ground to a halt.  Now all that shit has ground to halt anyway and it’s not his fault this time, haha.

Had to check and see if you were my boyfriends alt account, we're in the same boat. Got a puppy early Jan, he bonded with me a lot more since I was home every day. Since the outbreak and my partner being able to WFH they've both become a lot happier and confident with each other, he says even though he still has to work he looks forward to knowing that he can spend his lunch break taking the dog to walk by the river. Also being able to work in your pyjamas and have endless cups of tea and coffee without worrying about Jan from finance stealing your milk is a big plus.

I think a lot of people don’t realize how much of their day is wasted by their commute to and from work. Everyone in my neighborhood seems to be way happier working from home

So many businesses will die during this pandemic, but I’m guessing many will sprout after it’s all over. I would bet on Etsy just blowing up with new sellers. Edit- why are people so butthurt over me speculating that people will sell things they make online?

Etsy is such shit to its sellers now honestly. They’ve never been great but they’ve really gone downhill lately. If someone on there sells another place I usually message them to ask which platform they prefer my purchase on. No one has preferred Etsy so far!  
Red bubble and society6. All you have to do is make the art and they'll produce and distribute the prints  
I love RedBubble. I had to deck out a new office last year, and bought an armload of random stickers and stuff from there. All top quality, all different art styles. They're great from a purchasing standpoint, too.

Etsy recently started putting advertisments everywhere. If you click through them, a fraction of every purchase you make over the next couple of weeks goes to etsy.

Going to be a lot of businesses that are "born"/"make-it" DURING this time, not just after it is over. I am in the legal cannabis industry in California, and we are deemed "essential personal" by our state. I think we are going to see some brands and delivery services experience huge growth during this lockdown and it will accelerate their companies further than would have been possible without "shelter in place" orders.

I have always wanted a battlestation. I have the led-infused computer. I have the liquid cooling with more LEDS. I have the RBG mechanical keyboard. I have the mouse that can sync rbg with my keyboard and the drivers set up.  I'm just... always moving on to the next project or working on stuff for work.  Today, I finally cable managed and set up my average battlestation. I also ordered about 100 bucks in cable ties, velcro patches, 12x12 baskets, headphone mounts, cable conduits, and a gaming mat

I don't get how people are so resistant to the idea that work sucks. It's either a coping mechanism, or they literally can't think of ways to live life other than working for someone else.

Agreed. Even if they have their "dream jobs" you can't tell me they don't still have days they'd rather not have to go. Like yeah they may love being a medical engineer but when it's pouring rain outside or when a game they've been anticipating is finally released that day I bet staying at home suddenly starts looking pretty good. ​ Me I'd do freelance art commissions if I never 'had" to work again purely out of hobby and interest and to get my name out there. But I'd be spending way more time doing other shit I also like if I never needed to work. I have too many hobbies and interests to really get a chance to get too tired of either one.

I think a few things will come of this, the first being that people will realize a lot of things in their life that they have but just don't interact with or, because they're required to slow down, they'll realize what they don't like about what they're doing. I also think a lot of people may start to explore hobbies since they can't just go out and get drunk every night and party and this will change the way a lot of people spend too. Our economy and culture has been centered around instant gratification for so long that people have forgotten to find things that are meaningful instead of just "fun" and I think having to slow down for a bit is going to definitely be a good thing in the long run.

Great choice, I haven't read the Narnia Chronicles in a while. I'm re-reading Ian Banks. He writes Space Opera, and it takes me a few readings to really appreciate the story and his writing style.

In the 3 days that I have worked part-time, I notice that I do not need to rush.    Monday I was walking the dog and rushing through it, as usual, when I remembered there was no place I had to rush off to.   I still keep rushing through laundry, taking a shower, everything.

I’m with you. I was rushing through eating today because I’m always on my way to something and eating is just an inconvenient necessity. I noticed I was powering through lunch and then I just... slowed down. Was nice.

Yeppp. I work in one of those superstores (EU), and there has been an endless stream of people coming in, for a good week now; wearing gloves and masks and what not, YET bringing their kids, or older people wandering around, and the hoarders, everything you can imagine.  At this point I just accepted that I'll get sick eventually, if am not already without me knowing it. Also, due to people buying up everything, some of us have to work extra hours. So, if I can be honest, I'm not even remotely happy, or relaxed.

Thank you so much for your hard work. Grocery stores are an essential service and we all really need you right now! It's a shame about all the hoarding that is going on though. I too am working in an essential service and I know it's tough right now. :(

The main thing coronavirus has taught me is, how disgustingly selfish, we as a society have become.  If this was a test to see how we'd fair in a nuclear holocaust, we have failed miserably.  People bulk buying toilet paper? Why?? There isnt a shortage. And it's never been said there will be.  Having fights because someone has a packet you think you need? Grow up you vile person.  Now its tins. Doesnt matter the contents either. Someone is probably sitting there with 200 tins of peach slices.  For no other reason than they think they MIGHT need some in a few weeks. When was the last time you ate some??  All the local supermarket companies have said there is no need to panic buy, that their supplies are not running low or even that there will be a problem with supply.  Why then, does it look like a plague of locusts have swarmed through every aisle of every shop? Because people are selfish.  Now, even though the Prime minister has told everyone to not go to pubs, clubs and restaurants, I see exactly that.  Lots genuinely believe it isnt going to affect them, and will be the first to cry when it does.  I was a cynic initially, but this whole scenario is so weird and surreal, I can't risk being cynical because of my children.

Today I went to the grocery store and this lady was piling up ~7 cartons of eggs in her basket. It made me really sad. I don't need eggs right now, I just got a carton yesterday, but this was at 9am. How many people will be able to go shopping after 5 because their jobs won't allow for remote work? How many of them need eggs, a staple food and a cheap source of protein? Will they still be able to buy them or will they run out well before then? How long will it take this lady to eat 72 84 eggs? Will she do it before they go bad or is this going to be wasted food for no reason? I actually gave her a thumbs down and walked away.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around it too. Do people think their caloric needs will triple because of quarantine? Milk, eggs, etc go bad relatively quickly!

The only change I’ve made is buying a little extra than I usually would so I can make 1 less trip to the store. And buying some yeast so I can make homemade bread. Probably unnecessary but just in case someone else wants to buy that loaf of store bread it’s there and I’ll have a nice homemade loaf. Doubt there is a rush on yeast.

Same, except food for my pets. I just bought one extra thing for my frog which can be stored in the freezer. It’s just extra source of protein/calories along with the usual worms. I’m surprised people actually finished off the other food items(for reptiles/amphibians). The worms were left. If they wanted they could make a worm farm and they’ll have a stock for the rest of their lives. But they were left.  Otherwise, business as usual. I don’t understand the phenomenon of buying in bulk. Apparently it’s a mindset of “trying to control whatever little you can” but that’s a head trip. Isn’t buying in bulk just proof that you’ve lost self control and reasoning?

Maybe. My speculation about toilet paper is that a bunch of people who usually poop at work just realized they're going to have to do it at home for the foreseeable future.  And multiply that by the number of people living in the house. You could speculate something similar about food.  Going from eating every meal away from home to every meal at home it could be easy to overestimate what you need. The tragedy of the commons works at almost every scale.

That is a good point. I was discussing this with a friend and maybe I am underestimating how many people eat out and are now forced to make most, if not all, of their meals at home now. I probably only eat out once a week. All my other meals I make myself.

The other day my mom was on a budget for breakfast to feed my siblings, and had made a list of things she could buy, basic things like eggs and bacon, that’s it. The shelves at every store were completely empty. It’s ridiculous.

The only logic I can think is that they are trying to avoid a return trip to the store.  If you have a family of 4 or more, its not uncommon to go to a grocery store and see someone with a huge cart full of foods and they go every week or something along those lines.  Now people are trying to buy what they normally would for multiple trips rather than going constantly, because people don't know if they'll be able to go out next week or not. 7 cartons of eggs is way different than the people who are buying multiple palates of toilet paper.  If anything, it shows that when people have no way to predict the near future or any real societal change it leads to people panicking.  The instructions provided have been completely botched.

I feel the opposite. This whole thing has made me realize how beneficial going to work every day is for my mental well being.

Agreed. I've been working remotely the past week and it's really made me realise just how much I need all the small social interactions that I usually get in the office

Same. All I’ve been thinking is that I’m gonna feel useless for at least a month. Video games are fun but when all you can do is sit at home and earn nothing it stresses me out.

You're just realizing this now? I've known this my whole life, no I've felt it in my soul. It makes integrating into the usual work-life incredibly difficult for me.  People around me are asking for overtime and I can barely string together the will for 40hrs.

Yeah, overtime has never in my life been worth the money, and whenever I decline working late I just think on my drive home "Man I'd honestly pay to NOT work late if overtime was mandatory" I always clock out basically the second my 8 hours are up and I've had people point it out or say if I clock out a minute past normal "Ahh Seacrux, heading out late today huh? haha what are you in such a hurry for?" I'm in a hurry to go back to fucking reality instead of slowly having the life sucked out of me any longer than possible.

I am 38 and have been working for 15 years, this is me 100%.

Normal life after coronavirus will feel weird

I was so stressed about work. I felt like I was teaching full time and getting paid part time. I had very little time to see my family or focus on myself. I was laid off last week and I was really worried at first. But since then I’ve been staying afloat and really hanging out with my family again. It feels nice. My stress levels are a ton lower now. I’m considering a career change.

I can see that. I finally took the leap and decided to learn how to draw after years of dancing around it. Keeps me occupied since school is kinda dead now.

Like millions of other Americans I hate what I do for a living. If there was a way to create even a reduced survival version of existence where I would be able to focus on what matters and what I care about instead of paying fucking bills, Id be all in.

Eh, I think we disproportionately see the people who are online all the time being happy. Most of the people I have talked to who arent the type to browse reddit or be an "inside" kind of person are pretty miserable atm.

I'd agree with that. I used to be a heavy gamer and basically lived online. Now I'm hyper social. I literally live to see people basically. My ideal week has 4-5 social occasions (as an example last week before social isolation in the UK I went on 2 dates and saw friends twice). I'm absolutely fucking miserable at the moment. My gym routine has been fucked, the swimming pool is closed, I can't see my friends enough, people don't want to go on dates + everything is basically closed anyway. I've been trying to get back into shit like gaming that I used to do all the time, but that's just not me anymore. Similarly my friends are all pretty annoyed and want to get out, it's just coming up on a week for us this Sunday.

I have a few friends who aren’t usually ‘inside people’ and we’ve recently gotten into the game Stardew Valley, it’s about tending to your land and bringing this small towns community back together. It’s a great thematic foil to the current sense of isolation everyone is feeling. It might not be for you/your friend group, but I wanted to recommend it all the same!

This is also a novelty. That will soon wear off and people will become increasingly restless.

I wish I was reconnecting with hobbies. Instead, this time has confirmed what I was already suspecting - that my boss is a psychopath. Her approach to this time is “why won’t you work 14 hour days, we’re all on lockdown, what else are you going to do?” I don’t know, take a fucking nap? Have dinner with my partner? Cry?

I agree. I’m nervous to even contemplate that right now, but when things settle into a new normal, will definitely be looking.

Yep. I'm chained to my desk at home now to prove I'm still being productive at home. If my company does layoffs I want to make the cut.

I work the next 13 days. My daughter always asks me when I get home why do I look so angry, and then asks me to play, but after 10+ hours of delivering mail/packages every single day, I just don't have the energy. I feel for everyone not being able to work, but I also envy people that actually get to spend time with their families. I haven't had two days off in a week without calling out sick since October.

Having hobby time is nice but I’m able to see my daughter more. I work 40hrs a week, and go to school full time. My days go from 6am-8pm on most days of the week. I wish I didn’t have to be away from my daughter so much. I feel like I’m not even a part of her life sometimes. That may be a dramatic statement but it sucks. Now, I get to see her everyday and I’m already going crazy keeping her in the house. She’s in her terrible twos lmao

Yeah but the problem is most of us live paycheck to paycheck because our economy is based on the bottom line profit. No work means no money for most of us.

As a grocery store worker I am still working my butt off for very little reward. And I can’t even buy supplies at the end of my shift because all of the fucking well to do fuckers have cleaned off the shelves. I can’t buy them at the beginning of my shift either because there’s no space to store anything and because everyone’s in a panic and it’ll just disappear

I crochet a lot and have a huge stash of yarn.    I’m currently still working but this may change.     I’m thinking of making blankets for the elderly or something useful.  But I’ve not decided yet.      Sometimes hospitals ask for premature baby things so maybe that.     Any suggestions welcome.

Blankets for the homeless, the elderly, premies, pets in shelters. All great options. I’d love to see whatever you end up creating.

Absolutely! I am still working from home (and feel busier in a lot of ways than before as I rush to convert a lot of service and instruction to online), but my son's daycare is closed too, so we're here together and it's really lovely to be able to spend more time with him. I do miss having colleagues who don't poop their pants so often though.

However, you also lose out on being able to go outside and do things whenever you want and soon people will run out of money. Already there is a massive stock market crash and we could see another depression. Not to mention loss of life from the pandemic. Sure not having to do anything for a little while would be fun but then after you get bored. People need money to pay the bills and eat etc. Plus you need money to fund hobbies and have a decent quality of life. i think a 4 day working week that some countries were trialing would be a much better way to go.

This is the entire thought process behind UBI and has been proven accurate and actually more productive to the community once tested.  ​ Universal Basic Income

If corporations didn't keep such huge amounts of money for presidents/stock holders/etc and gave more money to the workers then people wouldn't need to work sometimes six days a week and have minimal sick leave.  It would give humans more time and freedom to actually live as humans rather than rank and file numbers in some company's database

Definitely! We live in a hyper critical world and I always strive to include anyone I can because I definitely know what it's like to be lonely. It has really helped me build some decent friends over the years. My best friend just moved to a foreign country so it is definitely refreshing to have someone besides my wife to hang with outside of work and to be able to talk freely with. I love my wife but also think it's important to have more people to hang with than just her.( Probably something I carried with me from my social work degree that I never got a job with)

I feel like the people you work with are just a little bit jelly of Mr New and In Shape guy.  People often judge others and try to bring them down when they see people excelling in order to make themselves feel better.  You keep doing you, keep being friends with this guy and I bet you are helping him as much as he is helping you. It’s really easy to fall out of healthy habits when surrounded by an unhealthy work environment and judgmental people that don’t share the same goals you share.  You are helping this guy stay on track by being his friend and supporting him!

Yeah. I've never seen this kind of reaction so I'm not sure if it's just social distancing making people go crazy or what! They are definitely jelly!

Maybe it will help to know that manipulative people hunt in packs. This is how they validate their own shitty behay and thoughts. It sounds like the whole office ganged up on this guy because they felt their own false aire of superiority be threatened by someone who is clearly the better individual.

I mean, having a social work degree probably helps a lot. Still, many people do not have these skills. I still encourage all, to listen and to "defend" the weird and lonely at work. I had this guy at work, who was really really weird. We soon named him Taxi Driver. He then put more effort in his tries to socialize, and he failed even  harder. I was always neutral towards him, but as he literally shaved his head himself with an undercut, almost like the "real" Taxi Driver, i hit the breaks. He definitely was short before killing himself. He left the company eventually. I took him aside, taught him some social "rules" and he broke into tears... he never had a conversation with anyone, that was longer than one minute - for six months... (for me heaven, for him hell...)

These sound like toxic work environments. I do hope that you are sharpening your resumes and planning exit strategies. A bit of gossiping is normal, but the really negative stuff should be reserved for the casual meetings at the pub off hours.

I decided to hang with the "weird girl" from work back in '07. She's the kindest, smartest, most helpful person. She helps clean up when people's homes have been ravaged by floods, takes missionary trips to spread the gospel, and gives wads of money to charity.

The greatest lesson my father ever taught me was, "never judge someone based on what another said." I have made many beautiful friendships because of this advice.  Thanks dad :-)

So have I. A friend of mine told me he knew of my upcoming roommate and to keep my wits about him, for he stole stuff from my friend when they were working together. I chose to ignore that advise and to know him for real and by myself. He ended being a fantastic human being and becoming one of my best friends (and damn reliable to boot!). I agree with this thread  
Thanks! I felt embarrassed to ask him at first because he was in such good shape and I am not morbidly obese but definitely obese. I use to run 9 miles every other day in high school but college and married life, and this office job  took a toll on me.  
Never too late to get fit.

Chances are he enjoys helping, don’t take advantage of his kindness or time, and work hard, You owe it to the both of you. Also, take progress pics, they are motivation alone and fun when you see drastic changes.

Motivation will only get you started since you can't maintain it every time.  So just remember, if this is important to you, sometimes you just have to make yourself get up and go, even when you don't feel like it.  I promise you'll always be glad you did.  Exercise just has a way of improving your mood and making you feel good especially with a solid custom built plan.  Have fun!

I’m so happy for you both. It sounds like the people making fun of him are jealous he’s living a full life. Currently in my country gyms are Closed, so I am exercising in local parks which is deemed strange here. It was strange for me too, but after having done it for a week, I don’t know if I’ll go back to the gym. Being outside exercising is so invigorating, physically and mentally. I’ve currently dragged 3 friends out to do the same. At first they where really self conscious but now they enjoy it.  I’ve really learned what it means to step outside your comfort zone thanks to the corona. I’m glad you’ve experienced the same by reaching out to someone deemed weird by your colleagues. Tl;dr: also took a step into the unknown and feel much better for it. Go you!

The weight loss thing is awesome but even more important than that is this connection you made with another human. I hate sounding sappy, but the connections we have with our fellow humans are goddamned priceless. The older I get, the more I realize that.  
I definitely feel like I have! I was diagnosed with hypertension a few months ago and all those other people  who said I could join them at the gym always found excuses on short notice of why it wasn't a good time for me to join or the few times I did made me feel bad for being overweight.  
He is probably a secret Jedi master too. (Grin) so cool! Happy for you that you made a new friend.

This guy is giving you thousands of dollars worth of personal training for free. Now measure that against the health benefits + the time + education needed to acquire the health knowledge he is sharing with you, and it easily adds up to hundreds of thousands.

Oh fuck those other people!! Before this outbreak I finally got on an actual gym schedule..and stuck to it!! Which I'd never done. I went only three times a week, but I always invited my friends. Sometimes just a reminder message because a few of them had expressed interest in going. They usually showed up sporadically.  I would never put them down. I wouldn't be a real friend if I did. So happy for you man, you'll do great I know it. :)

Hey I also have high blood pressure. I was put on a super low dose medication and told to exercise and diet.  It's truly changed my life. I used to get so dizzy I'd collapse. Now, I'm expected to come off my blood pressure medicine sometime in the next year.  You will feel great the more exercise you do. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for improving your life!

Currently it's super simple. Mwf is a walk run with Friday being the longest for me. You can choose the distances as mine are specific to my. Current capacity. Yoga and stretching is Tuesday and Thursday. Also designed for where my. Current flexibility is. Saturday and Sundays are current just stretching. He only made it two weeks out and will evaluate it one I get that far! Hope your evening is going well!

Well, an inferiority complex along with poor emotional intelligence. I definitely have an inferiority complex myself and hate it when people do this. Either the people that make these kinds of jokes lack self awareness and an ability to look inwards at themselves, or they do possess those traits but don’t know how to deal with it so they try to bring people down to the level that they perceive themselves at to feel better, and as a result, end up actually putting themselves at that lower level.

Honestly, the way you described your friend - he sounds like a total dude who has carved out his own individuality and independence, and puts higher value on what he wants then what others think of him. Goals right there.

That’s the truth. Too many people let their insecurities define them and tell them they can’t change for the better with hard work. When they see someone coming along putting in that work to achieve a lofty goal, they knock it as unreasonable or unrealistic to attain.

When you mentioned he slept on his car I thought of that. People made fun of him, but he’s just vibin’ He sounds like a pretty cool guy honestly.  
Yeah. It's so dumb. It's like how people who try be vegetarian or vegan for health reason are the butt of so many jokes. My guess it's because others have their insecurities poked when someone comes along living life to its fullest.  
The other comments are trying to justify making fun veg people, smh

Haven't seen those comments yet but still have about a hundred to go through . I definitely don't mind poking fun at friends from time to time and I do have some vegetarian friends. It's one think to joke around as friends and definitely a whole other realm to constantly make fun of them. If somebody teases me about my. Quinoa burgers I am not offended. If they rough it up every day I may change my tune.  
The thing I never understood was how average people make fun of other people who are striving to be better than average.

 how average people make fun of other people who are striving to be better than average.  Average people don't like seeing others pushing themselves to excel, so they put them down to make themselves look better.

This is wonderful! My motto is always to judge a person by MY interactions with them, not hearsay and idle gossip around the office, school, etc. Sounds like you made a great friend who lifts you up and helps you reach your goals!

Exactly. I have learned to detest it and also to call people out on it when they are being horrible. I am fairly well liked across my department so I hope my comments help reduce some of this horrible stuff.

I totally agree. I no one wants to be judged but we're quick to criticize people who do things differently than us.

Super nice story! Just want to point out that a sub 10 minute mile is not bad, that's above average. The average person runs a mile between 10 and 15 mins. I run about a 13:40 mile with a 5K time of 43 mins. The average for my age group is 35 mins for comparison.

Thanks! I appreciate the encouragement. I need to stop being so harsh on myself. I have a problem comparing myself to my younger self when I could run sub 7 minutes miles( I think my too speed was 6 minutes and 20 seconds) . I have a problem where I live in my nostalgia and don't want to put the effort to get back into shape.  Plus needing to shed 60lbs of fat seems like such a daunting task I keep on giving up.

I couldn’t go out today and run a mile under 10 mins. Or 3 miles in one day. I am somewhat fit, but running my has never been a strong point. You keep that up and you should see serious results :0)

Thanks for the kind comment! I have about 60 lbs of fat I need to lose but he thinks I should be able to do have the gone and be ready to run a marathon by January. I don't have faith in myself yet but we will see.

You are also willing to go out there and just do it! No matter how tough or hat your time is, have confidence you did it while others are sitting down and trying to take you down to their level by discouraging you! 💪

A 10 minute mile for someone claiming to be obese is ridiculously good, and I'm not just saying that to lift your spirits or anything.  When I was in HS, in ok shape, my mile time was like a lazy ass 11 or 12 minutes.  Now that I'm in much better shape (10+ years later), went to the gym consistently this year till they shut down, I managed to bring it to around 8 mins, 7 something if I really pushed myself. But it kicks my ass at the end of it, and it's only a mile.  So you're doing really really well man.

Thanks again! I currently am at 250lbs and my doctor says I should be shooting. For 190. Hopefully with a good friend I will now be able to finally push hard!

Hey I just wanted to offer more support and say you can do this!  Last year I was way overweight and I wound up losing double what you are trying to lose. If you put your mind to it, you can definitely accomplish it. I wish you the best of luck and hope you accomplish all your goals!

I basically went from disabled to 85lbs down and power lifting in 13 months. I did nothing uncomfortable, didn't do a single second of running or cardio. There's all kinds of way to do it, I happened to enjoy being able to lift heavier things, so I focused on that. Turns out, once you figure out what Glycogen is, everything gets REAL easy to manipulate. Keep at it. Yoga or running hurt? Don't like it? Go watch some AthleanX videos on the cable machines.  That's where all my fun is done, on the road full time too so it's crappy hotel cable machines I end up using. Get a gym membership. Go have fun. Every single day. It wasn't long before I decided to also do morning workouts (likely where I lost the most weight, even though losing weight was never a goal). Ditch carbs and sugar, and go have fun. Easy progress. Just watch out for DOMS, they can last a few workouts but after that, no more soreness. Hell, some soreness I miss. Hamstring soreness felt really good for some reason. And calf workouts felt really good. Quads suck, I hate that shit. Just work big muscle groups on low to no glycogen (morning fasted workouts), and weight will literally fall off. I was losing 8% body fat a month for in hindsight, not a whole lot of effort.

I was about to say on a “meh” day I’m at 930(sometimes more than 10 when the miles add up)and I’ve been running for year. Just picking it up and getting under ten is fantastic.

 We then ran and I completed my first mile in under 10 minutes( I know this sucks)   ALL the BEST runners in the world run sub-10 minute miles. Every one of them.  So that's a fancy club to join.

I was kinda identifying with this guy. I'm really goofy and outgoing in real life, and I know for sure I stick out like a sore thumb to a lot of my coworkers. I feel life sometimes people just don't know how to deal with someone having a personality and passions that they feel comfortable expressing at work. So... Yeah. I assumed the guy in your story was like me. Goofy and outgoing, and perplexing to people used to an office environment

People always like to make judgements. Is this a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' type of thing or is being quiet inherently disadvantageous?

Being quiet is certainly not inherently disadvantageous. Maybe being silent, but being quiet most all the time and only interjection when you have something important to say, or relevant, is probably advantageous. It's just a balance I suppose.  I'd rather be too quiet than too loud anyway. Weird > Annoying any day lol

That's awesome! Great for you, you've made a new friend, made his work life easier, AND you're getting into shape!  I'm sure he put so much effort into your workout plan because you put effort into getting to know him. You both sound like really great people

Maybe instead of that bring lunch in for him.  "Ill grab lunch for the next week" This could also show that your following a good diet aswell as an appreciation for the training.

I feel you. When I was in high school and immature as hell, I used to crack jokes at the expense of others. As cliche as it sounds, I’ve learned to treat people as how I’d like to be treated, and if you’re good to me I’ll one-up you and treat you even better.

In regards to your later edits, it's even better. I'm a guy turning 40 this year and I've really struggled to make really close male friends. I can't even really quite explain it because I've definitely tried, and it's really hard for guys to really open up with each other and be actually close. And as someone who used to be that kind of weird guy who nobody liked, good on you too!

For sure. I definitely feel that way as well often! I have some theories as to why that is the case but I believe it is absolutely essential for a satisfying life to have close guy friends. I love my wife deeply but I would argue that just having my wife as a friend would be very unhealthy. I've discovered that most guys do want to be heard and be able to express their feelings but many are systematically raised in a way that negates those opportunities. Thanks for your comment! I definitely appreciate it! I am currently overloaded with notifications as this post blew up but definitely feel free to message me if you want to discuss it further or have any insight! Hope you have a fantastic evening!

I probably will message you later! The two big eye opening articles for me were this one and its follow up. It really opened my eyes a lot. I have a lot of gay male friends and, while straight and happily married myself, have had a lot of experience with hugs and arms around and even like.. kind of snuggling on couch in completely non-sexual ways. I think it' s a shame that's so rare nowadays.

I can sorta relate. We have this guy who just can't avoid making simple mistakes every once and while. While seemingly forgetful, he can remember baseball facts like the Red Rox lineup in 1929. He's shit on by nearly everyone at work but always happy and smiling while co-workers avoid talking with him.  Well, one of those coworkers ran into him in Las Vegas randomly at a party (opening of casino or something). This supposedly awkward oddball guy happened to be the life of the party outside of work. Just shows how some people can have an entirely different life outside of work.

Exactly. There's some quote about if you judge a fish by how well it climbs a tree it will think its whole life that it is a failure. That's the reason I try to not make blanket judgments in people when I am training them in and they do not perform well. I bluntly tell them the reasons they need to hit certain criteria and explain if they can't it doesn't make them a bad person it just means they either need to put more work into it or find a different job that is better suited for the skills they have. That's why I also recently put my two weeks notice in is because while I was good at my job I didn't enjoy and I want to doing something that I can both thrive at and enjoy.

"Weird" people often have a unique perspective. Once you get to know them, you see they're probably more genuine than the rest. (Weird, not creepy!)

Exactly. I definitely get pegged as weird as well for my frustration with the consumeristic society we live in, the 40 hour work week and the amount of money people spend on stuff to try to happy. Whenever I bring up my tiny house plans when people ask me what I plan to do I definitely get some adverse comments. People fear what's different but that's not going to stop me and that definitely is not going to stop my new friend.

Why do you think people make fun of him?  
Why do you think people make fun of him?  
Probably because he is doing yoga in the parking lot, sleeps on top of his car during lunch breaks, and does stretches and yoga in between calls. He also walked through an emergency exit once because he wasn't thinking. Definitely not things to make fun of somebody for but definitely not how mainstream coworkers in offices usually act. I think some people might be a bit intimidated by someone who does not care about looking when and where he exercises.

I think you hit the nail on the head with this comment. People tend to shy away from others that go against their own short comings.  I.e. they care too much about appearances and aren’t fully themselves. Please stick with your new friend. It sounds like you can both be a great person in each others lives! And awesome on the under 10 mile- that’s amazing!

Thanks! I thought I was going to die. My heart was racing and I just wanted to quit buy he kept it super casual and kept on motivating me. Normally I wouldn't have made it past the .25 mile marker before giving up. We did a total of 3.1 miles but I was so happy for the consecutive one mile part!

Have you asked why he sleeps on top of his car? That's the only part of the story that confuses me. At my previous job I would spend half my lunch break napping in my car most days.

It's specifically for where I am in exercise and fitness.  Not sure it would be super helpful. but it's a blend of running and yoga to begin with.  It's running and walking MWF and TH are yoga and stretching and Saturday and Sunday are stretching or making up for missing a day during the week. It's only charted two weeks out as all the numbers will be adjusted at the end of every two weeks depending where I am. I definitely get that one person who makes a difference. I guess I got that in reverse where I put in a bit of effort and got an A+ friend with it.

I have been using the mapmyrun app and they let you pick what your goal is and tell them how much you can run now and they will give you a plan with rest days and goals, I just did my first run in that plan today, it said I hit my goal but I think I was a few seconds long. I think it's alright! Also I think there's a subreddit called couch to 5k or something like that that probably has some plans too.

Hey! You two seem like real nice people :) The only reason people make fun of him is because they’re too insecure to do anything that he does, themselves. Don’t worry, you seem to have found someone who doesn’t seem to care about what others think, and is confident about himself. That’s the best someone can ask for 🙈

Unfortunately the best, coolest, and nicest people are usually the ones to get made fun of.

I have a friend who is homeless and I hear a lot about it but we have been friends for about 5 years. When I met him, he was about 38. He's just really far on the alcoholism spectrum. He's a funny guy though. We bring him left overs  of our dinner. He has favorite meals. He has been known to dictate what we have for dinner on a few nights.  I make no apologies for being his friend and it seems that other people want one, "Why are you friends with him?" Me: "Well that's not a nice question. You know I'd never answer anyone if they asked me why I was friends with you!" Often, people want the friends who will make them look good (or at least not make them look too bad) and that leaves some people out in the cold. Often, it leaves some of the best people out in the cold. Congratulations to you for having the courage to step out and learn about someone who is different. Congratulations to him for having such a great friend.

It will probably save me thousands of dollars in gym memberships and health care related costs. He is definitely an A+ person. Not let's see if I can stay committed!

You can definitely do this! It’s not about being perfectly on track all of the time, but to keep making progress. No matter how many times we fail! Don’t give up OP!

Not just your personal trainer. Or coworker. Sounds like a new friend. Yay to that!

For sure! The friendship part has been the coolest part but the fitness aspect has definitely been a plus and it gives us an excuse to hang out outside of work on the regular. Which is pretty cool!

It’s always good to befriend a diverse group of people bc you never know when you need somebody. So many times the “weird awkward” kid ended up being somebody who helped me tremendously just bc I gave them the time of the day. Perfect example is when I sat next to a group of kids who were sitting far away from others on the first day of lecture. Started a convo, made a groupchat, and they ended up being my tutor throughout the semester and another class we took together the following semester. I would grab lunch with them after class and before tests. Best seating choice I’ve made.

Forget the haters, people will hate just because they see someone who is genuinely happy. That guy sounds like a true friend, keep him in your life and do the same for him when he needs it. 👌🏽

For sure. I knew I was committed to this when I took off my shirt and ran bare chested. I am normally a very self conscious person but decided that if this is how runners run then this is how I shall run. We are in this together! Definitely hope it is a long lasting friendship!

His name is not that but I am pretty sure he has pictures at his desk of both David  and someone by the name of Mark Allen in his desk. My new friend apparently runs ultramarathons and Mark Allen is his inspiration.

Long interview with him if you want to watch a little of him. I think you might relate to some of the first half hour, at least.

This makes me feel good. I have always been the odd man out and get made fun of because I beat to my own drum and it can really get me down sometimes. Thank you for being that person who is willing to treat others with kindness.

 I completed my first mile in under 10 minutes( I know this sucks)   In the grand scheme of runners going 4 min miles? Maybe. But sub 10 min miles aren't easy. I barely hit them myself. Congrats! Remember, the most important thing about fitness is making it a habit. Just get yourself to do anything for 2 months, and then you'll stick with it  
I befriended a guy at work that a lot of people look down on and make fun of and it is changing my life.
Sounds like a class dude. Both of you. And don’t feel bad about the ten minute mile time. That’s the best I can ever do. I’ve run two marathons and can’t do better than a 10 minute mile. And that’s usually only for mile 1. Go for it. Start with a half and then go for the full. I’m not going to lie, the training sucks, but the race itself can be a blast.

Thanks! Comparison is the thief of job and I judge myself on the fact I used to run 6 minute and 20 seconds miles. I was also frustrated I could only do half Marathons while my sister and father would run marathon. I appreciate the encouragement and also need to realize that an accomplishment is an accomplishment and it doesn't need to be compared to others! Congratulations on the 2 marathons! My friend wants me to try to run one in January but to me that is crazy!

The people making jokes about him are probably just projecting their own insecurities. Good on you for reaching out to him despite what your other peers may think, sounds like you are on your way to a healthier lifestyle and you both managed to pick up a good friend along the way congrats to both of you.

(I love your username.  Many people have tried to characterize what disorder I have that compels me to purge and start over and your name nails it :) People, especially in a work environment, want to keep things normal as much as possible. I get it and respect it but can't abide.  I am the new weird person at work - I do yoga on break and meditate before I eat lunch every day. I always pass up the free snacks/pizza because I am low carb and will never budge. I do not tell anyone what I am doing and don't do any of it in the open but like your new co-worker, I am well aware these habits are foreign to most and accept I won't be making a lot of friends at work.  The ONLY reason I do any of these things is because my mental and physical health was in the toilet a few years ago and I never want to feel like that again. I applaud those who can keep it together without good habits but I am not one of them.  It is AWESOME that you have connected with him in a way that will benefit you both, that is not work related and you could be stoked about for the rest of your life.  It says a lot of good about you.

In high school in the late '80s/early '90s, I was always the outcast and am so thankful for the few close friends that bothered to approach me back then. Now that I've come out of my shell a bit more, I make sure to always seek out the outcast in any group and chat with them. The weirdos always have the best stories. Always embrace the weirdos.

This is the power of human connection and just reach out. He probably thinks just as happily and positively of you, as a new friend who reached out to him while others were alienating him/making fun of him.  So onwards to a good, functioning adult friendship!

If you’ll take some advice, stop at the half marathon. There is nothing about a running marathon that’s good for the human body beyond proving you can. It’s not healthy and often leads to a variety of stress injuries.  Run the half and set other goals for yourself to push yourself in different ways. Weightlifting/Bodyweight workout goals, etc.

This is such a nice story. I have a soft spot for those kind of people - the ones other people ignore or make fun of. I try to go out of my way to befriend them :)

Not sure if it’s apocryphal, but a colleague of mine (white guy) once told me a story about not being allowed into a store and having his attention directed to a sign outside of said store, “no whites” or similar. He asked our Chinese colleague about it. He said the store was probably selling shit like black rhino horns and ivory.  Apparently they think all white people are snitches.  Maybe you’d be allowed in as a black guy as long as you also did not identify as western? Anyway the impression I get is that there aren’t really racist “parts” so much as racist homes and racist stores.  Case-by-case stuff.  I could be wrong though.  I’d also like to hear more first-hand experience.

There's probably a lot more intentional racism directed at other asians in China than there is intentional (albiet probably a lot of unintentional) racism towards outsiders.

I was stationed in Japan back in the early 90’s and my roomate was a brother.  He comes home late one weekend (we had duty on Monday) and says “Man, you ain’t gonna believe this shit!”  I ask him what he means.  Troy was dating a Japanese local and that weekend was the first time they had been intimate.  Troy tells me that he took his clothes off and she’s staring at him.  He asks her “what’s up?” and, no shit, she asks him where his tail was.  Swear to God, this girl though black folks had tails.  I was fucking blown away.

My chiropractor is Jewish and went to med school somewhere in the southern US. He met people who'd never met a Jewish person before, and they wanted to know where his horns were, or to feel his upper forehead to see if the horns were under his hair. This was in the 80s I believe. We have a lot of ignorance at home.

How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment

For that money, I'm surprised you didn't stick around the Great Wall for a week or hit the other tourist traps. You and photo stall guy could have taken that show on the road and made bank.  Edit: You got any photos of this?

Assuming this guy just worked 2 days a week doing this he'd be making 6 figures. Even if I absolutely hated China I'd probably consider sticking around for a year or so to do that.

I wouldn’t get that much. You’re forgetting it’s China. Everything is under the microscopic eye. I might have gotten lucky that day but I’m pretty sure that would never happen again. China is not like other countries, you really need to get off the police radar for anything cuz they can be assholes to you for real. But that wasn’t my main reason of leaving. I stayed in China because I had a court dispute with a chinese company and the court demanded that I bring notarized documents from back home(which meant I had to go)

The police/officials shaking people down is very real. My friends and I had a small bar that made enough money to get by but mostly it was running at even because it was such a small place it was hard to turn a lot of profit. But the local street police only saw foreigners and assumed we were raking in the big bucks. That means we got hit up for money multiple times. My favorite being the time a building inspector (or whatever he said he was) said our front door opened the wrong way and we had to pay a fine. It opened out from the bar, like it was supposed to, and had been that way since before we owned the place. 500rmb (about $60 usd) and no receipt but at least we were left alone for a couple weeks.

Couldn't you just cut in the police to keep them off you back?

The problem there is that if he was there every day making that kind of money it's 100% certain that eventually he would either be arrested for doing this without some made up kind of permit or straight up robbed.

Stay too long and cops or gangs start to take notice either wanting in on the money or getting rid of you for ruining the Chinese culture etc.

As a white guy who has been to China: it is ignorance, but it is innocent ignorance. Here in America I am a normal guy, when I go to China I am absolutely a minority. Babies and old men stare at me when I'm out in public. I don't give a fuck. but I only have to go for 2 weeks at a time. If I was there for 3 months, and I was black, I'd probably eventually lose my mind.  I was standing in line at the airport one trip with a black woman who taught English and we talked for a while. I can only imagine what it would be like to be a black woman in rural China.

How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment  
Somewhere on the Great Wall is a photo booth owner who has a story about a random black guy who showed up to his stall and made him bank for a day. I imagine that is more than he makes in a week.

And think of how many homes have pictures of him! Some day historians are going to find those photos and be like, wtf?  
How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.

And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment  
Holy shit, man!  This is the most Epic foreigner at China story I’ve heard, ever!  I spent six years there at Hangzhou. It’s less in your face over here, especially since there are many universities and more foreigners. I actually loved my six years of study there, but would never work there.  
How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.

Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment  
This sounds like a more extreme version of what my partner and I experienced in Delhi. We are white, and my partner has long, very blonde hair. In the streets of the city, no one batted an eye lid (except a scammer every two minutes but that's another story). But when we went into the tourist sites, suddenly everyone wanted selfies with us, or were covertly filming. It was later explained to us that people in the tourist sites were likely to be from remote rural villages, and similar to what you said, they had never seen a white person before. I'm sure they had on TV/film, but clearly they wanted a record to show their friends that they had seen an actual white person. Seems we were more interesting to them then Lal Quila!

Was like when I studied in Japan. There was myself and another black guy and a couple white guys.  Whenever we went to tourist sites in smaller towns we got a bunch of school kids wanting pictures with us, but never in Tokyo or Kyoto or the other major cities.

I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment  
This some entrepreneurial thinking, good on you man.

Parents complain about it pretty often. I've heard it can make a school look low quality. White women have first pick for any jobs, although there is such a high turn over, its still not that hard to find something if your qualified. Not all schools are like that, but i definitely know some teachers that probably shouldn't be teaching, but get paid more than long term professional teachers. You get used to it though.

Lol nah, im black, but im not a full time teacher. Overall, outside of teaching(and taxis), korea is way less racist than a lot of other places in Asia. I just teach adults, and work at my friends bar.

My brother is Caucasian with wavy/curly blond hair, blue eyes, and he's pretty damn tall. Overall just a big strongly built guy.  He went to China on a school trip & so many people stopped him to ask for photos - totally random strangers. He was a bit weirded out.

That happened a bunch on my school trip too. Some people got asked more than others but I think we all took pictures at some point. Our Chinese trip leaders explained it as them just wanting to interact with you. It’s not really about the picture it’s about finding a reason to talk to a foreigner in a place you don’t see them very often. Once I understood that I actually found it pretty fun to get asked for a picture and I even asked for a couple myself. At one stop my friends and I kept seeing this girl looking at us and sort of waving. On our way out we saw her again and asked her if she wanted a picture and we got to have a bit of a conversation. Still felt a bit weird, but overall harmless.  
My funniest racism experience in China
When I had an 8 hour layover in Taipei, Taiwan (Amazing city), I really got to experience what it was like being a black guy in a country where there weren't many. After I left a restaurant, this little girl stared at me and pointed me out to her father. I have long dreadlocks and she was making motions around her head while pointing. That family coincidentally ended up following us to the zoo, which you have to take a glass bottom gondola to, and everytime I looked back at her, her eyes were locked onto me and my family. When I got to the top of the mountain, there was some sort of food court with a bunch of different stands preparing food for people. While walking through and seeing what kind of fair food Taiwanese people ate I heard a voice shout at me. "HEY! Black man!" The source of the voice was a man running a stall that served an assortment of fried foods, so I walked over. When I got there, he pointed down at his fryer and with a huge grin said,  "Chicken!" I couldn't hold back my laughter. It was the most entertaining racism I have ever experienced.

No, unfortunately I did not. I was traveling with family and we had already gotten lunch. Instead of going to a Taiwanese restaurant, they wanted to go to McDonald's because it'd be easier to order with pictures. Taiwanese McDonald's sells bone-in fried chicken and that's what I got. It was not good, it tasted like crispy grease, and made me sick to my stomach. I wanted to try some but I also wanted to avoid an emergency because I didn't know how to ask "Where's the restroom?" in Taiwanese. :(

facts dude i went to Japan and my dad is white, so they took photos with him. but then, two black dudes in SUITS come rolling down the street, and it looked like a bunch of teens from the early 2010's just saw justin bieber. it was insane, there must have been like 50 people around them

Yup, i come from a chinese city and despite living in France for years i got surprised when i saw a black guy casually walking in my hometown. Thing is, China is so closed you don't expect to see strangers at all... So whenever chinese people see strangers they start doing weird things and treating them like animals. Most of them don't even understand what multiculturalism is, and the whole mentality is a few centuries late. I'm sorry they treat you this way, just ignore them!  Merry christmas :)

Yep that's the way I see it. They're not racist by choice it's more inexperience and curiosity if anything.  If I saw a 7ft tall blue man for the first time in my neighbourhood I'm pretty damn sure I'd stare and maybe even try to get a picture and talk to them.

Bro I’m following, stoked to hear the story but sorry you had to go through it. They even brought out a book and made me go through and say I didn’t have any weed, or cartridges and had to point at pictures because there was a pretty big language barrier and I was like no man I didn’t bring anything like that. It was my first international flight and I was tired because I hadn’t slept for like 17 hours and sweaty from the cramped plane so I def looked haggard but damn me and this other dude got singled out hard.

I traveled to China once when I was younger. I’m also black and people would follow me, stroke my hair, grab my arm and touch my skin, and take pictures of me also without saying a word (not like I would be able to understand them but) I was like 14 so it was super uncomfortable. But I realized they don’t see black people outside of tv too often.

I had an uncomfortable situation with Chinese visitors at a university where I worked. It was graduation and a celebratory time. When a family came out and started talking to me and my friends I thought it was just happiness from the event. They hugged me and talked with me. It was nice. I DID think it was odd when they wanted a picture with me, but I obliged. It was only later that I realized they wanted a pic with me because I was morbidly obese. I still burn with humiliation over that. My friends and some acquaintances witnessed it, but no one ever mentioned it again. I’ve lost a lot of weight since then, but I’m still very heavy. My job now involves working with the local international population, including those very new to the US, and luckily I haven’t experienced that again. I think I have a better understanding of the cultural basis for it and would handle it much differently. But, God, that was an awful feeling.

Not totally related but it happened in college and your story reminded me. I was a TA for a bioanthropology class. The other TA was a grad student from China. She was nice and very polite but had not been on the US long. We were discussing possible lab activities to do involving osteology, really basic, fun stuff, as this was an intro level class for mostly non-majors. She, in front of myself, the other TA, and the Professor, suggested we do one where we compare the skills of different human ancestors along with different races, and implied that East Asians, followed by White Europeans are most evolved and that Africans were more "primitive" and closer to our hominid ancestors. Obviously this idea is unscientific and racist, but the Prof had to calmly explain to her how we don't really subscribe to that idea in the West and just how inappropriate it was. The Chinese TA said she understood but seemed skeptical... I believe she also once told me that she believed that East Asians did not originate in Africa from a common ancestor like the other races, but had evolved in parallel somehow. I have no idea how either of these ideas fit into the scientific consensus on modern China, but she accepted them quite casually.

Yep. China believes that White people are superior to them or at least equal and that every other race is less evolved (with blacks being at the very bottom). It's such a cringe mentality

I was trying to catch a taxi on a street corner in Suzhou and a kid came up to me and asked if I speak English. Then he told me hours whole life story, how he had just Arrived in town to start university, the first person in his family to her higher education, so much opportunity in China not like it was for his grand parents in the village or his parents in the factory, on and on for about 15 minutes. Then he goes ‘anyway, your the first foreigner I’ve ever met and I’ve always wanted to ask, how do you manage with that massive nose? Doesn’t it get in the way?’

Actually quiet the opposite. I really have good friends that are Chinese and I still have a Chinese business partner. It’s just that Chinese from the countrysides and Chinese from the cities are a lot different. It’s even harder for a chinese from the city to get along with a chinese from the countryside, let alone a black guy like me. And like I said in my story, all this is ignorance and not arrogance mostly. But the problem is , there’s a billion of you and one of me and you can imagine how frustrating it can get when you just want to piss and everyone in the toilet is literally waiting to see the black guys penis.

LMFAO! Don’t get me started on that. I already have difficulty using urinals or “going” when someone is speaking to me. There was this once that I was in a hurry and tried to use a urinal... I shit you not, I turn around and there were three people trying to look over my shoulder. That was one of my biggest wtf moments there! I was just like, “never mind, I never needed to use the restroom anyways... it’s okay, I can wait until my bladder explodes”  X’’D

Have you seen the female toilets even in the cities? Some cubicles have no doors!!!!!  Nobody warned me prior to my first public lavatory visit in a swanky mall. With Chanel and luxury boutiques, you’d assume that it’s safe. Well, I strutted into the lavatory. Seeing that the first cubicle had its door swung open, I proceeded towards it.  Lo & behold. A lady was squatting with her cauliflower in full splendour and taking a dump. She didn’t bat an eyelid. I was in shock for a few seconds before stumbling out of the lavatory, clearly forgetting my initial purpose of the trip.  My friends started guffawing when they saw my mortified expression & realised what my eyeballs had been subjected to.  I curled up in a foetal position that night and avoided cauliflower for a long time.

Oh I think I know who you're talking about! Her name is lilypetals I think. These vlogs always show people coming up, getting a friend to take a pic then just walking off without saying a word. It's one thing to not ask for permission, but then to not even say hey/bye/thanks is disgusting. Almost like taking a pic with a statue....

That’s not bad.. the Chinese version of that ,would be to come up to you and rub your skin really hard and rough, expecting to see the black coming off your skin. And they’re doing all this ,like 5 old women circling you and they don’t even ask you for permission(not that I’d want my black to come off😂), they just stop you rudely and start rubbing.. I became a very rude and defensive person after a while.

Your tolerance must be like top 1% worldwide. Can I ask why are you there? I'd gone mad living among rude people like that.

You have to be patient if you live in China because everyone disrespects you. I’m not exaggerating here. EVERYONE DISRESPECTS YOU. But the patience wears off and you start becoming rude like them after a while and you won’t even know it. I found out that I had become an angry person after I left China and i really needed some time to get to my old self. I used to have a business partnership with a chinese company and they bailed on me taking everything we worked for and I tracked them and sued them there(it took a whole year),, I won and I got my money in the end...

My funniest racism experience in China
A friend of mine (gay male) went to China for a very opportune career experience, going to spend a year.  He came back after a month, thoroughly spooked.  
My funniest racism experience in China
my friend went to china over summer break and she walked in the door of a little clothing shop and the lady at the counter saw her and said “OH!!!! BLACK PLUTO!!” and she ran to get a shirt that had, well, Pluto from mickey mouse except he was black  
My funniest racism experience in China
When my family lived there, we were getting in the car and my dad was strapping my baby sister into the car seat when he got caught between the car frame and the door because a car with a Chinese woman was scraping her car against ours. It’s quite hard to forget my dad yelling out in pain like that. My mom was on the other side of the car helping my brother and she started really panicking because she could only hear what was going on. My dad fortunately had no real harm done other than some gnarly bruises along his shins. When the police showed up, it was us who were getting blamed rather than the woman driving the other car. My parents, having lived there for around a year and being white, knew that this was just how things were and just tried to be more cautious in the future. We’ve also been refused service many times because we’re not Chinese despite my mom knowing a fairly good amount of Chinese. This leads to funny situations where someone will talk about us and my mom, being as outgoing as she is, will then turn to the people and join in on their conversation. Edit: changed remember to forget  
My funniest racism experience in China
I lived in China for a month. I have albinism, so I got a lot of curious stares and "sly" selfies.  
My funniest racism experience in China
My roommate from Zimbabwe said she would have crowds following her thinking she was Rhianna. She had an overall bad experience as a tourist traveling with only one friend in the rural parts because of the lack of respect for her physical boundaries.... And yeah, folks trying to rub off her melanin. She also disliked the pissing and spitting in public right next to her table at restaurants.  Unfortunately, she moved to Jersey City, so she can't really get away from THAT.

My funniest racism experience in China
yeah all the people going "well they've just never seen a black person before".... fair enough.  rap music and photo ops are harmless.  it's curiosity not racism.  I live in Shanghai and have been in China for more than 3 years. Lost count of the times I've had students parents ask me if black people are allowed at X university in America because they don't want their kid to go to a school where they'll get shot.  At least 20+ times.  it's so difficult to explain to a Chinese parent that its super unlikely that a black student at NYU is going to shoot your kid because school shooters are usually white.  
I talked a teen jumper down from the rail on the bridge 4 1/2 years ago. Today I found him working in a sit-in coffee shop I was trying out since I moved.
I disagree with approaching him directly, since he recognized you but didn't speak to you; he only wrote a note on your receipt -- a way of saying "I know who you are and I've always hoped to thank you but it's too embarrassing/difficult to bring it up and talk about it." Another approach: what if you visited the diner again and sat for a while lingering over coffee -- maybe if you were to say, "It's good to see you," in a non-pressuring way, HE would now initiate a conversation. If he doesn't, that's OK but you haven't pushed.

10/10. I have a bunch of 70-100 year old great-great-something’s that have pretty candidly pointed out that asking someone who’s dying “how they are” isn’t what they want to hear. Just that it’s good to see them, or something similar.  
"It's good to see you," would be perfect.  
OP, Please use these words the next time you see him.

Yeah those words "good to see you" are the most powerful and meaningful in this context.

I agree, I wouldnt start chatting him up about it, but maybe leave a thoughtful message on a card or something for him. Like 'I think about that day from time to time, your life changed mine too, and I'm glad I've been able to see you again. If you ever want to talk, let me know, or if you'd like me to get coffee elsewhere from now on, I'd be happy to oblige.'

I hope I don't nitpick, but I see two somewhat problematic details in your example and it might be helpful, for you or anyone else. Now I don't write from a scientific point of view but simply someone who have struggled a lot with mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, and who have talked to many in the same situation. (And sorry in advance for bad english, I'm not native english speaker and for some reason this text was harder to write than usual) With that said, the kid wrote on the note "You have no idea how much I think about you and what you did.", don't answer that with "I think about you from time to time" and don't bring up getting coffe elsewhere. Reason being that he might still be struggling with whatever made him want to jump in the first place, and many struggling with these things have a tendency to interpret things more negatively. As an example, a possible reaction to number one is getting sad that you're not thinking as much about it as he does, or bringing up staying away can be read as you not wanting to see him again. I hope this comment isn't seen as negative, I only want to spread awareness about how words can change meaning depending on what you struggle with.

As a guy who himself went through dark times and wanted nothing but to talk discreetly, one option is to leave an easy contact option on an innocent sticky note: just a Reddit handle or a Snapchat or whatever. Put the ball in his court, it's his move from there

I totally agree. If the young man wanted to speak to his rescuer I would think he would have gone up and spoken to him. Just know you saved his life and he is eternally grateful! ❤❤❤❤❤

Not necessarily. Many people have trouble initiating any kind of social interaction, but that doesn't mean they don't want it.

Exactly. He may have just started his shift or something and just wanted to focus on work and NOT talk about this obviously traumatic event whilst on shift.  By the note he left, it wouldn’t be surprising if he did want to talk to OP at some point.  “It’s good to see you” really seems to be the way to go in engaging with this guy though.  Good luck op

I've been suicidal and struggled with mental health issues for a long time and if this was me in this situation I would leave a note just like this guy did and hope he gave one back, letting me know it's safe to approach and maybe giving a way in (like a phone number, email adress or ask when I quit, if I want to talk). So I should definetly not interpret this as "I should keep my distance", but it's also important to not disturb during working hours as the possible stress might be unpleasant.

Personally I think this is too passive.  I feel like the guy writing on the paper specifically saying he thinks back on it a lot, nothing would feel greater than to have the person that once saved you be absolutely proud of what you've become and give you a hug.  But then again that's just me, I know these days people are a lot more reserved.

Thank god someone here said it I'm like wtf is everyone else here crazy of course he wrote it on a receipt everyone raise your hands if tomorrow at work you would have zero issue addressing that one time you almost killed yourself. Also possible employee rules that specifically state no non work related or generally considered negative topic conversations. (They may even include specific language about use of "trigger words") just ask him if you can chat outside of work after a little setup including how he is keep it chill and just know to back off if he seems uncomfortable but let him know you would like to chat. I mean I get it a lot of us here have social issues so we kind of just assume the guys a redditor but guess what maybe he's actually had the sex and just knows since OP is alone they realized they were a redditor so they left the note as they didn't want OP to run out screaming when a human talked to them? (Shh I know OP is actually a caring well rounded person as their post clearly illustrates I'm just kidding around)

I agree, if he spent years thining about dude it's not too awkward to talk about. This dude already saw him at his worse, and obviously he was doing a lot better and more happy with his life. Nothing embarrassing about rising from the ashes! But maybe odd in front of customers.

 At this point its almost rude not to.  it's most definitely rude not to, it could mean so much to him to see you again /u/CantMatchTheThatch and see that you're proud of the progress he's made, at the very least a "i'm so happy to see you're doing well" and a handshake, at the very least. p.s. Were I in your shoes I, without being forceful, I'd at least make every effort to give him the opportunity to enter my life, or at least remind him that if he ever needs the support again he can reach out and I'll always be there, when nobody else cared enough, you did, that could really bloom into something beautiful that you both treasure for life, even if nothing comes from it, you won't have to live your life wondering if he ever needed you to be there again.

I think you may be right but clear communication is never a bad thing. Attempting to talk, but respecting their boundaries if they are not interested, is fine IMO

I agree with you to a certain extent. That applies to "normal" conditions, not when someone was committing suicide. A small mistake in the conversation could trigger a large unwanted reaction. You can never know how that person feels or thinks about certain things, and it's better to let them push the boundaries to wherever they feel comfortable

could also be because they are in a working environment, where you leave your personal life at the door and focus on the job.  
That was very kind of you to not approach him on it. But as he initiated contact, I would say hello, and ask how he has been.  
I agree with this! Or "hi, good to see you again" would be good if you're nervous about starting a direct tell-me-what-you've-been-up-to conversation with him. It puts the ball in his court and if he just opens up, then keep the chat going. If he just wants to leave it at that, then it'll be forever a wonderful memory of your kind actions.

This is the best response in the thread... him making contact with you shows a level of comfort within him that should facilitate you reaching out to him.  
I talked a teen jumper down from the rail on the bridge 4 1/2 years ago. Today I found him working in a sit-in coffee shop I was trying out since I moved.
How far away did you move? Crazy to think you might've come across each other again 500 miles away.

I would leave him a note back and say how happy you are to see him again. Maybe talking to him directly could be a little too much, but a note should be okay since he initiated contact.

I would go with a note as well. Him saying those words out loud may have been too emotional, I'd imagine talking about it is still hard. I would just write "you're very welcome, it's good to see you're still here" and leave my name, kind of as an invitation to initiate a conversation if he feels comfortable.

OP, I think it would be much better to visit the coffee shop CLOSE TO CLOSING TIME.  The young man may fear getting emotional while at work. He probably also doesn't want his employer or fellow employees to know what happened in his past.  Maybe he will ask if you want to go for a pizza or a beer, or you can ask if he feels like it.

Chills reading this, I l was in a bad car accident when I was young. Didn’t know the people who stopped to help. But years later I saw them parking down the road at a different shop. I ran and hugged them. It’s strange how the mind remembers. Don’t know if I could pick them out of a line up today but at that moment I just knew it was them. Edit: what I’m trying to say is maybe it took him a minute to recognize you. And when he did he didn’t know how to react. I think you did the exact right thing. PS. It may have taken him a moment to realize who you were. And he may not be ready to talk about what happened that day. Leave it be knowing you are an amazing human and did something so great that day.

If you didn’t want to make him uncomfortable by asking how he was you could just say “It is great to see you!” With the happiest grin possible. Because that’s true. And affirms his choices.

Fuck ya that’s the way to do it. I agree.  And if you go out of your comfort zone and talk someone off a ledge so to speak then you’ve really done a kind, selfless thing and you have every right to be excited to see this person again and be happy to connect in such a random way.  I’d want to sit down over a meal and just fucking talk and make sure dude was actually doing good and just celebrate life for ten minutes. If that wasn’t reciprocated then by all means I’d fuck right off but man I’d feel such a bond I’d really wanna attempt to converse away from the job. Maybe I’m fucking weird.

Steps you need to take. 1) Make sure someone you trust knows this is happening 2) Get to a doctor ASAP! Even if it’s a MedExpress or similar.  3) That desire you’re feeling is now enemy number one. Every other struggle is now irrelevant.  4) Know that you are one of us. A silly human on this silly planet doing silly things in silly ways.  I love you.  
I will surely remember this. Thankyou   A silly human on this silly planet doing silly things in silly ways.

I'm sorry but what is a medexpress or anything similar gonna accomplish? I suffer from depression daily, and even on my state Medicaid program, no one has helped. Medexpress literally sent me back to the PCP that refered me to them for my next panic attack

This is a wild post for me to read today, of all days! At the beginning of January I also talked down a girl (18) who was about to jump from a high bridge I was running across. I had no idea what to say, so I just invited her back to my apartment for hot chocolate since I lived nearby. We made it part of the way there when the police showed up and took her to the hospital. I managed to give her my number before they took her and she finally called me a couple of days ago. We met up for coffee this afternoon. She looked and sounded like she was doing a lot better, though of course things are still hard for her being that young and on her own. She thanked me and said she was so happy she hadn't jumped and that I'd come along when I had. I thanked her for being alive, and told her to call me any time. I hope we stay in touch! I'm sure the person you helped is happy to have had the chance to see and talk to you too. It must have been nice to see him after such a long time, I thought about the girl I met many times in just the last two months.

I think the best option if you want to talk to him is to let him decide. Leave a way for him to contact you and let him decide when and if he is ready. It might happen right away, it might not happen for many years, and it might not happen at all, but giving him the option and allowing him to choose is the right thing to do.  Thanks for sharing this story.

DO IT! He has been thinking about you for 4 1/2 years! You are his hero. Just be modest and tell him how it made your day to see him doing his thing! Obviously he is in a healthier place if he is taking care of himself and expressing his personality. He intiated contact so I wouldn't say it's out of bounds to say hi, just keep it simple and if he wants to get deeper he will. Someone saved my life 4 days ago and I'm not letting them out of my world

You seem like a very thoughtful and respecting person. Probably, it won't hurt to pay attention to your gut feeling. Do you want to speak to him, did you feel like he might want to talk?  I agree with those saying to go there again, if you want to, and just be there, open for a conversation but without any expectations

An honest smile with a friendly but a bit reserved "it's so nice to see you" is always acceptable. Leave it to the other person if they want to do more than return the smile and continue with their day. They can always say "hi" or "you too" and move on, then you nod and go back to your day.

Good on you for leaving the ball in his court re: initiating contact. Since he’s given the okay, I’d say it’d be fine to chat with him and catch up a bit  
I talked a teen jumper down from the rail on the bridge 4 1/2 years ago. Today I found him working in a sit-in coffee shop I was trying out since I moved.
Maybe just smile and say hello. Or give him a hug, no words. You don’t have to make him have a chat about his mental health which might trigger things to just show him you’re really happy to see he’s doing well.  
I talked a teen jumper down from the rail on the bridge 4 1/2 years ago. Today I found him working in a sit-in coffee shop I was trying out since I moved.
He reached out to you, I think perhaps the next time you see him smile, say it's good to see him and see what he says. This made my screen blurry.

This is heartwarming. Just raise your cup to him and wink next time you get your order. Lowkey acknowledgement. Strangers can be so kind.

It was polite of you not to say anything.  I'm wondering if the reason he wrote the note instead of outright saying something is because you didn't say anything.   Maybe he just felt awkward and writing that note was the only thing he could think of that wasn't too forward of an approach.   I would suggest next time you see him, ask him how he is.  Just say how are you.  If he says good, then there's your answer.  If he says more, than that means he's okay on talking to you.  Maybe even start slow.

Maybe just keep it simple, say you’re glad to see him, and let him take it from there.

What did you say to him to talk him down?  
What did you say to him to talk him down?  
iirc Something along the lines of:  "Buddy, what'r you doing?" -He was crying. That is what attracted me to his location- Through the sobs, he said some personal stuff I won't repeat.  I asked why was going to use a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I asked him who would be sad about his death. I was pretty much rambling, I didn't even know what to say. I was just talking out my ass. He stepped off, stared at my face for a minute, and walked away. I tried to follow him, but he went into the subway and disappeared.

You did a great thing for him! I know it’s not easy to do.  I talked down a guy on the other side of a railing of an overpass above the interstate. He was drunk and likely homeless. It was a similar conversation, but not as good of an end result. Looked up his name from the police report 5 years later and he drank himself to death within a couple years. I guess, at the least he didn’t kill anybody in the traffic below the overpass.

Thank you so much for what you did. Eleven years ago my 14 year old son hung himself. Not only did you save this boy’s life, but you also saved his parents from the worst psychic pain imaginable.

Wow, this is so nice! I think you can say hello and tell that it's great to see him. Or maybe leave a sticky note written that. You shouldn't pressure him to talk to you though, if he wants to talk he will take action.

Quick question, did you talk him off the ledge by saying something like... “I wish you would step back From that ledge my friend You could cut ties with all the lies That you've been living in”

Because he reached out to you, I would organize somewhat what to say and definitely go back and approach him. He recognized you and reached out, if you approach him in a vulnerable, authentic way and say what's in your heart, he would definitely respond to that because he already opened himself up to you. I think it would help to cement the care you had for him, and let him know that you are truly happy, and always wished him well, I think it's healthy and it'll warm your hearts

I would think that a simple “how are you doing these days?” Or some similar variant would probably be appropriate and I’m sure he’d be happy to say.

I've talked a few hundred people out of offing themselves. People that find themselves in that situation rarely find themselves in that situation only the once. Also, since they're prone to those emotions and behaviors, they're wildly unpredictable. Being all chummy and finding a friend within a suicide attempt is stuff that only works in the movies. My advice is to stay away. Source: 5+ years as a 911 call taker.

I talked 4 people out of suicide last year. Stressful year.... I've stopped helping as much since it was really bringing my own mental health down. Instead, I've been sending them to a friend of mine who's really good with these things. All 4 have moved on to better things, and since we only talked over the internet, while I like to believe they've moved on, I don't know for sure. I hope they're alright. Good job, and I hope your conversation goes well. Typical redditor fashion edit: Thank you kind stranger for my first ever award.

Late to the conversation.  Skimmed through top replies and it’s just amazing that people are one hundred percent sure of their suggestions... yet their suggestions are completely opposite from each other.  It’s really interesting to read.  “Absolutely ask him how he’s doing!  He initiated contact.” “Absolutely don’t talk to him. If he wanted to he would have.” Best of luck, OP. And good job.

It's great that you guys got to see each other again. I'm sure he has always wondered what became of you after you saved his life so this reunion was probably a big deal to him. What you could do is just speak to him as if you're very familiar with him next time. A simple "Hey, what's up?"  Or "Good Afternoon" while walking by him is fine. If he wants to initiate the conversation further then he will.

This! So many reasons to let it fall or not continue, you're living such a busy life. A lot of people complain that school is too much and too overwhelming without the kids and a job added in there. Online learning is a lot of work and takes discipline. Kudos.

Thank you! I wasn’t on planning to celebrate since my school isn’t selling the cap and gown until May and no one really suggested anything but now I’m planning on taking myself out to eat 😁

Assuming you’re not in the U.S., I hope you pick the most indulgent place you can possibly think of. Because that’s a fantastic accomplishment and you deserve it. (If you’re in the U.S., please don’t go out to eat. Instead maybe pick up your absolute favorite meal from your absolute favorite place, plus another for tomorrow. Because that’s a fantastic accomplishment and you deserve it.)

CONGRATULATIONS!! I'm working on my associates degree for business administration too and people could care less because I'm taking online courses. Oh well, you should be proud of yourself! Good luck to you and your future endeavors!

As long as the university is accredited, who cares if it's online?

To further reinforce this, the difference between your degree on a resume and a full on-campus one? There isn't one. You're doing great work!  
My thoughts exactly.  
Not to mention, pretty much ALL colleges are online right now! (congrats and good luck to both you and op!!)

Distanced learning is actually much, much harder for most people.  Not only do you not get direct feedback from classmates or professors, there's really no way to tell comparatively (to other students) how you're doing in the class or not.  I go through entire CPA modules not knowing how I'm doing until after I know how difficult the exam was or wasn't.  The psychology of this is exhausting.

Yes, my online classes were hit or miss among the upper level courses. Gen ed courses had lots of engagement (the online lab for biology was a riot), but my some of my upper level classes were more "learn on your own, message me during office hours with questions". Really fucked up Personal Income Tax.

I’m doing my associates online too and no one cares either, which is kinda funny because I’ve done college in person and online and I’ve actually found online to be much more challenging. But from one online person to another, I’m proud of you! Keep pushing!!

Online college degree programs have been part of classic college programs since before 2009,  accredited since before those programs became available online.  I have degrees from both on-campus and online programs, and must admit that online programs avoid on-campus politics, and bullsh*t.

Congrats! I also did not get a degree. I was discouraged from it by my religious family, and by the time I had financial independence, I was already working full time and couldn’t see fitting it into my schedule. I started taking classes earlier this year, easing my way back. You are my inspiration!

I’m proud of you!! I’m the only one on one side of the family, and me and a few cousins were the first on the other side. I don’t know what it’s like to be a student with children but I started late and graduated in my mid 20s, so I did have to fully support myself during and that was hard enough!! It was the hardest and most stressful thing I’ve ever done, and many people just won’t understand that. Amazing accomplishment and good luck with the next chapter of your education :)

Oh man, successfully getting through my 2-year, then eventual 4-year degrees is one of hugest deals to me in my life. Be proud of you and don't worry about what anyone thinks. It's what YOU think that matters. It's such a huge accomplishment especially with every you've had going on. Go get it, you'll never regret the sweat and stress and time you put into it. I sometimes think that had I gotten better support and had more stability growing up, I could have achieved so much more. Congrats to you, keep it up.

Congrats! I’m proud of you, stranger. That’s a lot of odds that were stacked against you, and you did it!  My husband recently graduated with his bachelors, and his family didn’t give a shit either. It broke my heart. His parents are right at the poverty line, and didn’t help with his college expenses at all. And when he told him he graduated, they literally both shrugged, and started talking about something else.  Some people don’t understand how fucking hard college is. By itself, it’s hard. But working full time and college is a nightmare. I imagine juggling children made it even more tricky. You’ve made it this far, my friend. Congratulations again!

Congratulations!  I am in a similar boat and graduated this semester at 42, but it was so anticlimactic that 19 Dec came and went w/o any fanfare or recognition from the university except for “we’ll see you in May for the graduation.”  Well at least we have our health, and that is much more than many can say going into the new year.

Congrats!! A lot of my friends started working right after high school without trying to get into college, but now after a while of them working they needed to feel more self-accomplished even though they don't need the degree. Increasing your selfworth is actually a huge step towards inner happiness, and if having a degree gives you that this is an amaizing thing. Fuck whoever else, you are the most important.

Congrats!! Paradoxically, the disadvantages that you overcame will now be a huge advantage, going forward - finding your inner voice and doing the work to make the life you want is a big deal. I've observed that women entering University classes later than usual were the most hard-working people in class, and did much better than the average, younger, and less self-directed students. So waste zero energy on worries about upgrading to Uni. Though I might upgrade an unsupportive spouse...😁

My partner is a first gen student from a poor family and we were just talking about the struggles that she had, similar to what you’re saying. And that’s without kids.

Congratulations!  Onward and upward!  Get satisfaction and motivation from yourself or right here.  :)  Keep going and hold dear your hunger for success. I finally learned not to seek approval or recognition from my family:  mom thought I spent 4 years in secretarial school if she cared at all. She said, "I know where you worked, just never knew what you did there."  My dad said, "Everyone is Calypsodweller's boss."   Tried to explain my vocation (IT) many times, but was dismissed with indifference.  My parents never understood or acknowledged I earned the same degrees as my brother and sister (parents paid for their schooling).  I'm just a bit bitter about it.  Fast forward, I retired early and have 2 homes and a boat (which I live on 6 months a year).  They sneer as though I shouldn't be successful at all.  Oh well.   Yay me. :) Yay you!!!

Outstanding. Continually bettering ourselves is one of the best things we can do. I'm proud of you.  
Got hearing aids today and cried because my cat purred
It is one of the best sounds. The sound of a content animal. May you have many more sonic revelations.

Thanks! I've had a few sonic revelations today, from trying to figure out what that clicking sound was in my car (the turn indicator) to hearing paper towel rip. It's been an emotional day!

Did you lost your hearing at 21 and never heard a turn indicator of a paper towel before?  
Did you lost your hearing at 21 and never heard a turn indicator of a paper towel before?  
When you don’t hear something for a long time, you forget. You get used to not hearing things. It’s not really about the specific sound - it’s the experience of being able to HEAR it. At first, all of the sounds of everyday life can be surprising, or even startling, and then delightful, because you CAN HEAR IT.  Think of it this way. How many times a day do people use their turn indicator, or paper towels? How many days a week, month, year? Daily, probably many times a day. Mundane. But if you did those things on mute for a decade, you’d get used to them that way. No sound, just like everything else. You’d get used to the turn signal being the flashing light only, the paper towel being only the texture of tearing it (ripping things with perforations is distinctive, even without hearing it), the cat being only the shape of the mouth when meowing, or the vibration against you when they cuddle up. That’s your normal.  And suddenly, there is an entirely new dimension. Maybe you’ve experienced it before, but if you asked me to remember anything that was typical and mundane when I was 20, I couldn’t tell you. I can’t remember the specific way my car’s turn indicator sounded. I can’t even remember using it, although I know I did. If my last time hearing a paper towel tear had been that year, I wouldn’t remember it now. Things fade with time, so when it happens again, it’s new and startling and you’re not used to it; that doesn’t normally happen! Wonder is abundant when you’ve lost a sense and then get it back. 🥰

This makes complete sense! Sounds are forgotten quickly and it takes a lot of effort to remember them. I have a couple of sentences fixed in my mind in the voices of lost loved ones and I remind myself of their sounds often so I can keep those memories. I wouldn’t make that effort for little sounds like a turn signal. This coming from a hearing person, but I think we would all have trouble remembering non important sounds after awhile.

For the car, do you mean the click-click-click sound you hear when you turn the ignition just before the engine starts? I believe that is the sound of the spark plugs firing to get the engine going. I'm quite deaf myself and I don't think I was able to hear it properly until I got my most recent set of hearing aids. The technology has improved a great deal over the past decade.

It is the (left or right) turn signal. Click-clack click-clack click-clack....

Spark plugs don't make any sound notable outside the engine. If you hear clicks it's likely some relays you hear (electromagnetic switches that have a typical clicking noise). In fact, that's also what makes the indicator sound.

When my son first got his hearing aid we were in the kitchen and he was like "what's that noise?" took us a while to find it was the dishwasher, it had always run silently to him before. Have fun finding the new things! It's like a subs treasure hunt.

Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.  
My cat makes a quiet little sign/meow when she relaxes. Like someone going 'ahh' when they take their shoes off after a long day, but in cat trill form. It's very cute.  
Immediately preceding the plop of their head on your arm or leg... I love it. It also means I really can't move for a few hours.  
Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.

Think of it as an Early Warning System, the sound travels faster than the fart. But then you get complacent. It's the fart you don't hear coming that smells the worst.

It's such a great sound isn't it?  I live with two cats, one is my roommates cat that purs 24/7, and then my cat, that only puts on occasion when she is super happy.  Best sounds.

My uncle was once looking after a stray and called my grandmother in a complete panic saying they had to take the cat to the vet because it kept making this strange sound and twitching  My grandmother eventually figured out that “mike, it’s purring!!! That means it’s happy!!!”  
Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.  
If you surprise them when they’re sleeping, mine will make a little “mrrrrp” sound. That and the chirping at birds are my favorite cat sounds.  
Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.

I foster cats for cats protection. Cats purr for several reasons: 1) they do it when they are sick as it helps with healing 2) they also do it when they feel comfortable and safe and secure. Hope the last one made you cry in a good way.  
Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.  
Cute cat! Not sure about Kipper, but I've had cats that chirp like squirrels, meow happily when you pet them, cry and hiss because they're potentially tone def/don't understand the meaning of it, chirp to attract birds for prey (even though the bird was on the other side of glass), and groan because they're grumps. So look out for all those sounds cause they have more than one meow.  
Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.  
Sometimes they make a cute little startled noise if you wake them up or something, too.  I'm so happy for you and your sweet kitty ❤️  
Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.  
Cats make loads of diverse sounds so listen to your cat for the next while :) They meow, purr, trill, yell, snore and sneeze. They really talk to you and it makes them even more adorable.  
Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.  
Wow!  Thanks so much for your story.  Really put a smile in my heart.  And I agree...I think a cat purring is one of the most wonderful sounds in the world.  So glad you can enjoy this and many other sounds.  Now find a baby to tickle and make him/her laugh!🤗  
Give your good kitty pets for me, what a touching story  
I take sound for granted. My cat purring is one of the nicest sounds I've ever heard. I'm glad you get to experience that now!  
Got hearing aids today and cried because my cat purred
Have you heard a purr/ meow yet? Those are my favorite!! Also keep an ear out for the purring even when he isnt getting pets. My old cat could be heard purring as she walked down the hallway towards my room to get on the bed and snuggle. Purring just from the excitement of knowing she was about to get some good snuggles. I feel like hearing the purring adds to the emotional connection I make with my cats. I know they are enjoying something and that makes me enjoy it too.

Wait, what's a purr/meow? They can do both together? I'm sobbing again. I'm still trying to understand that purring isn't just a vibration thing they do and that it has a noise too. You're saying they can purr and meow at the same time? Do they still vibrate? I'm literally mind blown right now.

I'm not sure how to describe it. If you go on youtube and lookup "cats talking to each other" there is a video of a black/white cat and a white/tabby sitting next to each other literally going back and forth with meows and purr meows. I would link the video but my husband is sleeping next to me and I dont want to accidentally wake him up.

Oh wow. I put my hearing aids back in so I could watch this. I think my brain hasn't caught up to what my ears are hearing because it sounds robotic and tinny. I googled it and I guess it's pretty common for people with hearing loss. My brain isn't used to those sounds so it doesn't sound natural. I hope that makes sense.

The cat start up noise!! My baby doesn't purr but he does the surprise start up noise when I wake him from a dead sleep to tell him how cute he is.  I'm so glad you can hear these now!! This is such a pure post.  Also subtle soothing noises: the sound of pages turning, of rustling sheets, of a kettle about to boil, of a slow river bubbling.

Yay thank you!!! I'm sonexckted for OP to watch this. Cutest thing ever.  
Wait, what's a purr/meow? They can do both together? I'm sobbing again. I'm still trying to understand that purring isn't just a vibration thing they do and that it has a noise too. You're saying they can purr and meow at the same time? Do they still vibrate? I'm literally mind blown right now.  
Mine does it when he jumps up on the bed/sofa when I'm on it. Like he's excited to see me and is saying hello :) This is the sweetest post I've read in a long time, congrats on getting your hearing back!

To be clear. That does depend on the cat. My cat doesn’t do much purr meowing, but what he does do is different levels of purring. Sometimes it’s just a soft purr. But sometimes it’s a very loud purr which is when he’s most happy.

This made me so happy, I’m so glad for you!  
Thank you. I keep crying and feel so silly. It was so overwhelming and I'm still trying to process the sound. It's like my brain hasn't made the connection yet but my heart just knew that was his purr.

It's not silly. Hearing something so pure like a cat purring for the first time is amazing

now I'm crying with you, I really do take such simple sounds for granted. tomorrow I'm gonna go into my back yard & just listen.  if you havent yet, open the windows tomorrow morning & hear the sounds of birds in the distance, & maybe your cat will chirp too! (it's a funny noise if you haven't heard it from your boi yet!!)  
And I'm sobbing again. I haven't even thought about that sound in years. I wonder how long it's been since I heard leaves rustling.  
Cat purrs are amazing! So glad you experience it! Morning bird call chorus is pretty awesome. Open your window around sunrise.

I work in music and sound design and hearing loss is one of my constant fears. This story makes me happy. There’s so much more to hear and notice now! Edit:  -I have thought about this all day and I have come up with a few sounds that I really enjoy.  -When you step in snow a day after its fallen -When the snow starts to melt off of the branches as it gets warmer it kind of trickles down all around you -There is a type of sand like in Sarasota Florida and it kind of has a rubbery sound when you step on it -Letting the steam out of a iron, or when you coffee is brewing and bubbling -Bacon sizzling or then you open in egg onto a hot pan.. shhhhhhhhss -Definitely a small stream, or river is a favorite of mine -Putting your ear to someones chest and hearing their heart as well as their stomach making weird sounds -The wind whistling -The birds tweeting -Pouring a hot cup of tea (believe it or not they have done studies and people can hear if water is cold or hot when being poured) -Stepping in leaves in fall -A campfire is an amazing sound! -Sissors cutting through paper -Very slowly tearing paper -Walking on wet gravel or tires driving on wet gravel -Ocean Waves -When you put ice in a beverage and they start to crack -Walking on ice as it cracks (not on a lake but a puddle) -Cats purring for sure -Flipping the pages of a book -Cracking the spine of a book -Fluffing your blanket in in the air so its opens an lands on your bed (cats like this too) -An old wooden door or old latches -Cutting an apple, also most food sounds are great -Matches striking is great -Someone inhaling a cigarette or smoking a cigar, that kind of sizzle -Rain on a windshield -Certain zippers on a jacket sound great -Wind quietly blowing through grass I feel like from your post it is probably sounds that are low in frequency and in volume that will stand out to you. Like purring. Which was hard for me to think of sounds that are specific to that range. If you every want to hear a specific sound you can dm me. I have tons of recordings.  Also to others, I am very careful with my hearing and always have some hearing protection with me.

Thank you! I can only wear them for about thirty minutes at a time before I get too overwhelmed because everything has a sound. It’s like I can see the space around me, but with my ears.

I never got used to them and use them not so often as I should. But the suddenly hearing sounds you didn't know about or had forgotten is indeed wonderful!

I don’t know where you live, but one of my favorite sounds is fully leafed trees blowing in the wind. The rustle sound. If it’s winter there like where I am it’s something you can look forward to this summer 😊

Have you ever been among pine trees on a windy day? It’s the most softly mesmerizing “shish shish” sound; nothing like it.

It takes some time until your mind learns how to properly interpret  the change in audio input. The mind uses the input from the ears to map what is, and what happens, around you. With the boost from hearing aids, your mind needs to adjust how it maps. When I got my first hearing aids, I was constantly surprised that something I thought was right behind me turned out to be several meters away when I turned to look. So there was a mismatch between what my ears and my ears told me, and this was a cause of confusion and dizzyness. It will pass in a few days, if you wear the hearing aids at all times (except when sleeping or showering etc). In the meantime, take it easy. Sit down when the world threatens to start spinning. If it does not pass, the hearing aids should likely get adjusted. In my case it was 2-3 adjustments (with several weeks for acclimatisation in between) before they worked well. That being said, I too was moved to tears several times back in the day...when I got home from getting the hearing aids, and birds were singing. When I first listened to music after getting them. Good luck, and don't give up on the hearing aids just because it takes time to adapt!

Also 31F wearing hearing aides chiming in: you will get used to it, but give it time. Be patient with yourself, and expect to be more tired from your brain getting all this new input. I'll also second the recommendation of getting them adjusted if it doesn't work out within reasonable time. I also had Mike adjusted a couple of times.  Good luck!

Don't go too loud for long periods of time. Use ear protection/earplugs, the newer ones automatically adjust the sound level. Regular checkups (2-3 times a year, maybe more often because of your profession) at your otorinolaringologist.  Also, avoid sudden bursts of loud noise. I was at a historical festivity this last weekend and noped the fuck out when I saw firing cannons was involved.

u/vurtdurfurk I am so happy for you! If you ever want to explore some more sounds, here are some calmer ones I think anyone might enjoy :) Pleasant natural sounds: Soft trickling water from a small stream. The crackle of a fireplace. The laughter of your loved ones. The ambience around a calm lake with the sound of birds in the distance echoing off the placid water. Oddly enough the sound of silence on a still winter night in the country. As you noted, everthing has a sound, so sometimes going to the middle of nowhere and actively listening to nothing is so refreshing.  Pleasant musical sounds: The sound a cello makes. The sound of a string quartet playing a slow harmonious legato passage. A simple synth pad with long attack and release that fades in and out. The sound of artificial reverb (and then realizing the world has natural reverb all around you and focusing on that). The sound of raw emotion from a musician playing passionately (you'll know it when you hear it and you'll see it in their body language). The warmth and presence of a sub bass that you can both hear and feel in your chest at the same time.

If your cat sees birds from a window sometimes they chirp ! It’s like a repetitive short meow sound , I recommend trying to see if your cat does it or looking for a video online !!

That's so awesome! My brother is going to bring over a Tibetan singing bowl for me to listen to for the same reason. I'm so nervous to hear one!  
My hearing loss is in the bass frequencies, which means that high pitched ringing noises are completely ruined in my hearing aides. I can't stand those ringing sounds and once had a meditation guide stop using the bowl, and I have to leave the kitchen when the microwave is about to beep etc. I'm hoping your hearing aid settings are different, but just a heads up.

Also fizzy drink! She flipped out when she heard the bubbles! And the birds. Just EVERYTHING. It was like seeing someone experience life again for the first time. I’m gonna tell my mum about this and I know she’ll be just as excited for you. Enjoy ALL the sounds! Xxx

You're brain will eventually adjust. I wear only 1 hearing aid for Meniers disease, and walking out of the audiologist office, I heard things in stereo again. Hard to explain, but birds chirping I noticed immediately as well as all the noises in my car.  My hearing loss is mild but with it only in 1 ear, it is very disorienting. The hearing aid substantially helps with drowning out the nonstop ringing in my ear, but nothing helps the horrible vertigo associated with the disease or the intense ear aches. The loss of hearing is just one of the many side effects of Meniers. I suggest aids to everyone with hearing loss. I am only 45 and have no shame in wearing it. Nobody can even see it. As another poster mentioned, I am also a musician and losing my hearing is horrifying. I would gladly give up my eyesight to keep my hearing. I've seen enough. Except when you see videos of hearing impaired children hear their first sounds with aids. I love seeing that!

Thank you. Really was so heart-warming. I want to put my hearing aids back in and pet him and make him purr, but my brain is a little overwhelmed right now from all the other sounds too.

I'm deaf from the beginning of my life, and I just want  to know how real ears hear. (15M)  
I'm deaf from the beginning of my life, and I just want  to know how real ears hear. (15M)  
This is a really interesing statement, and I am going to *try* to describe some everyday sounds using non-sound words. The rustle of fabric (like when you pull a shirt on, or move the blankets on your bed): It's a warm sound; like being by a fireplace or when you get that rush of air out of the oven. It sounds like the way a wave looks as it slumps into the wet sand. It's the sort of noise you hear all the time but don't pay attention to - sort of like how you don't pay attention to the concrete on the footpath. It makes your brain feel like it's actually being caressed itself, the sound so unimposing that it just is happening without you realising, and when you do think about it, it's very comforting. The sound of a happy laugh: This one is intoxicating. Even more so if it's someone you love that is laughing (bonus if you've made the joke they're laughing at). It sounds like fizzy coca-cola, like your body is being dipped in warm butter. You get sparks in your brain like looking at amazing artwork or eating chocolate. It's like someone rubbing your head with a balloon and you're getting static electricity, but in your ears. The sound of fireworks: Each firework makes its own sound, to be fair. Some sound like when you get a shock from the car door - just small but it gives you a jolt. Some are full-on all body BANGS like if someone sneaks up behind you and gives you a fright. Some make a long noise at first, like the feeling of a finger running down your arm, finishing in a gentle but hard pinch. It's very exciting to hear them, but I promise seeing them is far better. ​ I hope someone else can provide better descriptions of sounds, but that's my attempt at three. :)  
This is a really interesing statement, and I am going to *try* to describe some everyday sounds using non-sound words. The rustle of fabric (like when you pull a shirt on, or move the blankets on your bed): It's a warm sound; like being by a fireplace or when you get that rush of air out of the oven. It sounds like the way a wave looks as it slumps into the wet sand. It's the sort of noise you hear all the time but don't pay attention to - sort of like how you don't pay attention to the concrete on the footpath. It makes your brain feel like it's actually being caressed itself, the sound so unimposing that it just is happening without you realising, and when you do think about it, it's very comforting. The sound of a happy laugh: This one is intoxicating. Even more so if it's someone you love that is laughing (bonus if you've made the joke they're laughing at).

I have hearing aids, so I hear most of these sounds :) I don't know if there is a word for in English, but without hearing aids I hear very little sounds

You will get so much joy in the coming days, weeks, months..........  My dad is a vet, he got hearing aids, when he walked out of the VA....... He says, “Oh wow, I can hear the birds chirping!” So sweet! But does he wear them? No. Sadly, no. He says they hurt his ears, and whine, and he’s a stubborn old fart. Set in his ways. You have to yell at him on the phone so he can hear, and his tv is always on blast level. But I love him. Lol I’m so happy for you! Thank you for your service and sacrifice! We got a kitten a while back, and I’ve never had a cat before, so I totally understand that! Lol What a sweet happiness. Listen to see if you can hear your children’s heartbeats. Or tummy growls. Pressed against them. Just so happy for you!

Can he go back and get them refitted? If they hurt his ears and they whine, is that normal? I can’t imagine wanting to wear that myself.  
Can he go back and get them refitted? If they hurt his ears and they whine, is that normal? I can’t imagine wanting to wear that myself.  
Sadly normal but not proper. Hearing aids should never hurt. The whining means that either 1) the ear pieces don't fit properly, leaking sound which creates feedback, or 2) the hearing aids are turned up too high, most likely in the high frequencies, for what the ear pieces can handle. Depends on the individual ear shape/hearing curve. Easily fixed by an audiologist with some patience.

This is so sweet!! I’m hard of hearing and wear hearing aids in both ears. I had a similar experience when I got my first pair! I kept hearing tires hitting the pavement while my parents were driving or when I heard rain for the first time  and it was a whole new world! Different sounds will continue to amaze you, enjoy it!  It’s such a cool experience! So exciting 💕

Thank you! I've been amazed at quite a few sounds I didn't know I was missing. I forgot when you rip paper towels they actually make a rip sound. I heard the fan in the living room. I can hear the clock above my desk ticking. Turns out I have no idea how to whisper. My own voice sounds so strange. Consonants sound strange. The water running in tub when I was giving my kid a bath sounded so loud. I can't wait to hear more tomorrow!

Oh my goodness!! I relate so much! I’m TERRIBLE at whispering 😂 honestly hopeless with it. I remember I heard certain frequencies more than I did before, so, I could hear the air conditioning fan but not the microwave. It’s such a cool sound experience to figure out!!

Kitty purrs are some of the most precious sounds. It is so wonderful that you’ve finally gotten the chance to hear what they sound like.  
Got hearing aids today and cried because my cat purred
I love this so much! Congratulations on your new hearing aids! Purring is such an amazing, odd noise I and I found out my little sister (not blood related but she’s still my little sis) both can make a purring noise. c: (aside from the way you roll ‘r’s.) I looked it up, some say the frequency of a cats purring can heal promote healing and bone density. Cats make all kinds of noises (I’ve lived with at least one cat at all times of my life and my cats still surprise me sometimes) one of ours sounds like he says, ‘mama’, I love it. Give your kitty a pet for me please. Thank you for sharing your story!

My purr machine Rosie and I say hello and enjoy the purrs!

My sister has been hard of hearing since birth. She was born with Spina Bifida as well as severe hearing loss. I still remember the day she got her hearing aids. I cried more than her. I was at work, eating lunch, when she called me. I cried for 2 hours after that.  I can't imagine the feeling from actually hearing a cat purr. I have 7. Listening to them purr makes my heart flutter.  I'm so thankful you get to experience sound now.

Also, watch your cat’s tail when they are stimulated in a positive way(like being fed or greeting you at the front door)...their tail vibrates quickly.

I learned a new one recently. Trilling. I think most (or all) cats do it, but I didn't know what it was called until I happened upon a YouTube video (what else lol) that identified it. If you don't know what it is, search trilling or cat trilling on YouTube. 😊

I used to never be able to hear cats purring. But then I got new hearing aids and I can hear them now! There were so many things I didn’t know made noise, like the leaves rustling, the sound of fabric, the sound of kicking a soccer ball. My favourite new sound is definitely a cats purr. It’s so beautiful, and so rare.

This story reminds of when I got my hearing aids about 4 years ago. I have been HOH ever since I was born but my parents never knew it until about 5 years ago. I remember being excited to get my hearing aids and my Audiologists did some testing on me and the hearing aids then handed them to me. I put them on and just got teary eyes all of the sudden. I got up and walked around and I heard my footsteps for the first time ever. I have never heard my own footsteps clearly and it was just amazing knowing they can be so loud lol. Anyways, it doesn’t seem like that big of a thing but it was for me.

Dearest OP, What is your precious cats name?  I hope the connection between what you (once) felt, and heard today, will forever resonate in your soul. I am 52 years young, and have neglected my hearing for 20 of those years. With that said, I have learned to lip read to the best of my ability, and, have been honing in on my sign language skills that I once studied. With that said, I am grateful for the hearing that you now have. 💜 Nothing compares to the *sound of a cat purring. Or, the *feeling of the vibrations... I wish you a 'meow~rific' life. Add biscuits, and life is gouda. X

Omg that’s so beautiful I’m tearing up just reading it!!! Whenever im feeling sad or stressed out I always snuggle up to my cats and put my ear to their little bodies and just fill my head with the sound of their purring.

Got hearing aids today and cried because my cat purred
So you’re saying you had no idea what purring was or sounded like before the age of 21. Not buying that.  I had no idea cats made that sound  You’ve only had hearing issues for 10 years and are 31. None of this rings true.  
Got hearing aids today and cried because my cat purred
You started losing your hearing at 21 and never heard a cat purr before then? EDIT: Never owned a cat before either. It seems crazy that you had never heard a cat purr in your life until now. You never heard it in a tv show or movie? Nothing on youtube? Never? I'm sure you had a sweet moment but color me skeptical about the details.

Had a friend of mine who was red/green color blind. Hebhad a few issues a while back when he worked for a commercial networking(I think) company who'd use red spray paint to make where the lines were or needed to go, especially on the lawn. Needless to say it didn't take long for them to switch to him to a different job until they got in yellow paint.

The first question is what we're actually talking about when we say "the upvote arrow." Are we talking about the upvote button on the original reddit design (old.reddit.com) or on the redesign (reddit.com)? Because they're different colors. Here are the original arrow and the new arrow, side-by-side (old on left, new on right). Next, which part of the arrow? It's not a single solid color. Here's a blown-up view of the previous side-by-side. Let's assume that we're talking the color at the very heart of the arrow. For the old design, that's #ff8b60. For the new design, that's #ff4500.   So the new design is absolutely orange red, agreed.   The old upvote button, on the other hand, isn't orange red. So what color would we describe #ff8b60 as? According to the Color Name & Hue Picker the hue is "Orange" and the color is:    Atomic Tangerine

According to the Color Name & Hue Picker the hue is "Orange" and the color is:    Atomic Tangerine  
I want you to know I appreciate the effort you put into this  
The first question is what we're actually talking about when we say "the upvote arrow." Are we talking about the upvote button on the original reddit design (old.reddit.com) or on the redesign (reddit.com)? Because they're different colors. Here are the original arrow and the new arrow, side-by-side (old on left, new on right). Next, which part of the arrow? It's not a single solid color. Here's a blown-up view of the previous side-by-side. Let's assume that we're talking the color at the very heart of the arrow. For the old design, that's #ff8b60. For the new design, that's #ff4500.   So the new design is absolutely orange red, agreed.   The old upvote button, on the other hand, isn't orange red. So what color would we describe #ff8b60 as? According to the Color Name & Hue Picker the hue is "Orange" and the color is:    Atomic Tangerine  
After messing around with Python and PIL, here's the number of pixels per color:   2 #6e2e16   2 #7d3014   2 #8e3311   5 #9c350f   2 #9e360f   5 #a4370e   5 #ac380d   2 #af380c   5 #b4390c   5 #bb3a0a   2 #bf3b0a   1 #c13b0a  13 #c33c09  11 #cb3d08   2 #cf3d07   9 #d33e07   7 #db3f05   5 #e34104   3 #eb4203   1 #f34302  Probably should have converted to HSL...  
You can find the color in DevTools if you are using Chrome for example. Right click on an upvoted upvote arrow > inspect > Find tab 'computed' next to 'styles', then you'll see the exact color ( in RGB probably, in this case it is RGB 255, 69, 0 ). You can also use it to find which fonts are used on any webpage for example  
69 nice

Idk that looks darker than the upvote button color  
Are you dark mode or light mode? On mobile that looks exact to me.  
Idk that looks darker than the upvote button color  
Perhaps it's different on new reddit. Old reddit uses the image from this spritesheet which is #ff8c61 at the outline tip and #ff8b60 just inside. It's undeniably orange.

You can literally check using a photo editor...  
Idk that looks darker than the upvote button color  
Also it depends on the ambient surrounding color. That can play tricks on your brain. If you have Reddit in night mode or light mode the upvote may appear darker or lighter whem compared to a larger color swaft with the picture shown above.  
It's #ff4500, so literally orange red. Everybody wins!  
Came here to say this! Even checked it with an eyedropper tool in Paint :-)

People used to always call it "orangered." I haven't seen the term as much in the past few years, and instead an increasing amount of debates over whether it's orange or red. What happened to the peace and knowledge we once had? Orangered is the "official" term anyway, when they divided for April Fools some years ago it was orangered and periwinkle.

I want you to know two things.   I’m team periwinkle I thought ‘orangered’ was a made up Reddit word like the past tense of the verb to make something more orange than it was previously, as if a single upvote rendered a post orange, a second would make it oranger. And then ‘oranger’ was Reddit hq slang for updooting. And finally they would say “did you see how I orangered (orange-urd) that post?”

The Problem with Immortality
I believe there was a Twilight Zone? with this theme. The guy made big plans. He was going to become a better painter then DaVinci. A better musician than Bach. A better author than Shakespeare. He had all the time in the world to hone his skills. But he mostly procrastinated and never did anything. Because he had all the time in the world.

There is another Twilight Zone episode that I saw recently about immortality. A hypochondriac man made a deal with the devil to be immortal and invincible. He got himself hurt in all sorts of ways (like getting hit by a bus and a train) and collected the compensation money. He wanted to see if the electric chair, aka the death sentence, would do anything to his body, plus by now he was super bored with life without pain, as he was a hypochondriac before and his health was all he cared about. So he killed his wife. He wanted to be sentenced to death, but was instead sentenced to life in prison because the lawyer was good at his job. He knew his life would never end and couldn’t bear the idea of an immortal life in prison, so he got the devil to come back and thus his soul was now the devil’s.  Very interesting take on immortality. In this episode, it focused more on boredom being what broke him. Since there was no end to life, he basically had nothing to life for. I haven’t seen the episode you described but I love the Twilight Zone and probably will someday!

I haven’t seen the episode you described but I love the Twilight Zone and probably will someday!  
If he wanted the death sentence and his lawyer got him life in prison, that's a bad lawyer.  
There is another Twilight Zone episode that I saw recently about immortality. A hypochondriac man made a deal with the devil to be immortal and invincible. He got himself hurt in all sorts of ways (like getting hit by a bus and a train) and collected the compensation money. He wanted to see if the electric chair, aka the death sentence, would do anything to his body, plus by now he was super bored with life without pain, as he was a hypochondriac before and his health was all he cared about. So he killed his wife. He wanted to be sentenced to death, but was instead sentenced to life in prison because the lawyer was good at his job. He knew his life would never end and couldn’t bear the idea of an immortal life in prison, so he got the devil to come back and thus his soul was now the devil’s.

there is another one where the guy makes a bat suit and fights crime but he isnt immortal and its not the twilight zone it is a movie called batman  
I believe there was a Twilight Zone? with this theme. The guy made big plans. He was going to become a better painter then DaVinci. A better musician than Bach. A better author than Shakespeare. He had all the time in the world to hone his skills. But he mostly procrastinated and never did anything. Because he had all the time in the world.  
Another core problem with the idea of completing all your hobbies and aspirations is that humans hate failure. Id love to master dovetail joints, for instance, but I haven't because I don't feel like powering through hours to years of failure first. I could do that for a few things in life, but only the things that REALLY call out to me. Long term, I bet that problem would only be amplified, especially because you can always get started tomorrow anyway.

Incidentally, $1 at 5% interest for 1000 years would give you a total of $1,546,318,920,732,876,472,320.00. After the first 100 years you'd only be at $131.50 but after that it really starts to snowball. (Assuming no other fees, not counting for inflation or the various ways in which doing this would destroy civilization etc.)

Interesting fact, several central banks in very stable countries like Germany are starting to pay negative interest. If that seems strange, it's because of a phenomenon like the one this story hints at. If you have more people willing to invest than people willing to borrow, then you need to pay banks to hold your money in a secure spot. Banks can only offer interest if they are earning money as well. In the case of our immortal hero, he needs to pay someone to maintain his money for him (assuming currency and civilization as we know it continues to exist after 1000s of years).  For me the most interesting part of the story is what he does once the basics are covered. If you didn't have to work, and had done everything cool in the world, what would you dedicate your life to? Religion? Politics? Breeding on a mass scale? Trying to get humans into space to preserve our race forever?

Even getting to space only delays the inevitable, and not by long in the grand scheme of things.

Exactly, what human think about as forever comes nowhere near the trillions of years into the future, of a dark homogeneous universe that is being projected here.

The likelihood of the currency still having value after 1000 years is doubtful.

100%.  If any form of immortality were possible in the world as we know it, I'm sure many of us would pursue it-- but not without the option to self-destruct.  There are too many possible hells.

Death is not a disease. It is your body not recreating itself as effectively over time. So perhaps you could make yourself live longer but that does not mean you can't get hit by a car and survive when you walked out the lab with your solution to aging.

Yeah but since you’re already immortal that means that there has to be some scientific way of recreating that.

Death is a disease, or at least aging. It's degeneration of DNA. If we could find a way to stop or reverse that we could be biologically immortal.

Death not being considered a disease is a social thing. Aging has its causes and those can be prevented, or eventually they will I believe.

No one actually die of "old age". And a growing amount of research is point to exactly that, that if you can cure all the other diseases and break downs you cure death.

So now you're floating in space continually freezing and suffering pain for billions of years. That doesn't sound like a smart plan.  
The Problem with Immortality
I remember reading this a while back,  and i think my answer to it remains the same as ever.  It'd be worth the boredom to get to see where humans eventually go.  Do we expand into the rest of the solar system? Do we restructure earth to a saveable point? Do we attempt inter system travel for colonization? Do we make it at all? We'll probably never know, and to me thats worse than eventually floating in space as an insane goober. Edit: I just wanna say that there's a remarkable amount of people who take issue with what I want or dont want in this imagined scenario. Yall are repeating the same things. Yeah,  infinites a long time. Oh well,  its better than being straight dead and nonexistant anymore.

It is scary to think we will never know the future. We can reach so far into the past and learn such minute details, but we can never know anything beyond our own lifespan. It's a shame really I'd really like to know where this is all going.

Best bet? Simulation theory. When we die we unplug the controller and just are a bunch of bored, fourth dimensional, beings. After all wouldn't playing life be boring if you knew it was a game?

 After all wouldn't playing life be boring if you knew it was a game?  Damn, that sounds like a tail twist ending line from a movie. But again if you play a game where you don't know that it is a game, then you would live your life as you would in real life and then there is no point of playing in the first place. Unless this fourth dimensional world is inherently more boring than a third dimensional one.

I disagree. If I knew if life was a game I'd do crazy shit. I'd be fucking crashing cars into shop fronts and robbing banks and shit. Pure take a load of drugs and go skydiving. That would be much better.

You see, that's what the first iterations of the game of "life" would be like. The sandbox, sims/gta3 iterations. But as we get bored of having too much control, we look to more complex, harder, and probably more interesting versions of the game. Maybe one much more random and less in our control?

I always think the worst thing about dying is that you don’t get to find out what happens and how it ends. Not even necessarily what happens to humanity or the universe overall, but just like... what happens to the people you know that are still alive, what happens in the next election, that sort of thing. That’s the part that makes me sad, and the part that is so frustrating. I don’t really think there’s an afterlife the way that most people think of heaven (where people can look down on their loved ones), but I really, really hope I’m wrong and will be in for a nice surprise in the other side :)

The real problem is, if the universe destroys itself and is reborn again, which is a theoretical possibility, you would witness this happen to humanity, then you would forget it happened after several iterations of the universe without humans, then eventually you would get to see it happen again, except by then you won't have memory pf concept of caring about humans. This will happen an infinite number of times.

you have finite memory so at some point it would seem new again

Honestly I would quite like it if the universe recreated itself but different after a 20-30 billion years and I was immortal. It means I could never run out of new stuff to find and do.

Wouldn't it become Minecraft-style infinite then eventually, always new but always the same?

 It'd be worth the boredom to get to see where humans eventually go.   No, it wouldn't be worth it. Unless you have SOME way to kill yourself at the end, to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride, it would absolutely not be worth it. We're not talking about a long timespan. We're talking about ETERNITY. On your immortal timescale, the entire lifetime of the Earth is gone in the blink of an eye. You can hardly even comprehend it, that's how short it is. The sun expands and Earth is gone, engulfed in flames. HOPEFULLY at this point you've moved off-Earth or joined some alien intergalactic civilization. Otherwise, you're going to be floating in space (or sitting on the burnt-out husk of the Earth) for a very very long time. No matter what happened to you, though, eventually, your civilization will die out. All civilizations will die out as entropy approaches its maximum value, and the available energy in the universe slowly spreads out in a perfectly uniform way. Eventually, you will be alone. So you might think, the boredom is worth it, because of all the cool shit you saw over the last billion billion years, right? Human spaceflight, alien civilizations, intergalactic empires, who knows. Awesome stuff. No. It's not worth it. EVERYTHING that you have experienced up until this point makes up merely 0.0000001% of your overall lifespan. Everything. The entire age of intelligent life in the universe, those billions and billions of years, they are TINY in comparison to the eons that you're about to experience. In fact, that percentage was wrong. It wasn't 0.0000001%. Because you are immortal, and time is eternal. So everything you previously experienced was more like... 0% of your total lifespan. Division by infinity always approaches zero. Consider that there is nobody to talk to. Nothing to do. Just you floating in empty space, existing as more-or-less the only "thing" in the universe, totally violating the laws of physics in every conceivable way. The stars have died out at this point, so there is no light - just black holes wandering the empty universe, merging and slowly evaporating. Eventually even they will evaporate via Hawking radiation, and it will just be matter and energy left behind, spread out in a perfectly uniform way. You're still alive at this point, by the way. And since your brain only contains a finite number of neurons to make memories with, you can't even remember your "old" and interesting life, the 0% of your lifespan where you had friends and family and alien bros. All you can remember is dark emptiness in the past, and all you can expect is dark emptiness in the future. And under our current understanding of physics, AFAIK, the universe will stay in this state. Forever. Maybe you can hope for some event to disturb you, for some random quantum fluctuation to cause a new Big Bang or some shit. But that's just a fleeting hope. For all we know, you would truly just stay there, forever and ever.  As far as I see it, the "boredom problem" is a fundamental problem with any afterlife that involves eternal life. This includes immortality, it includes heaven and hell. Really the only afterlife which offers a good solution is reincarnation, with your memory being wiped on each iteration.

Dont forget that after eons and eons later, every star will become a red dwarf, then turn into a black or brown dwarf. The universe will become dark filled with black holes and black dwarfs with no air to breath. If you touch a black dwarf, you will get trapped into an eternal gravitational pull.

Eventually the heat death of the universe will cause all matter to reach equilibrium. Thus the entire universe will be a uniformly dense soup. Except you, you immaculate human sized and shaped anomaly. You will cause minute amounts of chaos, interrupting the immense grey soup of the universe ever so slightly. Eventually you might cause enough change, amd enough of a butterfly effect that a new universe develops. Look at you, you instigator you :)

It would be nice if it worked like that, but it doesn't. The universe is expanding at an exponential rate. That means that eventually every single particle will be moving away from every other particle so fast that it is physically impossible for them to ever come into contact. In the end, all that will be left is an innumerable multitude of particles accelerating ever faster away from each other, destined to never come into contact with anything ever again, leaving the universe an utterly cold, dark, and lonely place where time is meaningless because nothing ever happens, and keeps on happening, forever.

There is no forever when nothing changes. How do you think the universe started? From some null state. So, what do you suppose will happen once the universe reaches another null state?  
The Problem with Immortality
This is exactly why I am afraid of immortality; I am already dreading life for the next 30, 40 years due to how the world is like currently and how connected we are as a single planet. There are days that I wished the world would end like the movie 'Finding A Friend For The End of The World', literally no salvation. It is interesting to see how people react differently to such news and honestly, it is not a bad way to go.

Same here. I don't do very much research, but there is quite a few catastrophic events that can happen within the next 30+ years, give or take a few maybe. I live in an area that's apparently overdue for an 9.0 earthquake that'll for sure kill me or at least leave me injured and I can't bring my mind around as to why people keep moving here. Lol We also have a few volcanoes that will likely blow their tops during this supposed earthquake. One of them is active and quite close to where I live.  That and Yellowstone is bound to explode within my lifetime and it's only like three states away from me. A few people have told me that the eruption can cause enough significant damage to wipe out thousands upon thousands of people, but who knows.  If I'm gonna die from some apocalyptic event, I just hope it's quick and I hope my family goes quick too. Shit is scary to even think about. EDIT: The Yellowstone part was wrong. It is not going to explode anytime soon. Please stop correcting me. Lol

I have a near constant anxiety about the future, and it's rekindled weekly as I read more grim news about the state of our biosphere. It makes it really hard to focus and stay motivated to keep working on things for the future.

Bound to explode in your lifetime? Bruh. It happens once every 600,000 years on average. Assuming you live to age 80, there’s a 0.013% chance of it happening in your lifetime. It’s far more likely that it won’t explode in your lifetime. It doesn’t matter that it’s “overdue.” That’s not how volcanoes (or earthquakes) work. It’s random. There’s a 1/600000 chance this year, 1/600000 chance next year, (599000/600000)80 in an average lifetime. You’re far more likely to die in the climate wars.  
Bound to explode in your lifetime? Bruh. It happens once every 600,000 years on average. Assuming you live to age 80, there’s a 0.013% chance of it happening in your lifetime.

Bruh, your math is wrong...(1/600000)80 is not the chance in an average lifetime lmao, it’s the chance than it will happen every year in an average lifetime. The chance it will happen once in an average lifetime is actually 1-(599999/600000)80, which, while small, is still significantly larger than what you proposed.  
This is exactly why I am afraid of immortality; I am already dreading life for the next 30, 40 years due to how the world is like currently and how connected we are as a single planet. There are days that I wished the world would end like the movie 'Finding A Friend For The End of The World', literally no salvation. It is interesting to see how people react differently to such news and honestly, it is not a bad way to go.  
Dreading life for 3-4 decades due to internal or external reasons?  If you're not trapped in your own body, you can change things.

Eventually, the immortals will drift together towards their collective center of gravity creating a slowly growing planet of immortals. Immortals lost to apathy will sink to the core of Immorta while the most sane/stubborn/crazy/powerful will eke out an existence, struggling to stay on top of the writhing surface of immortals who seek to drag them down and supplant their position of freedom, and striking a balance between eons of wisdom and a distinct lack of resources that aren't byproducts of the other immortals beneath them. This is now the setting for your next DnD time travel adventure. The land of Immorta has no external light source and no natural resources or features in the traditional sense. It is a roiling world of darkness spotted by small regions where powerful immortals have managed to control those beneath them and tap them for various sources of energy and materials. Some may use alchemy to produce new materials from the secretions of their subordinates. Others may bend all nearby to their will and use them directly as surfaces, structures, fixtures, and appliances. All surfaces not modified by a powerful immortal are active living bodies and are therefore considered difficult terrain.

Never played Warhammer but the concept you mentioned is fascinating. You or anyone else have an ELI5 plot summary?  
I'm really rough on 40k, but I'll give it a shot. 40k refers to the 401th millennium, like 2k=2000 refers to the 21th millennium, now. So far far in the future. So humanity's expanded among the stars, but there's this thing called the Warp, which is kind of like space, but also imagination. Like, that's where your soul is. And there's demons in the Warp, that can attack you, and Evil Gods, too, that go and corrupt people, and get evil cultists around them. At some point, the Warp became much closer to reality, I think the barrier thinned? So magic kind of stuff is possible, but there's nothing good in the Warp, only evil gods and demons, and temporarily people when they travel through the Warp. So it starts to break down advanced human society. (I think this is 30k stuff?) So this guy comes about, the God-Emperor, and goes on a crusade saving tons of human colonies through space, giving back order. After he's done with that, he goes back to Earth, but kinda half dies or something. So his corpse sits on his throne, with his soul protecting everyone through the Warp. So cultists can accurately say he's dead, and mindfuck people, but believers can believe in him, which protects them. And since the evil gods are real, a similar thing exists with the God-Emperor, in that all of humanity believes in him to stave off their own corruption. Human society still kinda degrades, though. Everyone is more or less religious fanatics of him, with the techies believing in a Machine God (who they've doublethinked themselves into believing that the Machine God is also the God-Emperor, to unify those groups). But the techies don't really know what they're doing. They're more like mages trying random shit and praying to machines and sometimes getting stuff to work. The God-Emperor's sons do stuff. I think one of them becomes corrupt or something. Certainly, though, they all can do better, because everything's kind of a shit show. Life basically sucks for everyone, and Inquisitors have free reign, and torture people and shit, but it's better than the alternative of the evil gods corrupting everything. Though some of the Inquisition are secretly working for dark gods. There's Space Marines, who've altered their bodies in some crazy ways to be super powerful. There's the Eldar, who are kind of like Space Elfs, I think, and they created their own shitty god, or something? Of course, since they have a closer connection to the Warp, and thus can do magic, they're kinda fucked up. There's space Orks, which kill all their enemies, do weird magic techy things, and survive through sheer stubborn stupidity. There's other shit, too. Basically, the entire fucking universe sucks, but the least sucky thing is to worship the God-Emperor. But that still sucks. Anyone want to correct me or improve my explanations?

Singular correction  emperor "died" killing one of sons to save humanity and is now kept alive by a fuckton of things on his throne and what not  Singular improvement  Orks can literally will something into existence to an extent if enough of them believe in it (i.e. red vehicles go faster)

To elaborate on your second point, because I think it is hilarious, orks have some latent psychic power and there is a theory that this power is what keeps the emperor alive because they believe he is alive. They think, therefore he is.

Ork spaceships have Windows that can open because they all wanted to be able to open a window and so they can and everything is fine. At one point humans captured an ork war machine and popped the hood to find it completely empty and devoid of machinery. Taped to the inside of the hood was a piece of paper with the word “enjin” on it.

Oh Im not an expert on WH40K and I wouldn't dare to begin to explain any better than the Wikipedia article.  However, if you just want to start splashing gleefully in the shallow end, I highly recommend Helsreach - a 13 (not 10) part animated adaptation of an audio book set in the WH40K canon (all on Youtube).... started off animated by Richard Boylan in black and white sketch form, then as he started working on it full time it kinda grew into its own thing. Its quite good. He just finished part 13 (final) a few months ago.  Whups, someone stitched all 2 1/2 hrs together.. yaay. Space Imperial Marines, Chaos Legion, Orcs, giant mechanicus pseudo religious priest templar stuff... its way cool.  
Never played Warhammer but the concept you mentioned is fascinating. You or anyone else have an ELI5 plot summary?  
Lots of sci-fi authors have gone at this. It usually boils down to either a) the biological limits of your brain are eventually overwhelmed by your immortal existence or b) because time and death lose meaning to an immortal almost everything else in life loses meaning as time and death define our reality.

hmm... Maybe I'd adventure into whatever realities are unlocked with the Theory of Everything. Maybe I'd find a true random existence where I'd effectively 'forget' everything I 'know' every so often.  I'd hit that reset button with my AI buddy or we would have a pact to do that to each other; keeping alive that novelty.  We would reincarnate via some periodic harmonic function.  Maybe that would be the same as dying and that'd be A'Ok with me.

So my understanding of immortality is that you won't die naturally, but you can still be killed. Kinda like a vampire.  Why do you see it differently

You are correct! Immortality and invincibility are two very different things.

I've never really been convinced by this argument because humans are terrible at conceiving time as well as their own mortality. I don't see how they'd be any different if immortality were involved. Seems to me the routines of life would seem no different than they do now. Life already feels infinite given the way our brains work.

They don't convince me because being immortal is such a foreign concept to us that we can't say for sure what would happen, it could go like OP said or a thousand different ways, the opportunities are infinite

I dunno man I literally get hair tearing out scared of death sometimes, it properly scares me. Mostly because of the eternal aspect of it and that it's a really long time being dead once you pass through that door. The only comfort I've conjured up is that "even immortals crave death eventually" because of all the things stated in op's post. We certainly do have a hard time conceiving time but also if thrust into immortality, any person could become so insane due to us as a species only having a good 80 years or so. Forever can be really boring, and lonely.

The Problem with Immortality
Beautiful story. But yeah, remember how the  "witches" in medieval England were dealt with? This case will be much , much worse. People will try to kill you, but since you can't die, they'll probably tear apart your body parts, one by one, until you pass out due to excruciating pain. When you wake up, you can't do anything forever until someone beyond jealousy puts you back together. Maybe I exaggerated, but not by much. That's what I think will happen when you have something that nobody has, and especially since you can cheat the system like investing money in banks. Otherwise, you will be a guinea pig for scientists and they will try to replicate your DNA, and by genetic engineering, everyone will be immortal in a few years. Thanks for reading my comment

I was going to raise a similar point. Even without other people trying to get at your body. OP memtioned hang gliding and cocaine, but even if you can't die, would you suffer injuries? If so, you could easily be crippled for life. Just a head. Or a brain detached from spinal cord and eyeballs and everything else. If no injuries, what about pain? Not being able to feel pain would also lock you out of a lot of things, from spicy food to BDSM. Also if no injuries, what separates injuries from good modifications of your body, like working out or eating healthier? Are you essentially stuck in your current body? And everyone seems to agree that emotions/mental state aren't affected--pain on losing family, etc.--so you could well be traumatized, or flat out insane like lots of people have mentioned already.

The Problem with Immortality
I would take up blacksmithing. I would travel the world learning every single ancient technique I could from every civilization. I would eventually become a god at the craft, able to make tools and weapons that would make men and women weep. I eventually learn how to make a sword so sharp is can cut two individual atoms apart. So hard, yet flexible it would withstand a nuclear blast. Given that I am Immortal I would fuse it to my arm so that I could never be disarmed. After this I would use it to enslave the human race. What would stop me? I could slice any military vehicle in half like they were soft butter.  After having my fun, and I am alone in the universe, I would turn it on myself. I would cut myself apart into thousands of pieces. My conciousness would split into so many pieces that my ability to interpret stimulation would overload. There I would float. Not dead but unable to grasp the fact I am alive. Not in pain, not awake. Unless of course my conciousness simply transfers to the last piece I have cut, in which case I will be a tiny speck of brain matter floating through the void for ever. That would suck. Edit: a word

The Problem with Immortality
And as you watch all of existence be birthed again in a single instant you smile to yourself and whisper, into the empty and yawning void, "round 2 i guess".     Life is a cycle, peaks and valleys and peaks again. You learn a little more each time. It changes a little more each time but now you're there from the beginning. You Shepard and you steward and now the new world is better and more beautiful than the old.  You become a gardener, suffering silently through the the winters of cosmic death only to watch your garden burst into life anew each beautiful and brilliant spring.

The Problem with Immortality
Not exactly casual, but I'll give it a go.  I've got a pretty rich imagination, and I've spent thousands of hours in bed with my eyes closed just thinking and imagining.  If I exist after the heat death of the universe, I'll have an infinity of that, and that seems pretty cool to me.  I don't really make attachments with people, and I won't miss them.  Not really interested in wealth.  But the real deal is What kind of immortality are we talking here? If you live forever but your body can still be mutilated (i.e. you don't grow back a severed arm) then I can see how it would start to suck as a few centuries of accidents built up and all you were left with was a torso and a head, but that's no different from the heat death problem anyway.  If you live forever and your body is invincible, the time humanity exists will be more fun but the heat death time will make that a past fading memory. And there is a lot more of that. If it's highlander style, then if things go to shit you can just get your head crushed.  Honestly, I'd defs go for immortality in almost every circumstance except maybe you live forever but your body ages. That'd suck for a while then you'd be dust and we're back to the heat death scenario.

Problems I see with every argument  "You'll have to watch everyone you love die." I'm going to do that anyway.  "You'll be alone." How? If immortality is possible all I have to do is replicate it, and if it is possible then it's likely happened before. Am I truly the only immortal being in all of existance? "You'll float in space forever." Sure, I might. The more likelihood is eventually I'd find my way to another planet. Even if painfully slow. The smart thing to do would be to build a house in space. Keep all my stuff and journals there. Or find a new planet. If I'm the only immortal in all of existance then aliens might find me fascinating.  "You'll slowly forget things over time." Journals are a thing. Plus again, I'm going to (and already have) do that anyways. "You'll still be there in the dark forever and ever." For all we know death is the exact same thing. And eventually my mind would crack and I would go into a coma like state. Just lost in my memories of what used to be.   I'd still want to be immortal.

If immortality is possible all I have to do is replicate it, and if it is possible then it's likely happened before. Am I truly the only immortal being in all of existance? "You'll float in space forever." Sure, I might. The more likelihood is eventually I'd find my way to another planet. Even if painfully slow. The smart thing to do would be to build a house in space. Keep all my stuff and journals there. Or find a new planet. If I'm the only immortal in all of existance then aliens might find me fascinating.  "You'll slowly forget things over time." Journals are a thing. Plus again, I'm going to (and already have) do that anyways. "You'll still be there in the dark forever and ever." For all we know death is the exact same thing. And eventually my mind would crack and I would go into a coma like state. Just lost in my memories of what used to be.   I'd still want to be immortal.  
i never understood why someone would try and paint immortality as something negative. id take it in a heartbeat no questions asked. i believe people(rightfully) are just afraid of eternal nothingness and want to try and make it sound like its better than eternal life.

journals would be impractical, and technology is fragile over time. you would still be conscious, at least partially, because you cannot shut down. replication is only a possibility. this whole idea will always be a contentious theory, at least until proven or disproven

Maybe you wouldnt need journals.  If you found the theory of everything, then you'd just need those first principals, which would be obvious to immortal you. With that much knowledge available, you'd be uber Macgyver.  
The Problem with Immortality
Didn't think I'd feel this uneasy on a Friday afternoon but here we are  
The Problem with Immortality
I've considered all of this before. And that is why if I were offered immortality I would turn that shit down.  
The Problem with Immortality
I would still go for it. If I don't fly myself into a black hole first, eventually cosmic inflation will rip my atoms apart and I'll be scattered uniformly across the universe. NOTHING is forever.

There's been a lot of discussion around whether this post is real or not and people wanting us mods to take action. However, we are a subreddit of leisure and don't go around verifying every post that may or may not have merit.   A Grain of Salt We as mods don't usually require verification for post. If the OP would like to reach out and verify their story with us (or edit the post with verification) then they are free to. Other than that, we cannot say if a story is true or false.

As an actual Deaf person, you're lying through your teeth. This post is disgusting.  Deaf people struggle to get accessibility - yet this person is from a third world country & speaks perfect English? Not only that, but articulates it in such a poetic beautiful way? A deaf person with NO sound, limited resources, and so on knows perfect English? Deaf ppl in AMERICA struggle with English - due to lack of accessibility in the classroom/at home. I've had hearing aids my whole life. My hearing aids got lost once, and I was without them for a few months (last year). When I got hearing aids again, it was extremely overwhelming and hard to adjust back to being able to hear clearly again. Sensory overload. Yet this person, who "never heard a single thing in their life," can pop on a hearing aid & is totally cool? You can't lose your fucking hearing on a jet plane ride. This person explains it well. You need residual hearing in order to benefit from a hearing aid. You need an audiologist to adjust your hearing aids in a way that benefits you and your level of hearing. You cannot just pop on a random free hearing aid and be able to magically hear all of a sudden. "I wish I could talk to you guys via voice chat to hear everyone although I'm sure I wouldn't be able to make out what you're saying." A deaf person who has never heard sound would not be able to speak. I have some hearing, and I had to go to speech therapy for years to learn how to speak clearly. Even with speech therapy I still struggle with certain sounds/words. Someone with NO hearing would more likely benefit from a cochlear implant - which requires surgery & extensive therapy/speech therapy to adjust to. Another comment that explains this well.  ​ This post is incredibly false & it's disgusting someone would fabricate such a lie for internet clout. Edit: I’m sorry to those who were manipulated into spending your actual money on this false post.  Also, I wanted to add that being Deaf is my reality, this is fiction.

Thank you for chiming in. I reported this post yesterday for being bullshit but was worried about calling OP out publicly. I'm glad to see the mods responded and people refuted this ridiculous bullshit. I wish there was some way Reddit could refund all the guildings this post got.

My mom has hearing aids and still has an incredibly hard time hearing. She has expressed to me how lonely her world is without being able to hear. When I read this post I was saddened by how clearly fake it was. What is the point in pretending to be deaf?!  I am wanting to learn sign language because at 31 I’m already losing my hearing, just like my mom did. Thank you for taking the time to shed light on all OPs bullshit.

My son is profoundly deaf and uses cochlear implants to hear. He had hearing aids for a few months and it was a very detailed and uniquely programmed experience. It's a science and an art form, and the OP is throwing SO much misinformation out into the world on a subject that already doesn't get enough attention.  
I just heard music for the first time in my life. Which songs should I listen to?
I’m more interested in you telling us what you find by yourself exploring YouTube , maybe trying different genres of music and how they impact you.    If I could make a suggestion it would be to keep your listening broad .

For now, I'm overwhelmed with emotions. Every time I played a clip on YouTube, it's like I tasted a new juice or a dish I had never eaten before. Most of them didn't give me any feeling except the confused feeling but whenever I listened to Michael Jackson songs, I got goosebumps (and sometimes I get scared) and I felt like my eyes could see more clearly. I will definitely keep you guys updated.

Devil and God is one of my all-time favorite albums. I legitimately avoid listening to it most of the time because it's so emotionally intense. The story behind Limousine makes me tear up every time.  
Listen to Jesus Christ by brand new  
Dude. It had been years since ive heard that song. It was a big part of a really rough time in my life where I almost didn't make it and when I read your comment I went back and played it again and all these memories come flooding back.  It's amazing how much we can tie memories to a song, good or bad. Also I don't think I ever took the time to actually read the lyrics, probably heard the song 500 plus times in my life yet never read them and fuck man......that song  
Listen to Jesus Christ by brand new  
Brand new and Michael Jackson.. common theme, bit of a grey area  
Listen to Jesus Christ by brand new  
I’m so happy to see Brand New so high up on this post. Their whole discography is amazing, but may be a little overwhelming at first. Jesus Christ is the perfect starting point.

Damn dude, this made me tear up for you. I am so happy for you honestly, music is a beautiful thing.  Honestly dude, just take it slow and take in the world around you as sounds can really change your perspective of the world. Don't rush into it, as this new sensation of hearing can overwhelm you.  But dude, i am happy for you. :)

Thank you. All I know is the song sounded really pleasant and it calmed me down. It was overwhelming at first and I didn't know how to process it but it eventually started giving me emotions I never knew existed. I am not sure how to describe it.  A local pub near us has a piano and I pressed the keys. Every key evoked a new emotion. Didn't know I had been missing out this much.

Give it some time for your mind to adjust to this new sensation after all you are experiencing a new side of the world.  Soon you will be discovering a new side of yourself.

I hate to break it to you, but OP is lying. This is an elaborate lie.  I work in audiology research, and this isn't how hearing works. At all. For one thing, there's no hearing disorder which results in total hearing loss, which can be caused by a "jet plane ride", and which can be cured by a hearing aid. Hearing aids don't magically grant hearing to people who are profoundly deaf - they boost residual hearing. Seriously, I can't believe nobody has bothered to look this up. Hearing aids don't work unless you have some degree of residual hearing. Nothing about this story makes the tiniest bit of sense, but you don't have to believe me, just look up how hearing aids work. It's pretty gross that this person has written such a flowing, beautiful post, received loads of awards and compliments, and is lying through their teeth. /u/lazylizardleech, wanna explain yourself? Edit - I have to add this last little detail, it's just too funny. OP is a brand-new account, and they've only posted in three subreddits. This one, /r/changemyview, and... /r/PsychologicalTricks.

I can't believe anyone believed it. A "jet plane ride" at a few months old doesn't send anyone deaf. A "jet plane" is what literally nearly all commercial airliners are, for example, and nobody's going deaf on them. I didn't make it past this line before I started looking for the comments saying it's fake.  I can't believe how gullible people are. This is how people get scammed.

It’d help if you could put an edit on your original comment about this.  Your original comment is one of the top comments and an edit there will give more visibility to the the fact that OP doesn’t seem to be genuine.

Edit: so OP is full of shit and the story is a total fabrication. He didn’t  PM me but I appreciate everyone following up to let me know the story is false.

I just heard music for the first time in my life. Which songs should I listen to?
Wow, this is crazy. Me, as a music addict, cannot even imagine how life without sound must have been. I spend most of my time listening music. Music is the perfect way to create a certain emotion, this emotional experience you can get just by listening to a song is addicting for me. If you feel sad you can play your favorite sunny, feel-good music and that will fix a lot. When studying for a long time, listening to harder music is the perfect study-break. I am not here to suggest certain songs. Install the app Spotify, available on PC and all mobile devices. Browse around the 'search' tab and try listening to some different genres. There will be genres you like more than others, the once you like are the most important. Shuffle around some playlist, discover artist with nice voices, like Michael Jackson, and listen to some more of his songs.  To add emotional experience to certain types of music try watching more movies. You get to know what sad music of happy music sounds like. Now go listen to music, to the cars, birds and airplanes outside. Don't spend your time on Reddit. Explore the world of vibrations

 If you feel sad you can play your favorite sunny, feel-good music and that will fix a lot.   I just played "Sunny" by Boney M after reading this. It felt like I was young again and felt like my parents were around me as I heard it. I felt happy as it continued to play. They told me different songs gave different emotions. How does this even work? This totally feels like I'm drunk but it feels better without being disoriented.

"They told me different songs gave different emotions" Oh my that's a lovely question! Music is organised in notes. A note is one frequency (air wiggles so to speak) . In Europe and America we decided to name 12 of these notes, the 7 most common of these are named A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Then, after that we have the same notes but brighter. A woman's voice is brighter than a man's voice, more squeaky, if you like.  Now what is lovely with notes is that they can sound lovely one by one, like if you sing. Or, they can be used together, now we have entered a territory called "Harmony".  When I talked about notes being one frequency, I sort of lied. It is one frequency that is loud and some others which are not so loud, these are organised in a pattern called the overtone series. If notes are together and following this pattern it sounds happy, and if they are not they sound sad, sour or spicy.  I would highly recommend searching up the YouTube channel "Michael New" because it is hard explaining all of these things without sound.  The song "Sir Duke" by Stevie Wonder is a really good example of harmony. There is a video with the channel Vox about that song, with a phenomenal artist named Jacob Collier that I also would recommend watching.

Can you look up Claire de lune be Debussy? It’s the most moving piece I’ve ever heard. So simplistic and beautiful.

Not directly music itself, but go ahead and watch the original Star Wars Trilogy/Lord of the Rings trilogy. In my humble opinion they have the best soundtracks of movie history, so watching them with sound will be an experience that will most definitely stick to you. edit: Also subscribe to r/perfectlycutscreams , you deserve those laughs

Ooooh this is a great idea! I came here to pitch classical music (specifically, Holst's "Planets" suite, especially Juipiter, and Mozart's Requiem for a choir if OP wants to cry a bunch) but I hadn't even considered soundtracks!  Have you seen/heard "Stardust"? The soundtrack to that one gives me all kinds of feels, though I don't think it's as critically acclaimed as LOTR or Star Wars.

OP mentions getting goosebumps from listening to Michael Jackson. This is called “frisson” (goosebumps from music). The Lord of the Rings soundtrack does an AMAZING job of causing this feeing. Not everybody actually experiences it, too, which is interesting.

Michael Jackson's album Thriller is one of the biggest selling albums of all time, so if you like his voice try anything from that album.

I just checked out "Thriller" on YouTube. I didn't watch the MTV and I just watched the lyric video. I felt like I could "see" things, like, the walls were vibrating. And although I knew it was supposed to be a scary song, I felt goosebumps all over me. It's like I could "see" better. It's like I was blind before and like now I can see everything, like I could see 360. My brother told me to check out Billie Jean and I totally froze as soon as I heard it. I didn't know people were full of emotions like this. I've been drunk before and hearing the songs feels even more emotional than being drunk.

Wow. This sounds so different from other songs. My ears tickled. I feel giddy. Is this supposed to be like funny? I knew the lyrics but is the sound of it supposed to make one feel giddy?

If you like that I'd check out some disco.  The Bee Gees come to mind initially. edit: in that vein, you should probably listen to Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley and get it over with.  It's a good song and getting Rick Rolled a ton kinda kills it.

MJ did some crazy things with harmony in pop. Key changes that shouldn't work but do. It's not something you hear a lot, especially in Rock with You, definitely at least a little giddying hahah It's a lot to take in, but super super wonderful.

I have checked out Yesterday as suggested by others as well. While I was listening to other songs, I felt overwhelmed but when I heard Yesterday, it's like I couldn't hear it. I could hear it but it's like I could sleep while it's playing while I wouldn't be able to sleep while the other songs I checked out played. This song makes me feel cool - not cold - but cool. Sometimes it made me feel warm. It's like cool and warm alternating. Am I crazy or is this how people feel when they hear songs?

You're not crazy :) every one reacts differently to music and it's also a matter of taste. Besides that, this is very new to you so I'm not surprised that you experience strong and physical sensations. Just enjoy! You will find out what you like soon enough.

I didn't know my dogs made sounds that tingled my ears (it doesn't really hurt. It just feels like someone is rubbing my head or ears) haha. Now I can locate where my dogs are. I feel like I have super powers. Haha. It feels so good, like I am able to see 360 degrees.

I just listened to Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley! My breathing got slow but heavy and my eyes welled up with tears although this didn't happen with Billie Jean, and I felt like hugging somebody as I heard this. This is amazing! I can't believe I am feeling this. I have no idea what he's saying but I feel somewhat sad listening to this but it also feels comforting. It's like I'm being possessed by something - something that is kind and brother-like - not evil stuff.

I second Aphex Twin! Xtal, Alberto Balsalm, if you have time maybe listen to Selected Ambient Works 85-92. It's incredible how instrumental electronic/ambient music can carry and express as much (if not more) passion and emotion than some music with singing/lyrics.  
Aphex Twin - Xtal  
And then after Xtal, listen to Avril 14th.

I am sorry, but this is very fake. ​  Lost his hearing because his parents took him on at jet airplane? You do not lose your hearing on at jet airplane. If you stand too close to at jet starting up, you could damage your hearing, but not onboard a commercial airplane. They would probably afford hearing aid as well, if they take jet flights. If you are deaf from a young age your brain has not learned to process sounds. He would probably be overwhelmed by all the noises, he would not enjoy a song. If he got a normal hearing aid, that means he was far from deaf as hearing aids just amplifies sound. A cochlear implant is a whole different matter all together, and could not be gifted easily. Cochlear implants also gives different sounds and a song would sound very different.  ​ So for him to "hear for the first time" and also enjoying what he hears is just impossible. This is bullshit.

This is not to everyone's taste but I have a huge weak spot for the bass line in early era (and newer) hip hop/rap: Snoop Dogg - Gz and hustlas A$AP Rocky - Praise the Lord The Notorious B.I.G - Hypnotize Warren G - Regulate Tha Dogg Pound - Respect

Here are my top 4 artists, and some of my favourite albums of theirs.  Rumours by Fleetwood Mac 1 by The Beatles Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd Greatest Hits by Queen I’m really glad that you got your hearing aid, and that this has opened up a whole new auditory world of music for you! I hope you have fun discovering some amazing stuff! :)

You're the first comment I've seen suggesting Fleetwood Mac, good suggestion. I'd especially recommend The Chain just for the greatest bass solo of all time.

You've got lots of classic rock recommendations here! It's amazing, but there's a world of music outside it, too. I'd recommend:  Heroes - David Bowie Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley Feeling Good - Muse Shake it Out - Florence and the Machine She has the most amazing voice and this whole concert is amazing. Hell to the Liars - London Grammar Another amazing voice.

Most people are mentioning modern music so here’s some CLASSICAL MUSIC Symphonies 5 and 8(Beethoven), Fur Elise, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Turkish March, Symphony 40(Mozart), Lacrimosa(Mozart), Vivaldi 4 Seasons, Tocatta and Fugue, Nutcracker, William Tell Overture, Barber of Seville, 1812 Overture... I’m sure this is enough to get started if you are interested in hearing older music. Edit: Thanks for the add ons, I haven’t listened to classical music in a while, so mine were just off the top of my head.

I don't know why. When I heard it, I couldn't help but think of the childhood memories and I feel sad and sleepy, like I have done lots of work for the day. Sometimes I felt taken aback and sometimes I found myself sad and smiling as well as I listened to it. It's really weird.

That’s where good music likes to take you. The songs are written and performed that way for maximum emotional response.

There are so many good suggestions here, and you can't go wrong listening to the obvious classics like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie... those are easy to discover on your own. 80s synthpop might be interesting since it has a very rich aural landscape, unlike some genres of music which are awesome but more about the story being told. Ultravox "Vienna" could be cool. I'm a huge fan of Journey - there's narrative, there's skilled vocals & instrumentals, and they're catchy AF. "Wheel in the Sky" is a favourite of mine, "Don't Stop Believin'" is another, even though it's overused in TV/films.  This might sound super weird, because Dolly Parton's not exactly contemporary and has a somewhat silly reputation for certain physical attributes, but she has one hell of a voice and Jolene has beautiful but simple guitar backing up her emotional vocals. I like this particular recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixrje2rXLMA.  This is another unconventional suggestion: Al di Meola has this great song my mom & I used to listen to when I was a child on her record player. It's a masterpiece of guitar work, and it's got an incredible pace with many different styles being woven together. It borrows from Arabic and Ancient Egyptian musical styles, apparently, but is also influenced by Latin jazz. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjJ8rAaYcN0 I hope you enjoy :) What a wonderful gift that person gave you.

Love these lists of classic rock and other great stuff. Only other thing I'd add is if you're ever in a city with a great symphony, go to a concert.  You can certainly stream lots of classical music online, but being in the concert hall is really awesome. Explore tons of genres.  We're giving you a solid anglophone list here but your home country may have other styles of music we don't even know about.

I second both of these!! All Star is a classic, fun to sing along to. Mr Blue Sky is one of the happiest jams of all time. Definitely in my top 5 songs of all time.

Huge music fanatic here.  King Harvest - Dancing in the Moonlight Miles Davis - Nature Boy Bing Crosby - Stardust (1939) Astrud Gilberto - Beach Samba Astrud Gilberto - Berimbau Astrud Gilberto - The Shadow of Your Smile    Some easy listening music at the top of my head. I just feel it'll be the best genre, as it's no too in your face. It's some of the most heavenly stuff I've ever heard.  A lot of Astrud Gilberto. Sorry, I just really love Astrud Gilberto.   Edit; Two great indie songs I've been listening to.  King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - The River Mild High Club - Skiptracing

This is incredible, I could never imagine being introduced to a sensation like sound later on in life. I saw in one of your post you mentioned not understanding words. I'll leave a few suggestions of songs with no lyrics for you :) Greensleeves (Instumental) - Jeff Beck Group Maggot Brain - Funkadelic Somalia - Al Di Meola I also would recommend any music fro  the Legend of Zelda series! It may sound lame because of it being video game music, but each song truly takes you through an emotional adventure. Blues music is also very powerful and soulful.  I've been stuck on an artist named Tab Benoit for a long time. You can hear the passion in blues singers' voices when they sing. I hope you love this journey! And congratulations

I suggest going to http://everynoise.com/ and just sampling every genre imaginable. If you find a genre that screams out to you, then let everyone suggest artists in that genre! My suggestion would be Aerials by System of a Down, because it brought me and my friends together! I'd also be interested in hearing what you thought of the songs recommended, I'm going to compile them into a playlist for sure!

Congrats! I'm so happy for you! I notice that a lot of people are recommending more lyrical pieces (ie songs), which is great! I'll recommend more instrumental pieces as I think they are also valuable to listen to: The Swan - Camille Saint-Saens Pas de deux - Tchaikovsky La Forza del Destino - Giuseppe Verdi There's a ton of music subreddits on here that you can subscribe to for more recommendations!

I know that albums are sort of out of style, but try to find a concept album, take about 50 minutes to an hour out of your day, and listen to one. Focus on nothing else. Consider it meditation. It did so many wonders for my spirit. ​ Here are some I really recommend: Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd The Wall - Pink Floyd 2112 - Rush I, Robot - Alan Parsons Project Close To the Edge - Yes Fragile - Yes Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles Duke - Genesis Thick as a Brick - Jethro Tull ​ Of course, everyone has their favorites. Find ones that work for you. Good luck on your musical journey!

According to u/Leftover-Craic, this story is entirely fabricated, so, in honor of him (or her), I decided to figure just how much was wasted on this post.  By adding up all of the awards, they came out to a big old 68,400 Reddit Coins. Albeit, most of this was due to the 40,000 Prestigious Pineapple.  Now, not everybody has that coinage around, so I did some more math, and then assuming someone paid for all of the coins out of pocket, this would be $170.9829($171) USD. This is around 152 Euros, or close to 137 Pounds.  Now, again, not everybody did that, so I figured that you get 700 coins a month with Reddit Premium, and 1000 coins when you first get it, so, this adds up to around 8 years of constant Reddit Premium. Or 96.3 months. ~2929 days, if you wish.  Just a little fun I decided to have, but let me know if I did anything wrong! I did this all in my notes, and I used my phone calculator, so this is probably FAR from perfect, lol.

It kinda bothers me how everyone is shying away from more modern music, some of which is far more emotional than classics they’re suggesting (and normally better mastered bar compression). Kanye west-ghost town Chance the rapper-same drugs (YouTube ver) Travis Scott-90210 Frank Ocean-Nights Daft Punk-Instant Crush Mac Miller-Cinderella James Blake-Retrograde Tyler, the Creator-See you again Gesaffelstein-Viol Julia Michaels-Apple We shouldn’t have to be so scared to appreciate modern music. Yeah, classics are, well... classic, but much of it was just the popular music of the time, and there’s no reason to treat modern music any differently (Also cause I’ve not seen them mentioned  Massive attack-teardrop New Order-Elegia The Cranberries-Zombie Siouxsie & the banshees-Spellbound The Smiths-This Charming Man Joy Division-Love will tear us apart again Aphex twin-avril 14th)

I don't get it. Redditors are so fast to jump to the conclusion that a post isn't genuine. Yet when something so...incredibly, obviously false - completely impossible, in fact - gets popular, everybody believes it?  Nobody is calling this out? Come on, reddit, you're letting me down. Yes, people can regain lost hearing...but they aren't going to have any ability to enjoy modern popular music, not right away.  It'd just be noise.  People who regain their hearing after spending a life in silence don't just start listening to as much music as they can.  They often turn their aids off because it gets too noisy for them.  They can't process music like you or I.  Also, OP wouldn't have the ability to distinguish a singer's voice from other sounds in the song - if you don't know what a guitar sounds like, how do you know it's not a voice?  It seems silly, but if you can't hear, you wouldn't know.  There's just so much...wrong...here.  But everybody wants to jump on board this fantasy train.  Well, enjoy the ride.  I'm not usually one to call out a post, but this one is egregiously bad and nobody else seems to be speaking up.  
Hell, even deaf people from English speaking countries usually have a few quirks and mistakes in writing in English (sign languages have a completely different grammar system compared to English). But sure this guy had grew up and learned his countries sign language, learned how to write in his countries language and then learned to write in perfect English in a country with likely little resources for the deaf.  
No you're right, I'm deaf myself. Since there are many deaf folks that grew up with ASL, that's a huge reason why their grammar is different than English grammar. (English words but different grammar). On the other hand, deaf ppl who were forced to learn to speak might've not gotten full access to English due to accessibility issues.  And you're right, it's hard enough getting resources in a first world country... I know many deaf people that come from poor countries and they really struggled with learning English.  This post is total bullshit.

I dug through the comments trying to find a comment like yours. I don’t buy OP’s story at all. A person in a third world country  who needs a hearing aid to be able to hear at all but doesn’t have the resources to get one, somehow had the resources to learn perfect English while deaf.  Add to that how he claims to be able to appreciate music straight away after being deaf almost his entire life ... Total bullshit.

 “Thank you. All I know is the song sounded really pleasant and it calmed me down. It was overwhelming at first and I didn't know how to process it but it eventually started giving me emotions I never knew existed. I am not sure how to describe it.  A local pub near us has a piano and I pressed the keys. Every key evoked a new emotion. Didn't know I had been missing out this much.” This just doesn’t sound like a third world country to me.

I completely agree with you. I am deaf with a cochlear implant and I absolutely love music. I never learnt how to sign and I had to rely on my hearing aids and lip reading to communicate.  I always loved music but I could only understand really basic pop songs as a kid like Robbie Williams, backstreet boys and the like. Only after countless repeats could I then understand the music, understand the beats and reading the lyrics while listening to the song I could actually figure out what the words were. Even then I couldn’t actually get the timing right of the words I used to record music videos and watch them all the time!! Loudly!! And this is with a hearing aid. When I got my cochlear implant at 11 years old I expected to be able to hear the music so much better but I was shocked to find that I couldn’t even recognise my favourite songs! Backstreets back sounded so foreign to me and I had to relearn what sound was all over again. I’ve always been into music and rhythm. Surrounded by guitars and pianos growing up, I learnt to play the drums because as a deaf kid I could understand rhythm but not melody. Wth the cochlear implant I was able to eventually understand melody and tones and hear lyrics better but that was after years of listening to music and training my brain how to recognise sounds! So when OP talks about the feelings associated with the sounds in my experience I find it hard to believe, to me the first sounds I hear were like white noise, it was after repeating the sounds and learning how to pinpoint the sounds to learn what it sounds like that I’m now able to appreciate and love music. As a deaf person I listen to a lot of music with great beats and Melody’s, I love the Australian indie/electronic sound like ocean alley, flume, Chet faker, parcels, Peking duk. I also love rap music but often find it hard to understand the raps, but if I have the lyrics with me I can sometimes follow along well like Eminem and childish gambino or Kanye west. I work in bars and restaurants, I’m just about to open my own bar as well. I feel like I’ve trained my brain well enough to be able to process different sounds, home in on conversations that I’m having, plus lip reading skills help as well, and if I know the song well I can pick it out over background noise. But I’ve had my implant for 21 years and I’ve never turned it off when it gets too loud or noisy. Some people can’t deal with it I’ve had friends who have struggled with the noise and prefer to sign. There’s nothing wrong with that everyone is different. I struggle to speak on the phone but I’ve heard of other cochlear implant users who speak really well on the phone, to strangers, one being my 11 year old son who got two implants before he was 1 year old. He will answer the phone at home, no problems at all! It’s all about training the brain and what you put your mind to but it takes time. Ok I’m done! If OP is actually genuine, listen to Gold by Chet Faker 😁

Seriously, was thinking the exact same thing. The OP even makes it sound so magical and overblown. Granted, of course literally being able to hear after a lifetime not being able to would be special, but it read as a very exaggerated novelesque sugar-full take on hearing recovery.

Bohemian rhapsody. That's a world favourite. All the meme songs, so that you can understand the references we make online. Some old symphonies, to show you something old and beautiful. I suggest any of "The Planets" by Gustav Holst, or Beethoven's fifth symphony, and absolutely Pathétique. And then just whatever tickles your fancy next.

Out of all the Eminem songs I wouldn’t play rap god first lol. I would pick a more fun slower song like Without me.  Oh man, this guy probably hasn’t heard rap before, that just gives a whole new world of choices. September is Earth Wind and Fire btw, great song.

Somewhere over the rainbow by Israel Kamakawiwo would be high on my list of songs to listen too.    That's an amazing gift, few gifts are as amazing as the gift of a primary sense like hearing!  
I just heard music for the first time in my life. Which songs should I listen to?
That’s so interesting! I love music, and as a musician, I can’t imagine my life without it. Here are a few songs I like that you might enjoy listening to. “The Arizona Sword” by Leslie Fish  “Je Vivroie Liement” by Guillame de Machaut “Pais Dinogad” by Ffynnone and Lynne Denman “Cad é sin don té sin” by Caladh Nua “Requiem” by Mozart “Danse Macabre” by Camille Saint-Saëns “Barrett’s Privateers” by Stan Rogers “Scarborough Fair Canticle” by Simon and Garfunkel  “The Horsetamer’s Daughter” by Julia Ecklar and Leslie Fish  “Ganondorf” by Toru Minegishi, Asuka Ota, and Koji Kondo “I Riden Så” by Gjallarhorn “Flowers of the Forest” by Dark Isle Bagpiper “The Longing” by Patty Gurdy “Wolf Totem” by The HU “Urtiin Duu” by unknown Three songs by a Bulgarian choir Qiyan music of Al Andalus   I apologise if that’s too much, but those are all songs I find important and/or beautiful. If I were in your shoes, I’d try to take a day or two off to dedicate to exploring the sounds of music. I’m so happy you get to experience this beautiful art form now!

All these gullible idiots in here giving this liar money & offering tons of shit out of the kindness of their hearts getting played like a fiddle.  Honestly I don't feel sorry for anyone who wasted money or time on this clown because you're just as bad for not realizing right away that this is 100% bullshit.

Me being a designated driver is the reason I met my husband. And also reduced the risk of any innocent deaths. Seriously don't drink and drive

As a huge drinker, I just want to commend you for being so selfless. Having someone that hung out with me and drove me around when I was drunk would be amazing. Now if I’m stuck somewhere where I’m drinking, I have to drink water and give myself a few hours or just end up staying there. I hate it.

I don't in my small town and as a heavy drinker its led me to simply drinking alone in my home instead of at bars unless I wanna do exactly as this guy mentioned.

You need more than "a few hours" if you're getting drunk. It can take up to 12 hours to sober up. If you're just having a few, a few hours is fine, but if you're getting sloshed (as your post implies) stay off the roads.

Drinking water and waiting a few hours is still probably not a good idea. You should always have a plan.

A few hours isn't enough to sober up. Sometimes even a whole night isn't. Be careful with that

Yeah I had seen him before and we had mutal friends but we'd never spoken much, we were at a house party and I was the DD for my friend group. He got very Ill, not from drinking too much but some winter vomiting bug, and needed a lift back home, my name was suggested and the rest is history!

I tell my bf no matter where he is or how drunk he is, call me ASAP. Idc how miserable I am if I have to go too, Dont. Drive. Drunk. When I was in the 5th grade, one of the kindergarteners I was assigned to read to got killed by a drunk driver in broad daylight. In his yard. While the teacher was over for parent teacher conference.

He was someone I'd seen but never really knew, we were ar the same house party and I wasn't drinking so j could drive my friends home. he got sick because of some winter vomiting bug was asking for a lift home and a mutual friend I was going to drive home suggested my name.

A few years back I had an Uber driver that only drove for new years eve. She said that herself and her husband both did it that night. They were from a small town around 2 hours away, but came to my city, which was the closest "big" city to them. Their son or daughter, I forget, was killed by a drunk driver 2 years previous on NYE.l in my city. She actually offered to give me my fare back in cash  as they only wanted to do their best to make sure no one else went through what they did. I declined that offer and told her to keep it or donate it elsewhere.

r/StLouis has a post with a $25 Lyft promo credit valid tonight from 4pm to 2am.  Check your local city's sub to see if they have the same.  Share it with friends, especially anyone that may be a minor and too scared to call a parent for a ride after drinking.

I've always wanted to try doing this, but I live in a place without Uber/Lyft. Out of curiosity, is NYE the only time he does this?

No. He does it part time. Generally Friday and Saturday nights. Partially for the same reason as nye and partially because he can make a few hundred dollars in a weekend for a few hours of work

Lost my little brother almost 4 years ago to drunk driving. He was the sober passenger and the only casualty. Helping my mother sort through his things as well organize his cremation and wakes was SO painful.  Please remember the other family when you get behind the wheel drunk tonight. It’s not worth it on SO many levels...just call a DD or Uber.

Yep. My uncle's body was found last week, the day before Christmas Eve. He had died of a stroke in his apartment 4 or 5 days before. It wasn't pretty. I got to spend Christmas Eve cleaning out his putrid smelling apartment of important papers while avoiding the juices of his decomposition on the couch. Then Christmas was spent helping to plan his funeral. Not a good time. Don't cause it unnecessarily for someone else.

Do just everything you folks want to do to have fun!! Parenting dogs is like an invisible leash FOR the dog parents. They’re worth it, but doggie day care(full day) and in facility boarding for two dogs costs like $85/day. The cost of boarding is just slightly lower than a mid range hotel for humans.  From one dog mom to other dog parents, take pains to never get grandma mad at you guys!  Think about the doggie parents who are hiding under the bed comforting their noise phobic dogs and make a toast to all of the great people who happily stay home to help them deal with the fireworks. Our vet prescribes Ace Promazine for our lil dude.   It’s a calming med.   Bring your mom a lovely gift to thank her for dog sitting!

Trust me I am so beyond appreciative that my mom is willing to do this! She will often text me at working asking me to bring my doggo over so she can have a few hours with her. Luckily I do have several other options since my little girls best friend is owned by my best friend so we dog sit for each other every couple days so they can have sleepovers together. Bonus point is that they live 2 apartments down from me.  If SO and I want to go out but don’t have a sitter we will just stay at my place instead of his.

My girlfriend was killed almost a year ago because some asshole decided to get behind the wheel drunk. She was on her way home from work. We work together. When she wasn’t home, I went to her last location on Find My Friends on IPhone and found her car torn to pieces and police at the scene. I was on the verge of tears when the officer wouldn’t answer my questions about her well being. I had to go home and tell her family about the accident and had to translate the doctor declaring that they couldn’t revive her. I’ll never forget the way her mother screamed.

please dont drive high either i know its probably a bit redundant to most people here (sober and all), but its scary how many people think that driving high isnt driving impaired because they arent drunk. not to mention all the morons that think theyre somehow a better driver while high.  it doesnt matter if you made it home safely 100 out of 100 times. you owe it to everyone else to be sober, or stay off the damn road

This is why me and my wife stay at the house during New Years and 4th of July. A night of drinking and fireworks in the town isn’t worth potentially getting killed by some idiot who thinks there sober enough to drive. We would rather drink and eat ribs by a bonfire at our own home instead.

My friends and I never learnt our lesson in a bad way from drinking and driving. ( never killed anyone crashed a vehicle got pulled over or injured anyone) but I realized how fucking stupid we were being and I had an intervention with my friends. Now one of us will always be the designated driver when we go somewhere. We were young and dumb and luckily never got killed or killed anyone.

The “I” in DUI is a lot more than just alcohol. It’s the most common one but a lot of things can influence your driving including being too tired. If you’re not sober/feeling good don’t drive. That $50 Uber is a steal compared to the $10,000+ DUI

Can confirm.  I am only here today because some absolute saint made the decision to put rumble strips on the shoulders of interstate 45 in Texas. Never ever drive tired.  Pull over in a safe place and catch a quick nap.  Better late than dead.

Pills these days are way more popular than weed, and imo way more effective at impairing you while driving. The problem stems from also a lot of these people being young dumbass kids who feel invincible, and the fact that they like to mix their pills with things like pot or alcohol which is equivalent to adding fuel to a raging fire. It's just stupid people making even more stupid decisions and it all compounds itself. Also doesn't help that a lot of people get depressed this time of year anyways, so drugs are even more appealing to them.

Idk where you live but that's one good thing about the US, there's no way 64% of all vehicle related deaths were DUI related. I think it's more like 26% here in the US, at least strictly alcohol related. Still, 10,000 people dying from something preventable is tragic. Although if we're being totally honest our entire traffic model is a fucking mess so there were actually 40,000 preventable deaths and that's even more tragic.

yeah man, people shouldn't drive stoned either I'm guilty as fuck of that, but I ain't gonna pretend like it's a good idea it's not as bad as driving drunk, but who cares? only takes one fuckup on the road to kill someone

Yep, like you said. All it takes is one fuck up. A friend of mine was killed by a driver who was drunk/stoned. He wasn’t “totally wasted” either, but it was enough.  If your reaction time is stalled by even a fraction of a second, that’s all it takes when you’re driving a literal weapon.  What if a moose bolts out of a ditch from behind some bushes? Even sober, you could be in trouble. But if you’re tired, and/or impaired, you’re even more fucked.

That's true, but honestly, I'd argue neither does it find you nor do you find it. What happens is - if we do our own thing and we do it happily, stay open to people, are kind and don't shut ourselves off to the opportunity, chances arise - and these chances can often turn into something marvellous if people are willing to put the work in. It's less magic or fate or whatever crazy names people have for it than it is about honesty and communication anyway. Rough patches will always happen and compromises will absolutely be necessary - and as long as we're open to that and so is our partner, solutions can be found and love kept alive :)

It is absolutely this. All I meant was, do your own thing and try to generally live a good life for you, rather than pine after an undefinable concept. Spent years ‘looking for the one’, with no luck, and spent fewer years just working on myself with much luck, if you want to call it luck. Also, to note, my partner breaks every single mold I had put for myself for the imaginary ‘the one’, so i believe it simply cannot be something that is searched for as that will undoubtedly have bias and prejudice. Instead, as you said, it is just about being open to people/experiences, working on yourself, and putting work into something you think is worth it.

Damn the more you avoid your feelings the more uncomfortable you become when they start to resurface. I lost friends this way. You want your feelings validated you gotta validate them yourself.

I really wish more couples understood this.  I see guys all the time talking about the ol' lady or the old ball and chain and talking about how marriage is a prison ersumshit.   Dude, what the hell are you talking about? I will never have a cross word to say about my wife to anyone.  The only words anyone will ever hear about her from me will be praise of the highest regard.  Granted, she is a truly amazing and wonderful woman, but she's still human and she has flaws.  But I'm not gonna sit and bitch to my buddies about them.  And be prepared to catch your teeth should a foul word about her cross your lips in my presence.

That's easy when your wife is amazing. But when she isn't you sometimes need to vent to someone.  Internalizing and building anger isn't always the best thing.

There isn’t always a solution to the problem though.  My husband is awesome overall. But he has severe medical problems that makes it so he physically can’t do a lot of chores around the house. He makes up for it in other ways, but occasionally I’m just fried from doing all the physical labor in my house plus my job plus whatever else is going on. It’s not his fault, talking to him would achieve nothing but making him feel bad about something outside his control, and sometimes I want to complain about how unfair life is. Now I’ll only vent to very few people about this and they normally only hear good things about him, but yes, I will occasionally vent to a friend of mine who also knows what it’s like to be in a relationship with someone with disabilities. Hell, sometimes he even gives me advice on stuff that can help.

This is true, but sometimes discretely talking to a trusted friend to get perspective before addressing particular issues with a partner can be helpful and healthy.  I’m not suggesting airing all the dirty laundry, but there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer for relationships.

I had a bunch of work friends over for a party like 4 years ago. When my wife mingles with them, they all talked about how positively I talk about her at work. She still brings that up from time to time, and is happy every time. If you want to win major points with your wife, have a third party tell her about how you talk her up when she's not around. She also was kicked out of a carpool because the other 3 women only wanted to bitch about their husbands, and she almost never had anything bad to say about me.

I view marriage as my worst nightmare; an absolute living hell on Earth. That's why I'm not married. If you think there's even a slight chance of marriage feeling like a prison to you, why the fuck did you get married‽ Bitching about your marriage is like shutting yourself inside a refrigerator, and then bitching that there's not enough room.

I agree 98% with this.  But my very best friend will hear all my uncensored thoughts, just because yeah, no person or relationship is perfect, and it's good for my mental health to have one person outside the relationship I can vent to/bounce ideas off of. Especially since my best friend is damn good at pointing out other perspectives to me and telling me when I'm just plain wrong or full of shit. A therapist would also be a valid outside-the-relationship person to be uncensored with.

Especially since my best friend is damn good at pointing out other perspectives to me and telling me when I'm just plain wrong or full of shit. A therapist would also be a valid outside-the-relationship person to be uncensored with.  
This is the sane, balanced response. Talk badly of your partner is not the way to go but you need to have someone to talk about it too. Just be sure it's someone that will either listen and not "suggest" or someone that will know you will enough to tell you "you are in the wrong there, buddy".  
I really wish more couples understood this.  I see guys all the time talking about the ol' lady or the old ball and chain and talking about how marriage is a prison ersumshit.   Dude, what the hell are you talking about? I will never have a cross word to say about my wife to anyone.  The only words anyone will ever hear about her from me will be praise of the highest regard.  Granted, she is a truly amazing and wonderful woman, but she's still human and she has flaws.  But I'm not gonna sit and bitch to my buddies about them.  And be prepared to catch your teeth should a foul word about her cross your lips in my presence.  
Yeah it’s honestly so weird to me how normalized it is to despise your spouse

This is sooo true, especially if you and your spouse are deep friends too. And that's why this works for best friends too.  I have been learning to do some art and design and I was nervous to let my friends know. Sure they were sarcastic at first but believe me I was having so many mixed emotions and covered my face when the same friend was yelling at the other guy who was bitching about how bad my project was.  Makes you wonder if friends can be that good and supportive what an entity a spouse can be.

There’s no one I trust less than someone who bad mouths their spouse to a group of friends.

I think that’s boomer shit. Maybe it has penetrated millennials outside of my sphere, but I have heard nothing but nice things said about spouses from the people around me. I always thought, if people dislike their family so much why do they stay around them?  
I found out my husband brags about me to his friends
I brag about my wife too. She's awesome, I let her know she's awesome....every single day. Not one day goes by where I don't tell her how sexy she is either. It's been 16 years and every year gets better. Every day I love her more than the last. Whatever you're doing, you're doing it right.  People who talk poorly about their partners are obviously unhappy and should do something about it. Like talking to their partner about what they're feeling for starters.

Every once in a while, my sister will go on a tear, bragging to me about her husband. What makes it extra nice is that sometimes I do outdoor things with him and he brags about her to me, too. Coming from an unstable, dysfunctional family (I seriously don’t know how many husbands our mother had—long story), so it’s hard to describe my relief and joy, knowing that she has a happy marriage. I bet your family feels the same.

Isn't it awesome.  I freaking love being in love with my best friend and biggest cheerleader.  I'll meet people at my husband's work Christmas parties who will be like, "Oh you're Red!" And expect me to be some freaking mythical being because my husband talks so sweet about me.

This is very cool. Good on you. On you both, in fact. It makes me wonder how we got to the point today that a dismayingly large number of people (mostly men, but not entirely I guess) disparage behavior like your husband’s. Simping is the term I think. I see a lot of it here on Reddit and so that raises all kinds of questions, too.  There’s so much fear and ignorance and anger, even rage, where does it come from?  My god, I’m becoming a “Why can’t we all just get along” guy meme. Never mind, I’m happy for you both.

I was talking to someone on Reddit, and they made a great point. They said most happy, successful people don't have a big online presence, they are actually living their life. The people online, the redditors, they are trying to fill a void, they have a lot of unhappiness in their life and are trying to find a way to fill it. He's right, and it's honestly sad

What OPs husband does isn't simping. Simping is going overboard to get the slightest bit of attention from someone who doesn't have any feelings for you. Mostly see it used when people are giving money to female twitch streamers.  This is a good example : Spending thousands of dollars to buy them stuff when they barely even know you exist.

There's a very large thick enormous line between simping and what OPs husband is doing. Not even in the same ballpark.

My husband does this all the time in his WoW guild. I love this about him because all of his guildmates know me even though I don't talk to them. The girls in his guild always say pass along their hellos if he says I'm in the room. It's just a really nice way for me to be a part of his hobbies that we don't do together. He always starts talking about me by saying "My wonderful wife deejaybeta"...  
I found out my husband brags about me to his friends
It wasn't until a few years ago i realized how much my boyfriend respected me and admired me. Granted, he's learned to be more open about this, but one of my favorite things is that he brags about me when he's streaming and he uses me as like a power of knowledge authority when he fact checks people.  It's extremely flattering and it's so nice! I will admit the longer we are together, the more he loves me and shows me his love. It's really, really nice.  My friends don't get the same support or they say mean things about their spouses and i don't understand.

I used to brag about my ex-wife in the same way.  She also knew about it.  I didn’t know that she had opened like a thousand credit cards, maxed them all out, then cheated on me after I found out I have 3 completely incurable autoimmune diseases that will only get worse over time and make my life more and more painful until I die.  She and her kid she had before we were together didn’t have to pay for a single thing either.  I paid for everything.  She took all my money and somehow left me with all her debt.  I don’t get to see the kid anymore either.  I hope that little girl is ok.  I tried to open a new checking account a couple days ago and they denied me.  I’m happy to say that I was able to open a new “second chance” checking account today.  I don’t understand what I did wrong.  I thought we were in love.  I taught her kid her ABCs and how to read.  They never wanted for anything.  I was and still am romantic, or I do my very best I can.  I treated her kid as my own.  They always came first.  I’m a tall and attractive man as other people have told me.  I never cheated or even entertained the idea.  It wasn’t even on my radar as an option.  I have a very successful career and make good money.  I don’t know why I am even typing this.  I guess I am still just very hurt and confused.  Maybe my diagnosis was something she just didn’t want to deal with long term?  Maybe I am just an idiot and she was a shitty person the whole time?  It really didn’t seem that way.  I am really glad that your husband appreciates you so much that he can’t even contain his excitement for how great you are.  I bet that feels really good.  I hope I find that someday.

How amazing! Every now and then I bump into someone my hubs knows, work, socially, whatever. Every time when they find out when I'm his wife they explode with energy about he talks non stop about me. It always makes me laugh because as far as I know my hubs is only slightly familiar with my maiden name. Lol. Certainly there are many times I wanted to yeet him out of the car and then I remember the one time John Doe from that one thing one time told me that hubs wouldn't shut about me. Lol

Years ago when our kids were little we wrote Christmas letters to our close family and friends. My now ex-husband wrote "MoonRabbitWaits is keeping her finger in the x industry pie", as I had been doing a little casual work from home. When we next saw his best friend he said to me "so you are baking now?"  I thought it was so freaking funny he thought I was a baker with my finger in the pies. Bad baker!

Wonder if they keep a crow bank somewhere and go there to pay for the lunch. Also move towards cashless payments will hurt the crow-human segment of economy unless substitutes are found soon.

Reminds me of a story on reddit where this guy regularly gave a crow one of his tacos at lunch.  One day the crow brought him a coin and mimicked the word 'taco'.  It knew you needed money to buy tacos.

They’ll also communicate your face to other crows like their children. There are a lot of interesting stories about the shiny things crows give!  It’s ominous when a crow gives you a random key.

There was a story on r/nosleep a while ago where someone fed crows who gave them change and whatever. They moved and the crows followed them. Eventually the crows began bringing human teeth instead of money. Seemed made up, but was a really good read.

Corvids in general are incredibly intelligent. Some have even been trained to pick up litter on beaches in exchange for treats, and I remember reading a story about a girl that would drop crumbs on her way to school for the crows and they started bringing her ribbons and tinsel because she tended to wear clothes with ribbons.  On the flip side as well, they’ll remember who treats them badly. Plenty of stories about assholes that would throw rocks at them getting serial bird bombed constantly, even when they weren’t anywhere near the area where they abused the birds, and even watching to see what car they drove so they could get a nice thick layer all over it. Corvids are basically the bird form of “don’t start no shit.”

Our old cat ate a baby crow that fell out of the nest. For the next few weeks they dive bombed him when he went outside. Then he caught one out of the air and ate it and they decided to sit on the power line and heckle him from a distance. They did it for years until he passed.

They don't really have a concept of currency, they're just fascinated by shiny objects.  But they are leaving the coins as a sign of gratitude - they're that developed.  They'll even "sled" using lids on icy rooftops for fun.   Whatever you do don't piss them off.

Ravens are very similar. Don't be an ass to them though, as they will be an ass right back. I provoked one a few years ago, and after a few days they must've found my balcony I would smoke on. There would often be one hangin out on it just making noise, Shit all over the place.  They bugged me for a couple months, then someone said to give them something. A handful of my dogs fur after a brushing, then more and more. Now I leave some outside once in a while, no more shitty balcony

I once saw a crow struggling to crack open a nut in the middle of the street. So I walked up to it, and the crow backed off, watching me from a distance. I crushed the nut open with my foot and walked away. Standing about 20ft away, i saw the crow come back to the cracked nut and I swear it gave me a look of gratitude before beginning to eat it’s meal :)

When I was in college, I was volunteering at our children's dental clinic. We had to go into lock down because "a mysterious person was walking around with different masks on"  Turns out, it was a professor at our school doing an experiment  with crows and facial recognition. Started learning more about crows after this and they're pretty darn intelligent 👌

Crows like shiny and metallic things. Growing up a buddy of mine had a pet crow and it used to bring him screws, nuts, bolts etc. One time his dad was rebuilding a lawnmower outside and the crow kept coming down and taking bolts and nuts out of the pile he had during disassembly.

Long time ago I saw a thing about a guy in New York who built a little peanut dispenser in his window that took quarters.  He trained a crow how to use it and that crow wound up teaching others, before long he had birds dropping off quarters for a couple peanuts each, gathering change from the whole city for him.

They’ll probably come back later this spring with their kids! This is a good time of year to feed them dog food, since usually parents are feeding their fledglings.  My crows never brought me rewards, but the same family has been coming back for three years. They also will go around the neighborhood with me when I go on walks.

Do they do it sneakily in bursts from tree to tree or do they flutter behind you in full majesty as if you were a Disney princess?

Somewhere in the middle, actually! They will fly fence to fence, sometimes they use the power lines. They stay pretty close. Feels like I have an escort around they neighborhood. Surprisingly, they don’t seem to care if I have my dog with me, although they definitely care when he’s out in the yard.

I've tried to feed the crows in my neighborhood in the past, but the never seemed interested, or at least I've never seen them go for the food I toss out to them. There's an open field in the area a lot of crows hang out at, I figured that'd be a good place to go. Do you have any suggestions? I have dog food to give them, should I just drop a bowl and walk away? Edit: Also, any particular time of day that would be best?

What did you feed them? We have crows around my house now (though sometimes i see some so HUGE i wonder if there aren't any ravens though i dont think south Florida has ravens,  but I digress). I do have a pretty big German Shepherd so maybe they stay away cause  of that. I think they're  a bit spooky but also super cool and smart so I'd like to feed them.

I actually kind of always wondered about this. Like, could you teach a crow (/whatever type of bird) to fly into an open window, recognize valuable items, and have them bring it to you? Or would the "fear" instinct be too strong to override? Or is entire thought just stupid?

There are YouTube videos of crows problem solving puzzles and stuff. They’d likely have the capacity to learn something like that.

This is super possible. In some places crows have been successfully trained to pick up cigarette butts. If they can distinguish between wrappers and cigarettes then they should be able to identify quarters.

Would you consider yourself a rabbit person?  I wouldn’t consider myself one. I love my stupid little guy, but I definitely prefer my rat boys as pets. Rabbits are sweet, and I respect them, but it’s hard to consider them “pets”. Mine are/were bred at a farm, mind you, but they just don’t seem to bond with people in the way a rat does, or a cat. If my rabbits running at me, it’s probably because I just lugged home a huge box of hay, and am ripping it open ahahah.  I also find that some of my friends/relatives hate the smell of “rabbits”. I’m inclined to say it’s more of a barn smell, as the rabbit itself doesn’t smell bad, but the hay can get pretty musty.  Rabbits are such great little creatures.

They really like dog food, and it’s actually good for them in addition to being cheaper than nuts. My kid has peanut and tree nut allergies, so the crows we feed aren’t getting any either. They cool with it.

I’ve read about a little girl who fed the crows which included a picture of all her ‘presents’ I believe they are attracted to shiny things, she had a great collection and if my memory serves me well, I think they followed her to the school bus or something, like protecting her almost.  Was also added on about a photographer who lost a small lens or part of something once and it appeared where the crows which he fed left him things.  I’ve been tempted to try this out of interest but I’m scared Incase I forget to feed them or I’ve no food, that and they’ll shit on my car!

Do not under any circumstances piss off a crow. One landed on the tree right above my small car outside my old house and I shoo it away with my grocery bag, yes harshly, i mean they are big birds up close and I have seen the movie birds. There were four the next week same spot eyeballing me. When my wife would come out they would be cool and fly away, if I came out they frickin yelled at me and would not be shoo'ed till I ran into the bird shit covered Veloster and drove off.  Do not piss off crows.

There is a mini documentary about this behavior from crows. Like an episode of ' The Nature of Things' or something.  This is not uncommon behavior.  A girl in the pacific north west of USA experienced the same from a small murder. She got ' gifts' from them. Mostly shiny and colorful objects they would find. Crows are highly intelligent. You are lucky. I would love this.

As a bird lover, I find this tale of the tipping crows utterly delightful. Years ago we lived in a small town in central Wisconsin, with an old open pasture for a backyard between two woodlots. My wife is a superb cook and baker, but not every recipe you try can be a winner. She once made a big batch of large, tan cookies that were just too sweet. Rather than throw them out, I put them out at the fence-line in our back yard, where deer and other critters often fed. Within about half an our, the yard was full of crows, each picking up a cookie, cawing delightedly and flying up into the trees to enjoy their newfound treats. If I'd read your story back then, I'd have put out a tip jar!

I found out recently just how smart crows and ravens actually are. They can be taugh to talk. Ravens have been known to mimic certain sounds on their own in the wild. They solve very complex puzzles and have a social order in their ranks. Very cool birds. Oh and crows are different birds than ravens. I didn't realize that either. Go on youtube and just type in "smart raven or crow"

I married my high school bully.
I’m sure I’ve read this fanfic  
I married my high school bully.
This sounds more like an anime plot  
I married my high school bully.
 She still claims to this day that I’m the only girl she’s ever had feelings for   As a bisexual but homoromantic woman who lives a lesbian-only life, this makes me uneasy. I appreciate her being so honest but I hate the burden of being the exception. Good on you for being more comfortable in that than I would be.

Genuinely not being a turd here, your first sentence just had a lot I’m not familiar with. What does it mean to be bisexual but homoromantic and living a lesbian-only life?

not op, but i just want to pitch in my two cents to help you understand a bit. most people think that sexual attraction and romantic attraction come together as a package, but they can be two separate things, so for op, they're sexually attracted to men and women i.e. bisexual, but in terms of romantic attraction, they're only attracted to women i.e. homoromantic. not sure about the "lesbian-only life", so i'll leave that for op to explain.

I think by that she means she doesn't pursue men even sexually since it could get awkward if he catches feelings she won't and she doesn't find it worth the complications when she can just date women and be fine  
Genuinely not being a turd here, your first sentence just had a lot I’m not familiar with. What does it mean to be bisexual but homoromantic and living a lesbian-only life?  
I've fucked dudes but I don't have any emotion towards them. So, like, any gender can be sexually attractive to me (though the numbers are... very slanted towards women anyhow), but homoromantic being I only develop feelings of any significance towards other women.  
Genuinely not being a turd here, your first sentence just had a lot I’m not familiar with. What does it mean to be bisexual but homoromantic and living a lesbian-only life?  
What she means is that she’s sexually attracted to both women and men but she only has romantic feelings for women. This is fairly common. A bisexual, homoromantic woman might sleep with men and feel attracted to them but wouldn’t generally develop romantic feelings for them and want to enter into a serious relationship with them. Similarly a bisexual heteroromantic woman might have sex with other women but only really falls for guys and wouldn’t want a relationship with a woman. Her saying she lives a lesbian only life probably means that she only gets involved sexually and romantically with women.

Ohhhhhhhhhh okay. That makes sense  
Genuinely not being a turd here, your first sentence just had a lot I’m not familiar with. What does it mean to be bisexual but homoromantic and living a lesbian-only life?  
I'm assuming you're a straight guy like me, the way it was explained to me is that romantic and sexual attraction are not always a package. Like when you see a very attractive woman -  but then you overhear her berating the waitstaff at the restaurant you're in and your brain acknowledges the sexual attraction... But now you have lost that other element. And maybe you would go for her, and could potentially try to hook up with her but you don't feel any romantic feelings for her.  Maybe that's not the best metaphor but I tried.  
 She still claims to this day that I’m the only girl she’s ever had feelings for   As a bisexual but homoromantic woman who lives a lesbian-only life, this makes me uneasy. I appreciate her being so honest but I hate the burden of being the exception. Good on you for being more comfortable in that than I would be.  
Its nice to see another bisexual homoromantic woman!! Sexuality and romantic feelings are so complex, i mostly skew towards guys sexually but romantically am almost exclusively attracted to women. It makes me feel silly sometimes

Sweet story I guess but getting married and having a kid at 22/23??? To each their own but damn that's young. Obvs we don't know your circumstances, but I would love to be 22/23 again and just enjoy my life with my SO.

I'm 22 and I'd love to be married to my SO and expect a child. Instead I got stress, cheap student food and my own tears

Yeah my wife and I are in our late 20s, make close to six figures, and don’t even remotely feel like we could afford or take care of kids. I’ll never understand how people five or even ten years our junior are like “Yup we can totally afford this and are ready to have a completely different life”

Expecting a child sounds like one of them is pregnant which is extremely expensive, especially for one of them still in college and the other just graduated (based on time elapsed).

We know it’s certainly not the norm, at least in todays society, to start a family this young. However, we both know that we want a few children together and decided we’d rather have them young and enjoy our 50’s/60’s/so on together.

Good for you guys! You don’t want to be 70 with kids just going off to college, just because it’s “the norm”.

Sounds like something right out of a movie! Awesome, happy for u!  
I married my high school bully.
That's honestly so sweet, I'm glad you two have a happy ending! As a hopeless romantic bi, I always love hearing a sweet queer love story ♥️  
I married my high school bully.
There is a Swedish movie from the 90’s with that story line, you should see it, it’s great! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_Me_Love_(film)  
I married my high school bully.
This is perhaps the greatest love story I’ve ever heard. As others have said, I really hope someone in Hollywood sees this because it needs to be turned into a script pronto.  On another note, I have a strange question. When you two got married, how did the last name situation work? It’s something I’ve always wondered about same sex marriages. I’ve noticed some couples combine their last names, others keep it the way it is, and I’ve even seen one couple create a totally new last name that they both took. How did you guys go about it and if you don’t mind me asking what is the reasoning behind it?  Congrats again and best of luck with the baby girl!

She took my last name. As for the reasoning, she simply wanted to and I was honored by that.

Congrats!!! Happy for the both of you. If you graduated in 2015, then aren't u only around 23yo though?

Holy, y’all are more adults than I am... here I am still incapable of deciding what I want for breakfast. Props to you for standing up for her in a moment where something terrible could’ve happened. Really takes a certain person with courage and heart to do that for another. So happy for you two, and congrats on welcoming a child together!! So wholesome, my heart can’t handle ❤️

Idk why but as I was reading this story i was imagining it all in the animation style of sailor moon Also, cute as hell story thanks for sharing

this is the cutests fucking shit.  I would watch the fuck outta this if it was a netflix special. (also this might just be my fellow saphic bias but when i read “i an marrying my high school bully” my brain went “they are gonna be girls arent they.”) congrats on ur disney love story .

Bro this some movie shit right here YO NETFLIX COME GET YOUR SCRIPT  
I married my high school bully.
 I graduated in 2015  Shit, so did I. That would make you 22 or 23 years old, right? And already married and expecting a kid... And meanwhile, I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my life. Damn, I feel old...  
I married my high school bully.
I don't care, if there are people in this comment section who argue about this story being fake or not. These things truly can happen any day at any given time somewhere, so y'all should just pull those sticks outta your butts, because again, I don't care. I personally think that this is a very lovely and cute story regardless. There is enough negativity already in this world 24/7, no need to add to this just because you can. Learn to show empathy for once, it's not that hard. Otherwise just ignore it and move on with your lives. Makes it all the more comfortable for everyone else.

We used a process called reciprocal IVF. My eggs were fertilized by a donors sperm and the embryo was inserted into my wife’s uterus. My bun, her oven.

 My eggs were fertilized by a donors sperm and the embryo was inserted into my wife’s uterus.  Woah, that's neat.  Never heard of that before.  I like how it's made to involve both of you in the process (plus the donor) I think that's really good.  Did you get to choose the donor or did you just spin the wheel?

You definitely can’t. It’s a site wide Reddit rule. I suppose it’s to keep a post from getting onto the front page where everyone will see it, and then changing it for marketing purposes, or some other malicious action.

Your title made me think of an amusing (now) and mortifying (then) story from my early adolescence. I might as well share it here.     I was home alone one day and had just gotten done using the bathroom, wiped my rear, then knelt down to fill up a bath (our tub was broken and it took lots of fiddling to get it to stop up properly). My dad's dog zoomed into the bathroom and decided to, uh, clean my unintentionally yet perfectly presented rear. I swear, the moment she started my back end somehow overtook my front end in some sort of physics breaking gymnastic feat as I involuntarily threw myself into the bathtub. I shouted and flopped around like a fish out of water for a few moments before regaining my senses and calming down. I realized what had happened, washed up, and made sure to warn everyone not to let her lick them. I felt so violated. I was super careful around that dog after that although she did sneak attack me one other time. I was glad when my dad re-homed her.     edit: I should note that she was specifically my dad's dog and he was horrible at raising dogs. She went to a wonderful, loving home and lived, quite literally, happily ever after.

She went to a wonderful, loving home and lived, quite literally, happily ever after.  
This was wonderful until your dad rehomed her :(

Honestly, it was for the better. My dad was terrible at raising dogs and she was kind of horrible as a result. He gave her to some neighbors who loved her, trained her, and took great care of her for the rest of her life.

That's sort of what's happening with the labrador and staffy I adopted this year at different times (coincidentally named Apollo and Athena, that I had nothing to do with!) The lab, Apollo, was spoiled rotten, severely overweight and had developed severe food aggression and has bitten people. So he's now with me and doing a lot better. Third of the size he used to be and much happier and confident.  The staffy, Athena, had zero training and zero boundaries. Has no idea how STRONG she is. She's doing so much better now she's with me!

We got two dogs back when I was in middle school. They had been taken from a home where they weren't allowed outside and only saw a woman, her two daughters, and some cats. They hated new people, attacked other dogs, but weirdly loved small children. Now, a bit over a decade later, they can walk on the street with leashes calmly, don't attack people or dogs, love to lick visitors to the house, and go to the door 90% of the time they need to go out. They are getting older and one likes to pee in the living room at 3 am so 99% success rate has dropped.  
Your title made me think of an amusing (now) and mortifying (then) story from my early adolescence. I might as well share it here.     I was home alone one day and had just gotten done using the bathroom, wiped my rear, then knelt down to fill up a bath (our tub was broken and it took lots of fiddling to get it to stop up properly). My dad's dog zoomed into the bathroom and decided to, uh, clean my unintentionally yet perfectly presented rear. I swear, the moment she started my back end somehow overtook my front end in some sort of physics breaking gymnastic feat as I involuntarily threw myself into the bathtub. I shouted and flopped around like a fish out of water for a few moments before regaining my senses and calming down. I realized what had happened, washed up, and made sure to warn everyone not to let her lick them. I felt so violated. I was super careful around that dog after that although she did sneak attack me one other time. I was glad when my dad re-homed her.     edit: I should note that she was specifically my dad's dog and he was horrible at raising dogs.

Humans are very adept in the art of butthole protecting

Yeah I don’t know how to respond at this point. I don’t think anything I can say can make it better because it’s in the TITLE. I guess today is just going to be one of those days.  
I read "I felt her cold little nose on my cheek" and thought that was pretty casual for your dog to brush up against your exposed ass, but hey we're all a little wierd with our pets.

Just own it. George Michael did when he got caught  
Esp. because they "felt the cold little nose on my cheek".  Went right along with the title up until that point!  
And the “wash out my insides” this is the best typo ever!!!

Oh the Joys of owning a dog.  One time my husband was giving our boxer-bulldog belly rubs and I warned my husband the dog was particularly gassy that day. He told me "Bowser would never do that to me" and right at that moment our dog suddenly placed his asshole right on my husbands hand and farted. I dont know what was funnier...the irony of it all or the sound it made (like a clap).  Later that night, after my husband washed his hands thoroughly, our dog went to cuddle with my husband on the couch to "apologize". He sat on my husbands lap and my husband placed his hands inside the pockets of his hoodie. The dog farted again and this time the gas went right through the fabric of the hoodie, onto my husbands hands AGAIN.  Like I said...the joy of owning a dog.

Congratulations!  
Congratulations!  
Thanks. I smoked for 45 years and probably tried to quit a thousand times. Now I’m addicted to nicotine lozenges. Lol  
I’m feeling the same. My wife were spending almost  $200 a week on cigarettes so the money is nice. It also helps that almost nobody smokes anymore.  
I quit a month ago and it really is the best time! I mean, I'm not out at the bar or working with smokers anyway. And I can't just run out for a pack either. I too am still addicted to nicotine, but patches lol  
Sorry about your brother 😕  
Thank you.  
Thanks. I smoked for 45 years and probably tried to quit a thousand times. Now I’m addicted to nicotine lozenges. Lol  
My husband quit about six months ago, and has been using nicotine patches since then. If you find the lozenges are getting too pricey, we buy the 21mg patches and cut them into four pieces with no ill effects. At this point it's more of a low level stimulant/nootropic than an actual smoking cessation aid.

I stayed the same weight, but lost fat and gained muscle when I quit.  I knew that I was likely to want to replace it with food, so I got a ton of snacks that would keep me busy like sunflower seeds.  Then any time I got a craving, I made myself work out until it was gone.  They were only 2-10 minutes long, but those spurts of exercise 6 times a day did wonders. It's been almost 10 years now since I quit.  Have never had a lapse, but now I'm fat and lazy. 👍

That’s amazing! Congrats! If you’re a reader you should read Allen Carr’s easy way to stop smoking. Not because you need it, you obviously are already an ex-smoker, but the way he breaks down the psychology of smoking will blow your mind (and maybe even help you get past the lozenges). He smoked three packs a day and it eventually killed him but not before he quit and wrote that excellent book. You can probably borrow it from the library.

Very cool recommendation. Never smoked but it sounds like a good read.

I guess not. I was usually in there first thing in the morning for cigarettes and this was a late afternoon milk run.

Awesome and congrats! Something I like to say instead of "I quit," is "I don't smoke." It's just like a small semantics thing but it feels so much better to say for me. Smoking is something I just don't do anymore. Saying "I quit" makes me feel like I stopped doing something I was supposed to be doing. Keep it up!

Good for you. I could only quit when i got into vaping. Went from a pack a day, which on average is about 35-50 mg if nic a day to 3mg/mL and i vape about 5mL a day now most of the time less. So I'm at max 15mg a day now without all the tar and other chemicals that come with smoking. If the lozenges work and you're not getting all the extra chemicals that's what matters 👍

Great decision! I smoked for 41 years and quit after some pretty serious surgery. They had me in the hospital for 14 days, and after that just didn't pick them up again. I can definitely recommend a morphine drip to take the edge of quitting. It's been 3 years and I still get the occasional urge, especially if I am doing a little drinking, but haven't been seriously tempted to pick it back up. Sure like not spending $90 a week (carton and a half) as well. Again, way to go!

Awesome congrats. I only smoked for 8 years but was proud to quit cold turkey over two years ago now. Such a filthy habit and you’ll be glad you quit once you encounter other smokers.  Only thing I have from time to time are minor nicotine cravings, but never a craving to smoke an actual cigarette, which is weird.  It’s hard to get out of the routine of smoking. for me, it was a struggle when I was commuting, because I would have a cig routinely at certain periods of my commute so I wanted to start again early on just so I had that routine back.  Keep at it.  
No Thanks, I quit
Went to the convenience where I used to get cigarettes, and the dude knows me so he goes to grab a pack for me, but I stop him and tell him I dont smoke anymore. Then proceed to buy a lighter and rolling papers lol

Fitful. I once quit for 1.5 years about 30 years ago. Always kicked myself for starting again. Quit several more times but never for very long. Rally, it was more about the money. Between my wife and me, we were spending about $9k a year. That blew my mind. Plus none of my friends smoked. My doctor was constantly on my ass about to a point I hated going to see her.

$9k for smoking? I hope not. I am not from the US and that seems huge. But yeah I figured you wanted to help out in whatever way you can. I hope this time it’s for good and you are doing great so far. Keep it up!

Now is the time to quit. I quit 3-4 weeks ago and used to only buy from local gas station. COVID19 is killing smokers. Quarantine yourself and get past those first couple of weeks. Just don't let yourself leave your home. You need your lungs for this.

quit cold turkey this year on the 1st and was able to get to the 5th of jan before i had a cigg at my parents. i always hated ciggs but i love cigars and smoking from a pipe and inhaled because i guess im just ridiculous but after that cigarette i honestly had no urge like the way i use to. i feel a million times lighter and better  
No Thanks, I quit
Congratulations!  I smoked for 25 years and next week it will have been 14 years since I quit.  There were times that I almost smoked, but since I never wanted to go through the quitting process ever again, that always stopped me.  Now sometimes I even forget that I ever smoked.  And I was one of those people who really didn't think they could quit.  Part of me really didn't want to.  But I had to have major surgery and could not walk for a long time and couldn't drive for even longer.  No one would get them for me, so I had to go cold turkey.  When I could finally drive again and I went to the grocery store, the smell of fresh fruit hit me like a ton of bricks and I burst into tears.  I had not realized how much smoking had robbed me of my sense of smell. Part of you will always miss the way nicotine made you feel.  But never look back, never let yourself believe you can just have one.  It isn't worth it.   Again, congratulations!

Quitting is awful! It’s one of the easiest/hardest things there is. I quit on the day after my birthday. We had a party and I woke up the next morning and didn’t smoke. Had a 2 hour drive back home and feared the anxiety of traffic with no smokes on top of being hungover.  Driving along, hit traffic, anxiety. Look down to my cup holder, there’s a fucking lone cigarette just chillin in my change cup. Ooooh man. I’ll wait until I get out of this traffic so I can see if I’ll want it. I’ll just wait until I get home to see if I’ll want it more and it’ll be the best..or worst cigarette. I’ll just wait until....I’m still waiting with that same 6 year old cigarette.  Figured out, having just 1 left, I Only Had One left. If something came up and I was just forced by my brain to smoke. I only had 1. I didn’t have to buy a pack and have 19 left. Just one left.  Congrats dude.  The easiest way to quit smoking is to keep thinking you’ll smoke and keep waiting for the right situation to smoke that last one.  
No Thanks, I quit
That's fantastic! I have to admit, i'm at the end of a night of drinking, so i squintingly saw "i regularly buy used cigarettes" and was concerned for a second.  Well done, maybe tomorrow you'll inspire me to quit as well : D

I recall reading that your lungs recover about 10 years after you quit. So damage is not totally irreversible. I like that a lot.

That is great OP, congratulations on kicking a very nasty habit to the curb. I used to be a heavy smoker until I quit 15 years ago, I still get urges from time to time, but you just need to remind yourself why you are doing this -- your health, and the loved ones supporting you. By the way, if you don't have any loved ones supporting you just remember I love you and I support you, never give in.

Awesome! Fights over smoking cost me my marriage.  It was costing hundreds of dollars per month for my wife to smoke and we fought about it for years.  It finally hit a tipping point and caused the end of us.  I watched my grandparents die of lung cancer and I’ll be damned if I am going to watch my wife die of it.

Hell yes, comrade. Good on ya. Fear of being more vulnerable to COVID done scared me off death sticks, hopefully for good. Haven't had one in 3 weeks today.  The first week of isolation I didn't leave my apartment for a second.

I work in an ER, and almost every time we ask the history of a patient and we get to smoking, we always give a "congrats" when they say former smoker. It's usually a brief ray of sunshine compared to 10-year COPD patients with a 30-year history of smoking.

I want to quit. I’m wondering if there’s anyone that has had a similar experience to mine who has successfully quit and can give me advice?  I’ve been smoking for 13 years. I’ve tried quitting several times. I get as far as 3 days with no nicotine. I’ve tried the patches, gum and the JUUL but so far nothing sticks.  I’ve asked doctors for a prescription to help, but they won’t prescribe my anything.  The thing is, I’m not a pack-a-day smoker. I smoke 3-10 cigarettes per day. I have a routine. I smoke one in the morning with my coffee before work, one at lunch time, and one right after work.... all with coffee or chai tea (caffeinated or decaf), then I may smoke more at night depending on if I drink or not.  But the thing is, I always thought it would get better/easier to quit with age considering I go out drinking less and less and I want to start trying to have kids.  I’m 31 now and it’s getting worse. Much worse with the Pandemic.  I need to find better coping mechanisms, and figure out a way to still have the hand-to-mouth motion without actually smoking. I try using the JUUL and I use it from time to time (3 days max usually) but I feel like I huff on it more than actually smoking cigarettes, so I feel like it might be worsening a nicotine addiction for me (verses just a habitual addition). Any advice would be extremely appreciated.

I quit too! We shut down here on a Tuesday. My last night of work before that was Saturday. Tuesday’s are my Monday. But I ended up feeling super sick Sunday-Wednesday. I called in on Tuesday cause I hadn’t gotten out of bed. Then I got the text that work was closing for the foreseeable future.  Because I was too sick to get out of bed I didn’t smoke for four days just naturally. I haven’t picked it back up and that was the 15th of last month. Feels so good. I can workout without losing my breath again!  Now to work on kicking alcohol and sugar.

He chooses a random one and says something to the effect of “come on these people aren’t actually real are they? This is crazy. Tim’s  sandwich isn’t named after someone real right?

That's not a terrible idea, because it shows a sense of humor. In small business we say that you hire for personalities and train for skills. finding someone with a sense of humor who can work well as part of a team is way more valuable than somebody who meets A B and C check marks, because the check marks are easy to train, but somebody that can jump into the team is hard to find. An easy-going manner and a sense of humor on the other hand, those are things that are priceless.

Well I guess you can call them "take a look what you have in your fridge and make some pasta with it" dish lol.  Oh but I once made myself a grilled cheese with ciabatta, spinach, a bit of garlic, mozarella, feta and sriracha (not really a tomato based product but it's red so I'm gonna count it anyway lol) and it was magnificent.

There was this local place called King David Dogs. The work crew would go every Friday. They had the classics "chili", "chicago", etc, but also had ones with and egg on top, one with just hot peppers, one with mac and cheese, and a whole bunch of others, even one with fries on top. One day some asked them if they could take the chili dog, put mac and cheese on it, bacon, and some ranch. They agreed and started working and smone other coworked says, "eeeewwww, that's a bad decision!" The next week we came in and on a hand written add on to the menu was the "bad decision dog". It stayed on the menu for years until they closed.

I am going to make an educated guess here; you are a vegetarian. If not, that still sounds like an excellent vegetarian pizza. And having a food named after you is great. Count Chocula was always  "Stoked" about it.

Alternative cheeses sound inspiring. Your choice of feta? I have to do a chef's kiss to that choice. Lumps of halloumi, paneer might work well. And pesto? Maybe mixed into the sauce. Or brushed on top lightly. I may have to start experimenting with pizza recipes again based on this.

God damn do I agree. I have never liked meat on my pizza. (In all honesty I think it stems from this one time I got a chicken pizza from papa johns when I was kid, and that night I had the worst hive outbreak I’ve ever had in my life. I also don’t eat pork. And beef is just not a meat I associate with pizza). But. I do make an exception on the no meat rule for one particular pizza from one particular place. Blaze Pizza. If you’ve ever been, you should try The Green Stripe. It’s so damn good. It has grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, garlic, mozzarella, and arugula with pesto drizzled on top of it all. I also ask for extra pesto and arugula.

When I was homeless and living in my car for 3 years  my high school friend who owned a boutique chopped salad pizza joint would always be telling me to come by. I go about once a month, not to mention impose and order steak strips, mushroom, their caramelized onion and fresh leaf basil, drizzle of olive oil after it came out While sitting with me one night after it got a slow I offered my friend a slice. He liked it so much he put it on the board as The Hobo Pie. But years before that while on vacay in St Lucia I was stung one evening by a big ass mthfkn centipede on the foot.. it nearly killed me from shock of the pain.  Centipedes are widely feared and loathed throughout the world and St Lucia is no different.  Well naturally the whole half of the island heard of the tourist who took a 15" inch centipede bite and was still walking around, albeit more of a hobble, and wasn't on the next flight home, making me a cause celebre.  Now we especially enjoyed the local drink - Piton Beer, light crisp and refreshing like Corona but more so and the local distilled Bounty Rum, again light and very blond and sweet, perfect with the local ginger ale So one morning a few days after the bite we're pouring a few drinks as we are dressing for lunch - I poured a Piton into a short glass left it on the dresser to settle and stepped in the bathroom. The wife comes out of the bathroom and thinking the Piton is ginger ale adds a copius shot of Bounty Rum. I said Hey... she said Oops as I took a sip. Not only was it not bad, it was pretty good.  We go to lunch at the resort's bar on the beach and ask our friends behind the bar if anyone had ever ordered this drink. Well the upshot is we stayed 2 more weeks and in thst time the bar had a new drink on their board... The Centipede- 12 oz of Piton, 2 shots of Bounty Rum. The next year we go back, first day walking thru town, I hear a call go up from across the street, "Hey Centipede... you came back!" Looking over I see an arm extended in a big friendly wave above the heads of a small group of people.  Lovely island, lovely people. I was blessed to have known such a place

I'm a brewer, and I did this with one of our regulars. He's an older guy from Britain, and not only are he and his wife regulars, but they do a lot of work around the brewery, like landscaping, in trade for free beer. I made an English style brown ale, and he gave it the highest compliment I've received for one of my beers, telling me it was the best brown ale he'd had since coming to the states. So naturally, I had to name it after them.

That is awesome. We have an “After Eight” cappuccino at our cafe that we added to the menu because a regular always ordered a normal iced cappuccino with a squirt of peppermint and shaved chocolate on top, and it actually tastes like the chocolate. In the description it says “If you don’t like it blame (his name) from Denmark.” He thinks it’s hilarious.

I'm guessing: cocktail named a diminutive form of /u/cosmicpu55y, perhaps "cosmic" or maybe a 'pu55y vodka'. They told their friends of this on return, so their friends started calling them that instead

When I lived in Dallas there was a bar I used to go to and I'd order double whiskeys and coke in a tall glass... eventually it evolved to a "Me double" which was literally a tall glass of whiskey and a splash of coke (which I would drink a few a night) turns out they were part of a money laundering scheme by a (mob) family who owned restaurants and laundromats. I simply help sucked down the liquor so TABC wouldn't catch on. Also I got more drinks for free than I can remember.

When I was growing up, regularly eating together was my family’s way of keeping connected (and still is to this day), so I have a connection with certain foods to family. Living in Oklahoma Sushi restaurants weren’t too common until a few years ago, but my grandparents used to eat at this small sushi place in the early 2000s and my grandpa always ordered his “special” roll. That place is now a popular chain with multiple locations and still serves the “Jim’s Crab Roll”. He passed in Feb 2019 and every time we eat at their place I make sure to order his roll.

I legitimately was walking wrong for most of my life. I was seeing a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner, and I was telling him how my knees always hurt and I was having lower back pain and I was too young for this. He immediately said go walk, let me watch you. I took four steps and he said "you're walking wrong". I was keeping my back stiff and my legs too straight, I don't know why. I was walking like a zombie. He told me to focus on lowering my butt as I walked, like I was trying to sit down in a chair. My knee pain cleared up in like a month and hasn't come back in many years.

He immediately said go walk, let me watch you. I took four steps and he said "you're walking wrong". I was keeping my back stiff and my legs too straight, I don't know why. I was walking like a zombie. He told me to focus on lowering my butt as I walked, like I was trying to sit down in a chair. My knee pain cleared up in like a month and hasn't come back in many years.  
I just spent the last 20 minutes trying to figure out how I normally walk. First I just tried walking the way you described your old walk. Felt awkward but I actually did feel like I was moving faster. Then I tried walking like how your dude described walking, by lowering my butt as I walked. That also felt really awkward. Ended up settling on a lazy version of the marching I did back in high school marching band 11 years ago. Not sure if that's how I normally do it, but it'll get me through my day.

I swear I am not stupid. But when I was 18 I bought an electric tooth brush. I would apply paste to the bristles, turn it on and try to shove it in my mouth as fast as possible without slinging the paste everywhere.  One morning, my then girlfriend looked at me and asked “why don’t you turn it on after you put it in your mouth?” Top 5 the dumbest I’ve ever felt in my life.

I started taking showers when I was 3 or 4, mom just had me figure it out! So I guess that's just how I always did it and never questioned it? It's not something anyone ever talks about, ans movies never show the wait time between turning on the shower and stepping in  I want to blame this on that lol

This post honestly just made my day, this is so innocent and hilarious. I've had these types of things in my life before where someone questions the way I do something, shows me a waaaay easier way to do it and I'm blown away - of course I can't recall anything specific right now but I know how it feels.

I am seriously questioning everything i do right now. Maybe i drive the wrong way but no one corrected me? Or maybe I'm putting on clothes the wrong way. Hell I might have been shaving wrong this whole time

Maybe you're wiping your butt wrong... EDIT: Wow, I was just joking. I didn't expect a full on butt wiping debate to ensue. Reddit never fails to surprise me, lol. I would like to say that both sitting AND standing are fine, as long as you're going front to back, apparently there are actually people who have been wiping their butts wrong...

I honestly wonder to myself like “am I walking right?” Like we learn how to walk from such a young, wobbly age, what if I do it weird and I have totally the wrong posture or something while doing it?? Haha. I feel you.

I was 23 the first time someone corrected me and said “ you don’t “rub” up your car, you “rev” it up”  I also learned last year that Metallica the band, it metal music with a metal name. I’m an idiot.

 So I guess that's just how I always did it and never questioned it?  It's funny -- I find that to be the case with a lot of habits/skills learned when you're very young. It's like your now-capable mind can't possibly see how to do things better because that's just the way it is. I was the same way with wiping -- I crumpled the toilet paper until... my mid twenties? I don't know what led me to finally try folding, but oh man, I endured a lot of years of low quality wiping for no reason.

One of the hotels I stayed at in New York City has a little cut out in the glass for the shower so that you can reach in and turn the shower on without actually getting in there it was great. Edit: took a picture I thought it was so neat

I dated a guy once who took baths because he hated washing his hair in the shower. He would use a cup as soon as he got in the tub and wash his hair. Wtf??  He said he He always got soap in his eyes? I asked a few more questions and found out he never once thought to turn around with his back to the shower and rinse his hair. This was not a stupid man by any measure.  He felt stupid when I explained showers to him though. You would have thought it would have clicked when he saw someone showering on TV at least.  Nope.  I changed that man’s entire life. Edit: WOW! Thanks for the Gold!

I mean, I just close my eyes, rinse hair, rinse face, hand squeegee my eyes. Never had any issues.  You're telling me this dude just reverted back to being a child, taking baths and using a cup to rinse his hair? I can't believe people like this are just walking around. Haha

I don't understand the cup thing. Why not just dunk your head under the water? If you're big, just put your feet up the wall and scoot down onto your back and dunk your head.

Toddlers and small children's biggest concerns in life are twofold. Making sure they get a turn with whatever toy is of current interest to someone else, and NOT getting shampoo in their eyes. However, they are super bad at following directions and keeping their eyes closed. It's pretty common for parents to have their wee ones lean their head back and then dump a cup of water over their hair to get the shampoo out while taking a bath. This gentleman appears to have gone back to that tried and true system after finding that devising a new system for showers, like closing one's eyes, was just too confounding.

Plus, you need to just close your eyes, not squeeze them shut as people do when they're trying hard. It seems to just stream the suds directly to the eyeball.

This thread is blowing my mind. I suddenly realize, we mostly don't train people to take showers. We just throw them in there and let nature take its course. And it's a solo activity that we rarely see realistic depictions of in visual media out of a combination of tedium and squeamishness about nudity . . .   It's basically the perfect storm for cultural transmission of knowledge failure. Coooool.

Which explains why one of my coworkers doesn’t wash their ass and smells like shit. Wash your poop hole people! Yes, with soap. Yes get up there. EDIT: ok fine, some people don’t use soap apparently. I’ve used soap just fine and didn’t die and I don’t smell like ass. My point is some people come out of showers and still smell bad when they skip washing vital must-clean spots like armpits and pubic areas and ass, etc.

My shower head is low enough and I'm tall enough that trying to do it backwards means I need to crane my neck back so far and crouch down so I look like a dinosaur yelling at the sky. So I just...close my eyes and lean forward?  Now you've got me wondering if I'm just doing it wrong hahaha

Pro tip: bow head, close eyes, put head right under the water stream and open your mouth wide. You will be able to rinse your hair really well and breathe through your mouth.

Close the door. The steam builds up and keeps the room warm. Dry off inside the shower, keeps you warmer as well, plus saves you from getting everything wet. I use to live in my parents basement in highschool, and we never had heat, so in winter that downstairs area was like 20 degrees (F). Showers were my favorite thing, because I could get the bathroom nice and warm for a little while.

Why not dry yourself when you shut off the shower? That's what I usually do. You'll have left over warmth and you just hope into your clothes when you get out.

I realized a couple months ago that rather than struggling to get the stupid plastic shield thing off the deodorant so I could use it, I could just click the deodorant up a little bit and easily pull it off. 30 years old and I never made the connection. I've used my husbands pliers to grab on to that thing before because I was so frustrated with it.  Edit: I'm glad I'm not the only one!

Haha the only time I've done this is if other people need to use the bathroom, I'll undress behind the curtain, chuck all my clothes out and then start it. And then shriek at the cold water until it turns warm hahaha. otherwise I'm running that until it's piping hot before I jump in

If you have an adjustable shower head, you can point it straight downwards so it's not hitting you while you wait for it to warm up in that situation.

I do that. I also organize the silverware by type in each little cup while I'm loading the dishwasher so when I unload it I can just grab a handful and put them in the drawer without having to sort everything afterwards.

Since I first learned to shower as a little kid, I followed this sequence - Wash face, then body, then hair. For years I wrestled with having to re-rinse all the shampoo down. It did not occur to me until I was 34 years old - change the sequence! Hair, then face, then body. No repeat rinse, and the hair was already drip - dry by the time I was done. So much more efficient! I felt like a genius - a really dumb genius.

I had a similar realization. I was having issues with bumps on my back/neck/shoulders. Somebody suggested washing my body after rinsing my hair. Previously I always washed my hair, put in conditioner, washed my body, and rinsed the conditioner. Now I wash my hair, put in conditioner, wait a bit to enjoy the warm, rinse, then wash my body and I am sure to wash my neck well. No more issues

After fucking up my coat zipper like three times in a row tonight, my coworker said “not to talk to you like a five year old, but can I show you how to zip up your coat?”. And just put one finger in front of his zipper to push back the fabric from his coat as he was zipping, and it zipped flawlessly. Felt like an idiot that hadn’t occurred to me before.

Well, a friend recently busted out laughing when she watched me take a pill. I drink water, hold it in my cheeks, then squeeze the pill through my lips like a reverse sphincter 😂 It never occurred to me to put the pill in first, then drink water. Edit: So after all the recommendations to tilt my head back, rather than force feed the pill through, I gave it a try with my vitamins...but it did not work. I ended up swallowing a bunch of air with my pill and water.  I like my sphincter method lol EDIT EDIT: I once again took everyone’s advice this morning. I went through my whole routine, but instead of struggling to swallow while looking up, only to be left with a pill still in my mouth, I looked down. Holy Shit! I couldn’t even tell I was swallowing a pill! Why did this take me decades to figure out? No one ever taught me to take pills obviously...thank you redditors!

This is how my fiance has to take pills. She can't take the pill and follow with water or she can't get it down. I'm the exact opposite, I can take the pill dry, or take it and follow with water, but water then pill, nope can't do it without gagging. Brains are weird.

I did try taking it the “correct way” , and nope, I couldn’t do it either!

Well, a friend recently busted out laughing when she watched me take a pill. I drink water, hold it in my cheeks, then squeeze the pill through my lips like a reverse sphincter 😂 It never occurred to me to put the pill in first, then drink water. Edit: So after all the recommendations to tilt my head back, rather than force feed the pill through, I gave it a try with my vitamins...but it did not work. I ended up swallowing a bunch of air with my pill and water.  I like my sphincter method lol EDIT EDIT: I once again took everyone’s advice this morning. I went through my whole routine, but instead of struggling to swallow while looking up, only to be left with a pill still in my mouth, I looked down. Holy Shit! I couldn’t even tell I was swallowing a pill! Why did this take me decades to figure out? No one ever taught me to take pills obviously...thank you redditors!  
No no no no no. Water first, pill second is a sometimes vital tactic. Have you ever had to take medicine that doesn't have one of those coatings over top? The kind that will immediately start dissolving as soon as it hits water? The kind that is so bitter you are in danger of gagging if you taste it? You cannot do pill first water second with those meds. You must drop the pill into your water filled mouth. I've had to take a prescription medication since I was 5 years old so I am immensely more comfortable and skilled at the water first pill second method though so I do it that way every time. Edit: I had no idea this would be such a heated topic. It is fascinating to hear how different people's pill-taking experiences can be.

For years I thought the word "original" meant plain and boring, something everyone did. Common. This was because, as a kid, 'original flavoured' crisps tasted boring and plain.

I was far into my 20’s before I learned that bludgeon did not mean sodomy.   I was a kid in the early 90's, watching some true crime documentary with my mom.  There was a story about three teens who killed their friend.  They cut her, bludgeoned her, and burned her alive.   I asked Mom what did "bludgeon" mean, and she must not have been paying any attention at all because she replied "it means they stuck it up her butt."   For the next 15 years, every time I saw something on the news like "80 year old woman bludgeoned to death in her home" or "Man bludgeoned with a baseball bat on Pine Street" I thought these people were being brutally sodomized.   I grew up thinking that people murdered each other by violently shoving large blunt objects into each other's assholes.

I feel you there OP. I normally place the shower head away from me, while awkwardly karate chopping the water from the safe distance until I feel it's hot. Like a naked ninja. It never occurred to me to just....wait. ​ EDIT: My first reddit medal! Never would have thought this would have been why but hey, can't complain.

My husband does this. He is 45. I've tried to correct him, but he just can't do it without shaking his head. The worst thing about it is that I will now occasionally see our 5 year old son doing this.

I accidentily sat on the tiny skinny part in the middle of the night (1 or 2 am), not realizing the toilet seat was up. I felt all gross and nasty after that to the point where it took awhile to fall asleep. How did you manage this for 20+ years. Edit: I didnt fall asleep on the toilet. I meant afterwards when I went back to bed.

So that’s how it happens! One of the popular comment threads on this post is about a guy that sat on the rim of the toilet instead of using the seat and the comments on that post thought no one had taught him to use a toilet. On the contrary, they must’ve just been taught wrong! 😅

Twice. ​ I couldn't figure out how to brush my teeth without foaming out of my mouth and toothpaste dripping down my chin... the answer was to just spit it out in the middle of brushing. I noticed someone do it in a movie and caught on at about 23 years old. ​ Also, the sun visors in cars were always annoying to me because they stuck out right at your face when in use. At 33 my husband pointed out that they can be flipped all the way to point to towards the windshield instead. ​ I'm a pretty smart person with a family and a successful career.

My dentist told me to spit without rinsing! It's so that the fluoride in the toothpaste can sit on your teeth longer.

I've been in here laughing at how oblivious these people are but I actually struggled with the tooth paste running down my arm thing. I guess I didn't really struggle, though, because I didn't see it as a problem until I got married and my ex-wife was like, "wtf dude." My solution was just to keep my mouth closed around the toothbrush while I brush. After I finish my first pass, I spit, rinse, and go at it again with my mouth open for simultaneous brushing and visual inspection.  Edit: Also, your username speaks to me.

Would depend on the shower, I guess. If you have a shower/tub combo, just let it run through the faucet into a bucket before switching it to shower. If its just the shower kind, you may have more troubles.

I remember thread from a very long time ago about a chaps wife who never had showers because they are always cold to start with, she mentioned it one day in front of her daughter and husband and they both look at her like she's obviously off her head, and pointed out the obvious fact. So please don't feel that you're alone in overlooking this one fact.

Oh my God that's awesome! I'm glad you finally got to enjoy a shower This is reminding of how much I hated baths as a kid because my mom would make me lean back and put my head and face under the tap when she washed my hair. I hated it so much because it hurt my back, I couldn't breathe, and I had to have my eyes squeezed shut the whole time. I didn't realize how unnecessary all that was until last week when my girlfriend was babysitting her nephew and I saw her use a bowl to just gently pour the water over his head. It blew my mind.

But at least now you know how to deal with being waterboarded.  
Think that's cool? Try wiping the water off yourself before going for the towel.  GAME CHANGED  
I realized this sometime around 6th grade. I could get dry quicker by using my the edge of my hands to slide the water off my body. Get dry quicker and my towel isn’t still wet by time I get home from school for my evening shower. I tried to figure out what else I could optimize in my morning routine then in my life. Probably had a big impact on how I approach problem solving in general.

Similarly, when getting out of the shower I would just kind of hold the towel around myself like a blanket and shiver until I was dry enough for clothes. Turns out you can use the towel to wipe the water off and spend less time being cold.

Here’s one for you. Being  raised by a single mother most of the time in a house with grandmother, aunt, and two female cousins i always stepped out of the shower with the towel around my chest and went thru my whole life like that up until i moved in with my then girlfriend at 20ish. One day i walk out of the shower to her sitting on the bed giggling to herself as she asked me why don’t you just put the towel around your waist?....i had never thought to do that, i didn’t have an answer for her since I’ve always done it that way. We are still friends and she still teases me about it till this day. 8 years later

I didn’t learn how to swim until I was an adult. I always got so out of breath and couldn’t figure out how people could swim fast or long distances because I was holding my breath when underwater and trying to breathe out and in when my head was turned. One day my friend asked me why I didn’t breathe out while my head was underwater so that I only had to breathe in when I turned my head. At first I told her that was impossible and then I thought about it and realized she was totally right. I felt so dumb but it made swimming sooooo much easier!

I do... This was a few years ago, before my husband and I were matried, but we'd been living together for years. It is a standard that if one of us is out of work, they do more around the house. I was unemployed and therefore doing most of the chores and he kept leaving spoons with peanut butter globs still stuck to them. Basically he'd get a GIANT spoonful of peanut butter and then not finish it. He would leave the spoons in water, but as I'm sure some people here have noticed, that does pretty much nothing to break peanut butter down, not like a crusty spaghetti fork or something.  I got kind of mad at him, and asked him to stop doing that since it didn't actually help and kind of grossed me out and he got upset back. I don't really remember what he said (neither does he, as he spent the night mindblown, like OP) but it was something along the lines of, "So what I'm just supposed to let it get dry or force myself to eat it all?" I said "No, just wipe it off with a napkin!" The look on his face, I might as well have been explaining theoretical quantum thermodynamics, if that is even a thing.  So now we call those moments when someone suggests a really simple and usually obvious solution that we didn't even consider Peanut Butter and Spoon moments.

I never realized there was a difference between miracle whip and mayonnaise until I was about 17 I knew that sometimes my sandwiches would taste different, but I chalked it up to the brand of cheese or meat that was being used The only reason I figured it out is because I was sitting around with my friends one day and someone said “I hate miracle whip” and I said “really? I love mayonnaise!” A roast session ensued, and I now know the difference between miracle whip and mayonnaise

I just wanted to share with you this comic: https://xkcd.com/1053/ And to let you know that this is far from the first time I've read comments on Reddit by people doing exactly the same. You are not alone. But at least now you can enjoy warm showers and you are one of today's lucky 10,000.

It took me about 2 hours! I ended up putting a couple of pillar candles in to light it up. I think the smile seems darker because the mouth is on a bit of an angle. It really looks like that in person too so I’m really proud!! :D

Your smile is brighter than the Cheshire Cat's, and that is really saying something because GODDAMN. That is a beautiful pumpkin. I wish I could freeze it and preserve it cryogenically for a thousand years. The next generations will respecc it, and put it in a museum maybe.

What's Halloween like in the UK?  Is it as big a deal there as it is in the US? I mean, I can tell that OP is a fan!  I was just curious about the holiday over there in general.

The trick or treating is quite a big thing although so is being a huge asshole when people knock on your door asking for sweets! Most people here celebrate it to some extent but so many people treat it as an occasion to be nasty to people for no reason, I have no idea why!

I know what you mean, we get a lot of that here too.  I've never understood the vandalism aspect that seems to come with the holiday.  Why can't we have a nice night out having fun and being spooky without bringing vandalism into it?

I’m not sure if it’s the same around the rest of the world but usually you get your ID checked in England if you’re buying eggs because it’s such a common thing to egg people’s houses on Halloween!!

Depends on your area. I don't think I've had anyone try to trick or treat near me for years, but a friend might have a Halloween party or something.  We have a traditional holiday called guy fawkes night only a few days after Halloween, so they sort of compete for holiday real estate, but generally halloween is becoming more popular due to the unending influence of American media. Plus, it gives another chance for businesses to sell us more tat. Edit: I do remember a police officer coming in to school to warn us against trying to egg teachers houses or whatever.

This a what adults do - put their kids first,  Great job for all of you to recognize what is best for all the kids and have such a great relationship- your kids will absolutely benefit.  It’s unfortunate that more parents don’t do this after a divorce!

It doesn’t even sound like they’re doing this to put the kids first. It sounds like they are legit friends who aren’t tearing themselves up over petty jealousy. Kudos to them.

I agree. Play music together isn’t “putting kids first” it’s “my ex-wife picked a pretty chill 2nd dude and I’m not going to let petty jealousy get in the way”

It's absolutely about the kids. When they divorced they remained amicable because of the kids.  When thier child struggled with abuse at school, they came together for thier kid. The other guy found even more common ground to be friendly because he had a kid. He watches his kid and vice versa for the kids. Sure it's possible this could happen without kids, but these three people set aside personal issues and everything for the kids. They chose to constantly come together, after a divorce, for the kids first. And from this common ground and common goal they all became friends. The only thing I can really extrapolate from this is the ex-wife knows how to pick reasonable dudes.

I don't think they had that many issues to set aside. They sound like the kind of people who don't have that many issues in the first place.

It started out about the kids, but now all of the adult's relationships with each other have changed. They have become a family, not just for the kids, but for each other.

Adults can't take care of the kids if none of the adults are in a good spot. I get the sentiment, but I think people don't think their own happiness, well being and calm state of mind are just as important if not more important than taking care of kids.  If you are thriving as an adult, it just means you are that much better at being able to take care of the kids.

Great point - you’re so right - we do tend to ignore our own mental health and how to help ourselves when we become parents.

Yeah. Reading the parent comment made me realise it took my parents well over ten years to get to that point. Briefly meet each other at Christmas, passive aggressive argument. Both insist on accompanying me to the hospital when I have surgery, passive aggressive argument.

Because they are still children at heart and mentally. They never learned how to be an adult.

I was a child of divorce. Honestly, I would have been fine with that if my step parents had behaved as you, your ex, and her husband have. My step mom hated my mom, my dad hated my step dad...might as well have had an "everybody hates everybody" banner right up there on the wall. Both step parents had kids of their own, and resented me and my sister. It was awful. My best friend's parents got a divorce around the same time, but they remained friends for the benefit of the kids. My friend and his brother have grown up to be a great and well put together guys, while my sister and I struggle. Parents need to put their own shit aside for their kids. Watched a movie recently called Wildlife. Its about 2 parents basically forgetting about their own son and the impact the things he is witnessing will have on him as they go through an intense breakup/eventual divorce. It really hit home with me

This isnt what adults do. Adults are cordial and raise the kids together. They dont make their ex husbands god fathers to their new husbands children.  This is FANTASTIC but probably the first time its happened ever in history.  As someone who has raised another mans baby for 20 years, i appreciate this.

My parents did this. My mom and dad stayed civil, always civil, and mom always told us that our dad paid his child support every month. And we should be proud of that.  And she refused to say bad things about him though there were a few she could have. Never did.  And my stepdad and mom always invited my dad to Thanksgiving and Christmas, and my dad had us all at his house the next day for his traditional spaghetti dinner. Every year, and it very rarely when South.  And dad and stepdad were liberal and conservative. Both fairly polarized. Yet they STILL were fine. Occasionally one of them made a statement that the other took offense at, there were raised voices, and they separated. The.n They came together like gentlemen and apologized for saying the bad thing and setting off the other person, and the other apologized for losing their temper.  It’s been a master class in behaving like adults, respecting each other, and loving my mom and is kids, really. They gave us an incredible gift.  My SIL said we were so lucky that our parents were grownups about it, because hers were not. They literally can’t be in the same room without making a scene.  This meant that she and my brother had to elope rather than have the sweet, small wedding she wanted. She couldn’t trust her parents to behave.  My sibs and I are all very much in agreement. One has modeled his relationship with his exwife with how our parents are mature people who actually care about each other even when they’re not bound by marriage.  Best gift our parents ever gave us.

Jumping comments just to let you know you're definitely not the only people that do this. My friend invited me on a vacation with her parents, who were divorced as well. They make a super team when camping and they were crazy good friends. I had no idea what could of led to them divorcing, but that is none of my business, they were very mature like your situation. You stand out to me OP, you're more mature than a large amount of your peers.  
Thanks.  
You deserve it. Not only did all parties remain civil, but actively worked to make things better. That’s in large part to you. Well done.

When my sister married her husband 10 years ago, she did not get along with his ex-wife. There were years of drama and fighting and War over the two kids. It was a long hard road for them to come to a better understanding of each other and realize that it's the kids that are the most important. So 2 years ago my brother-in-law found a job that was close to our family across the country. when they told her they were going to move, she asked if she could move with them. So this girl packed herself up and moved 3000 miles away to be with her ex-husband's in-laws. Those three adults co-parent the two oldest children and the four new children that joined the family so well, that the new kids call her their bonus mom. My family has accepted her and pulled her in as one of our on. She has since met the love of her and is engaged and they come to all of our family parties. It is amazing what can happen when you decide to get over yourself and move forward.

Aw that's really sweet. I'm glad you are all able to get along. You're a family, even if it's not in the typical way. Your kids are lucky to have all of you.

Seriously! My parents had such a messy and drawn out divorce. They haven’t spoken to each other since 2006. I’m older now but it really hurt me when I was growing up. Your kids are incredibly lucky to see their mom and dad get along so well!

Honestly, that’s the best way to do it, my dude, and that puts a smile on my face that instead of drifting and hating your ex, you came to the conclusion that it would be best to maintain an amicable relationship. I’m thankful that my ex-husband and I are on good terms too, despite not having kids together. Proud of you!

Nah it happens more often than you think.

I understand you. My ex is still one of my best friends, but we've moved on from any romantic attraction. It honestly confuses me when people are so antagonistic with their ex. I understand we're the weird ones, but I can't seem to empathize with the "normal" divorced people.

I think it depends on why the relationship came to an end. It's often easier for people to antagonize the other person while moving on as well.

Absolutely. Everyone's situation is different and we all come to them from different places. I don't necessarily think they are wrong, I just couldn't imagine myself in their position.

I'm also on good terms with my former partners, though no kids or other complications like that.  When they're in town, I'm always down to grab dinner and catch up.  We might not be in love anymore, but I do still love them on some level for sure.  I can't excise them entirely from my lives.  It'd be unthinkable. I think it's just personality type.  People tend to cluster with people with similar personalities.  My current partner is the same way with his exes.  And now that I think on it, most of my friends are the same way too. By comparison, some of the more distant social circles I know seem to be completely full of people that are full of seething hatred for their former partners, even when there's no obvious reason for it like betrayal.

I'm still good friends with one of my ex-girlfriends. No kids, but we did adopt the sweetest and best dog that I've ever known together and she got full custody. Like what you said, we fell out of 'romantic' love with each other. Eventually we came to an understanding that our paths in life were taking us in different directions. But she's still one of my favorite people to hang out with because we get along so well, and we view each other as extended family now. It's been a point of contention in a couple relationships but as I get older it's generally less of an issue.

I feel the same. I'm closer with some then others but we shared so much of ourselves it seems wrong to give up that just because it didn't work out romantically. Plus having women who will vouch for you in the modern dating scene doesn't hurt at all.

People go from being best friends to unable to tolerate each other because the romance is over. Bums me out.

I couldn't imagine myself being friends with an ex but I have never been in a position to do so. All romantic feelings have to disappear or else there is lots of jealousy. Not sure I could handle that

Coming from a now (24yrs) child of parents who remained friends (even lived next door to each other until very recently) I can let you know how much your kids will respect and love you for this. I had an amazing childhood despite my parents being divorced since I was 6 months.  Thank you for being mature and loving your kids and your ex wife and her husband (doesn’t have to be romantic) well.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Good for you and your kids, OP. This is far from the common experience, as is the opposite end of the spectrum where everything is rage, sabotage, and competition. Most divorces are just a separation and avoidance of each other, with only necessary contact for the sake of the kids. After eight years, I don't hate my ex (for cheating on me), I feel about her like I do a stranger who happens to be the mother of my son. He has his relationship with her, and I'm happy she's part of his life. She's a good person.

I think this is fantastic...  It's a great place to be when you can genuinely care enough about the other person to actively wish for their happiness, even when it's not with you. Sounds like you're all stand up people!

 It's a great place to be when you can genuinely care enough about the other person to actively wish for their happiness, even when it's not with you.     I was a groomsman in my best friends wedding. My opposite bridesmaid? His ex.  It always brings back a little of my faith in humanity when I see folks that realize that incompatibility is not cause for hatred.

This is so absolutely touching. I hate that people would call your situation weird and that it is not the norm. Just because you got divorced doesn’t mean your ex needs to be your mortal enemy. Some people just don’t work as a couple and it takes time to learn that. I am so happy for you and I hope the school got what was coming to them because that is awful.

Me and the wife split a few months ago but are still great friends and a lot of people just don’t understand it or think it is a joke. It is sad that people expect us to be fighting etc but at end of day it is up to us how we behave and interact and why throw away the friendship we had for so long. Plus less for them to gossip about!!!

I like to explain to people who want to ask a bunch of questions or assume there's more to the story that my ex was not my best friend because she was my girlfriend, she was my girlfriend because she was my best friend. The dating thing just didn't end up working out, but that's no reason to end the friendship. Granted, the first couple months were rough for both of us as we were coming to terms with the end of the romantic relationship, but we're only human and we figured it out.

My parents and my step-parents are great friends. No bad blood between them, dinner and drinks together full of laughter and story sharing and I have always felt lucky to have that dynamic in my life.

My father’s first wife and my mother ended up being good friends as well.  We had a pool in the backyard and I would wake up in the summer to splashes from her swimming there. We had an open door policy to all friends and family.  It was really nice.

This is what my recent ex (separated in March, divorce final in June) are striving for.  We agreed on every single part of the divorce settlement and to say it was amicable is an understatement.  We're still friends, and even though the kids are 16 & 19 we still co-parent them; like this past weekend when we helped our 19-year old move out. ​ I look forward to completely getting where you are OP.  I did my best to not let it show, but I'm not at a point yet where it doesn't sting a little to see someone else living my life.  For 15 years it was my shoulder my ex cried on and to see her do that with someone else last weekend?  I won't lie... it fucking hurt.   ​ Will I ever get to the point I pay for her & her new guy to go to Rome?  I got a lot of growing to do :)  But good on you Op!  If nothing else you're teaching your children (by example and actions) that relationships can be complicated but that doesn't mean they have to be negative.

That's just plain awesome.

Takes a special kind of person to do what you have done.  Congrats man!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
That’s wonderful. Kids needs peace and stability, and even though it didn’t work out with your wife and mother of your child, you’re all still able to act like adults who look out for the well being of the kids. My husband works as a mental health therapist specializing in children (autistic kids actually) and he gets so many messed up kids because of the parents fighting each other and weaponizing them against the other parent. So you and your ex and her new husband are wonderful.

As someone who gets along with and still interacts frequently with my son’s father and his girlfriend, this makes me happy! I absolutely adore his girlfriend and so does my son, she’s come to be like a second mom. And I’ll call her sometimes when I need some help with a surprise for my son and she’ll come and work on it with me. I really appreciate having that kind of relationship with her and glad to see others are out there as well!

What happened with the school?  The teachers should have been charged with assault and cilld abuse, lost their teaching credentials and send to jail. So to with the administrators. But I’m betting that nothing happened to them and they are still assaulting  and abusing children.

This is by far, the best thing I have ever read that came out of a divorce. This gave me a warm feeling inside when I finished reading. I wish you all a wonderful rest of your lives together.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
more people should be like you  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You are a cool dude. My friend in a similar situation refers to the guy as his husband-in-law.

That's some great humor for what could be an awkward situation looking in.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
that's some next level co-parenting and family friendship right there.  you guys rock.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Good on you my man. Hope you all have a lovely time. I have yet to visit Rome but it is certainly oh my list  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
That is the best story i have ever read, years of reddit finally paid up, THank you so fucking much for sharing this story, wish you the best from the bottom of my heart dude, ill be praying for youe succes  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Divorce does not mean HATE. Good on you for maintaining a healthy relationship and making it about your kids.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
For some reason my eyes are kinda watery.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Good for you! That’s awesome. But the whole teacher aide abuse is infuriating. Why do people even want jobs like that if they hate it?? It’s bad everyone.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
What happened with the school?  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
wow thats nice  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Respect dude that's super nice  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Best thing I’ve read this week. With such a strong support system I’m sure your kids will be better off than most kids who’s parents are married and constantly fighting.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Thank you this is so heart warming.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Seriously, you are amazing. It should always be about the kids & you’ve done that. You should feel like the best guy in the world ❤️  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Op, I take my hat off to you as a parent, and as a human. Not only are you giving your kids an amazing family, a stable home life and a great example, but you are also raising the bar for what maturity should be like for the rest of us!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Fuck yeah. Good on you!!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
I'm here hours and 200 comments later and I know you probably won't see this but I have to say it. as a child of divorced parents who has struggled with mental illness most of her life I want to say thank you, I wish my parents had done what you and your ex-wife did. It makes me happy to hear that there is a family somewhere where the parents really did put their children first and I can only hope that all of you are so so happy  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Dude, you've made best of every situation. You should be very proud.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
That is such a healthy relationship between you all and it's very uplifting to see parents come together like adults. I hope y'all have an amazing time!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You are winning at being an adult, decent person and great parent and bonus dad!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Y'all sound like good people. I'm sorry for what the school did to your family and hope your son especially is doing better nowadays  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Oddly similar to our situation, right down to autistic son. Last year ex wife, wife and I went to a Beaches vacation resort for the kids, together. Long road, but so worth the work to give the kids a healthy upbringing. Go you!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
It’s buried in the comments somewhere. Check my comment history.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Nothing weird in what you are doing. Society tends to have this bad habit of judging people who are doing the right thing.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Great adult-ing. The only people who could insult you haven't lived long enough to understand better.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
This comment will only get buried, but I wanted to say you, your ex, and her husband are great parents and reasonable people. Having such a positive relationship with their mother, their younger sibling, and even their step-father is so good for you and your kids.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Bro as long as you are happy and the kids are okay. I see nothing wrong you keep doing you my man. Life is complicated nothing is ever black and white.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You are awesome. I hope the kids are doing well. Xoxoxoxo  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
I love this story. I consider my ex and his wife my family. He and I have been divorced 21 years. Our first few years apart were also a struggle to find the new relationship that worked for all of us. But eventually it did.  Last week I quit my full time job so I can  make my own schedule with my several part time gigs- I did this so I can be free to go travel to where they live so I can help her thru her second round of chemo. She has been there for me in some trying times.  It’s my turn to return the favor.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
My mom had a boyfriend when I was younger where his ex wife married his cousin and then they all hung out together all the time as pals. I went and stayed with the ex wife and the cousin (step and also regs) dad like atleast twice, they were good people and honestly it was a hilariously great arrangement. I remember the ex wife giving my mom her Costco card to use at one point which still had her married name on it. Even at 10 I was like “this is weird” but honestly it’s whatever works lol good for you OP you are one in a million.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Great story mate. Thanks for sharing. Made my day.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Your children have so many amazing role models for what healthy relationships look like, and that is truly priceless. Thanks for sharing, it’s good to know there’s still good in this world :))  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
This makes me so happy, my parents divorced over 10 years ago. My mom owns a bar sometimes my step mom picks up bartending shifts when shes bored and my dad comes in several times a week just to grab a beer and see my mom, her mother, her sister and my cousins who work there. I wish more family divorced like this, we are so lucky  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You, your ex wife, and her new husband all sound like amazing people. The world would be such an amazing place if everybody was more like you guys. I hope you enjoy your vacation, and I hope your kiddo is doing better now.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Not weird at all, man. Sometimes marriage just isn't right for two people, but you can still remain friends. My S-I-L is still friends with her ex-husband and his wife because he's really an OK guy, just wasn't the right husband for her. She ended up getting remarried and everyone is happy. Good for all for all of you for making the best of things and not just giving up and throwing away good personal relationships.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
My dad and stepdad got along much like you describe here. You're being a wonderful person, and you're doing the right thing. Thank you for sharing.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
sounds like the beginning of a murder podcast or something  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Have you told them yet? Are they freaking out?!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Good on you, man.  I'm sure it's tough but keep on doing what feels right.  Sounds like you're a great example for everyone.  Hopefully we get to hear about an awesome trip later this year.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Good for you!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You’re a good dude.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
OMG you are amazing! I wish more people were like you and your family, this world would be so much better off.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
This is awesome! I love seeing things work out with ex-partners and new partners.  I also have an autistic son. Your story made me feel physically sick. I don’t know what I’d do if anyone ever harmed him like that...probably commit murder. I hope your boy is getting on better now.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
I am overjoyed to hear this.  Relationships end. It's a sad thing, and it sucks majorly, but it's a fact of life. But when you have kids involved, you HAVE to keep things amicable. You HAVE to show the kids how to treat the people you have loved.  I'm glad you and her new husband are friends. This is such a heartwarming story.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
When I read you're the godfather it actually made me really happy. Seems like tho it didnt work as Husband and Wife you're making it work as parents. And that's so important for those kids. Good on you man. Wish there were more parents out there like you.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You're a legend man, good on you.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
I love this so much! Kudos to all of you.  I hope you meet a kind woman who fits in with all of you.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Have a great trip! I hope you find this handy guide to Italy as helpful as I do.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Dude. You rock. Co-parenting, especially with a step-parent, con be really tough. It sounds like you guys are all well-functioning adults with their priorities pretty straight. Just because a romantic relationship doesn't work out doesn't mean the two people involved have to hate one another. Seriously, I'm proud of this entire post.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
That seems like a great relationship you have with them. Not all divorces/break-ups have to end in a negative note. My dad was married before he met my mum, they had my 3 sisters together and I see her like a cool aunt rather than my dad's ex.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
As a son of divorced parents (I was 6) who were always fighting and to this day (20 years later) still can not be in the same room together, this honestly brought tears to my eyes. I'm proud of how well you guys have moved on and your action about the vacation is so admirable. Best of luck to you and your family my friend  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You are a hero to your kids. The way they see you treat there mother (and her current husband) will shape how they expect to be treated as spouses. Thanks for being an great dad in this regard. I hope the trip goes well.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You're a good dude, this is how it should be when kids are involved.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
They’re all lucky to have you.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Good for you, sir. If more families acted this way after a divorce there would be less fucked up kids in this world.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
This is honestly how a relationship with an ex should be  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You are awesome. This is awesome. Thank you for sharing!

I think you sound like a very evolved, intelligent, kind and decent person. Round of applause!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Wow, good for you. And for the kids.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
This is cool man, glad you guys handled everything like real adult humans lol ​ Sometimes people get divorced (read: my childhood) and everything is the most dramatic nuclear fire fight for no damn reason.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
You are an awesome human!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
I'm in a similar situation and I get along with them great, but there is no way I would do this haha. Hope you all have fun and I'm sure the kids will love it  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Sounds like an optimum situation for everyone. Good on you all for making it work :)  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
When I was growing up, I wish my parents were like this. Thank you for being such a good father.

Bro what a story! Happy for you all.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
That's awesome man! I was afraid this was going to end up in a dark place when you started talking about your ex-wife stashing the phone in your son's backpack but I'm super stoked to hear that things are turning out well! I hope everyone has a great time in Rome!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
This is awesome. I wish all divorced couples, especially those with kids, could be like this. The bitterness and resentment that comes with divorce hurts only the kids. So hats off to all y’all!  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Bloody fantastic. Thanks for sharing. My ex and I get on great. People look at us in sheer disbelief.  
I’m taking my ex-wife and her husband on vacation.
Adorable! Hope you guys have a lovely time there!

There are different types of families. Your family construct is as valid as any other! Go man! You and your family are awesome! I am so glad things worked out for you and that you can be happy.

I had no COVID symptoms at all, I wore a mask, and I washed my hands. Within 5 hours of waking up today I was in the ER
I hope you get better ! Sounds awful!  
I hope you get better ! Sounds awful!  
Thank you! Honestly the hardest thing is that because no visitors are allowed my wife can’t be with me. I suck at being sick and she keeps me propped up when I’m in abject misery like this lol

Oh that is even harder. I would hate to be separated from my partner as well! Has she been tested as well to make sure she is all clear? I really do wish you all the best and get well soon!

She’s fine as of now but if I’m tested positive (which seems likely right now) she’ll have to self quarantine even if she isn’t sick. I appreciate the kindness, friend. Best to you and yours as well!

Fingers crossed she is all clear too. Very troubling times we live in right now. Regardless if some people believe it or not. Everyone needs kindness now and then so I'm glad I can extend this to you today :)  
She’s fine as of now but if I’m tested positive (which seems likely right now) she’ll have to self quarantine even if she isn’t sick. I appreciate the kindness, friend. Best to you and yours as well!  
Hang in there! Stay hopeful! You got each other!  
She’s fine as of now but if I’m tested positive (which seems likely right now) she’ll have to self quarantine even if she isn’t sick. I appreciate the kindness, friend. Best to you and yours as well!  
Maybe FaceTime/Skype for several hours at a time to keep each other company? It’s a small thing but at least you can see each other’s faces that way.  Hope you get better soon :)  
She’s fine as of now but if I’m tested positive (which seems likely right now) she’ll have to self quarantine even if she isn’t sick. I appreciate the kindness, friend. Best to you and yours as well!  
My husband and I both tested positive about a month ago despite wearing masks and practically never leaving the house since March. It was NOT fun, but we made it and have recovered. Going through it together made it somewhat more tolerable. However, we continue to quarantine and only go out for work or essentials with masks because the LAST thing we want is to get sick again! If you test positive, keep the faith and take care of yourself.  
She’s fine as of now but if I’m tested positive (which seems likely right now) she’ll have to self quarantine even if she isn’t sick. I appreciate the kindness, friend. Best to you and yours as well!  
She should probably self-quarantine now anyway. Best of luck to both of you.  
She’s fine as of now but if I’m tested positive (which seems likely right now) she’ll have to self quarantine even if she isn’t sick. I appreciate the kindness, friend. Best to you and yours as well!  
OP, for what it is worth, my colleague went through this from your wife's perspective. Spouse came down with it, whole household had to quarantine, with the sick spouse quarantined to a specific room. They managed to get through it with no one else in the household getting sick (4 people in household, only the one person ever tested positive). It can be done. Stay safe and get healthy!  
She’s fine as of now but if I’m tested positive (which seems likely right now) she’ll have to self quarantine even if she isn’t sick. I appreciate the kindness, friend. Best to you and yours as well!  
Self quarantining sucks. But at least you can be around each other!

You can quarantine together if thata the case! Seriously though, having gotten it and gotten over it I know how much it sucks. I'm grateful I only transmitted it to my roommate. Have your wife quarantine now until you get the result.  
Thank you! Honestly the hardest thing is that because no visitors are allowed my wife can’t be with me. I suck at being sick and she keeps me propped up when I’m in abject misery like this lol  
I feel that dude. I turn into a 4 year old when I’m sick. Stay strong. Someone send this guy a Nintendo switch.  
Thank you! Honestly the hardest thing is that because no visitors are allowed my wife can’t be with me. I suck at being sick and she keeps me propped up when I’m in abject misery like this lol  
I am 31, was asymptomatic, had it for 1 month, never knew I had it til my mom tested positive. Then suddenly our whole house was positive. They contact traced us to our local grocery store, where the nursing home across the street had a massive outbreak.  We went shopping every 10 days. Never partied, I even wore an N95 mask to places. We carried on the go lysol spray, hand sanitizer, everything. Its not a matter of if but when. I really hope you recover and feel better soon. It was quite an experience id never wish on anyone.  
Thank you! Honestly the hardest thing is that because no visitors are allowed my wife can’t be with me. I suck at being sick and she keeps me propped up when I’m in abject misery like this lol  
I feel bad that you're sick, but I'm laughing that you admit you rely on your wife so much when you're sick. I always joke about my husband's "man-colds," but I absolutely whine when I'm sick.  I was in the hospital for 11 days last month, non-covid related. 11 days away from my husband and kids. It sucked ass. Charge your phone and facetime, because that will get you through.  
Thank you! Honestly the hardest thing is that because no visitors are allowed my wife can’t be with me. I suck at being sick and she keeps me propped up when I’m in abject misery like this lol

Trust me, you can be separated from your partner even without covid. I haven't seen my wife to be in 5 months because my country closed borders completely. I would love to be in your position.

Trust me, you can be separated from your partner even without covid. I haven't seen my wife to be in 5 months because my country closed borders completely. I would love to be in your position.  
Same. Haven't seen my wife since the end of January and both our countries shut borders (mine to hers and a few others, and hers to everybody). She doesn't have a spousal visa to come here, and I picked the wrong time to change jobs and do a visa run (a decision made all the way back in November, so go easy on me haha). Now I'm stuck at my mom's and we video chat every day. How about you?

You probably saved a lot more people than you realize from getting sick by staying vigilant. Get better soon!

Exactly. I didn’t realize how much people literally have no empathy for others till this pandemic hit.  Even if masks aren’t effective or if they do infringe on your first amendment rights (spoiler: they don’t), so what? Is it that difficult to put on a mask for the sake of others? Are we really this individualistic? Go to parts of East Asia. People regularly wear masks looooong before the pandemic. Even for just the regular flu or for allergies. People realize that there are other people in the world than them.

You would not believe the amount of people around me being so fucking dramatic about how awful it is to wear one. Just regular intelligent and often empathetic people. But this mask thing is just bringing out the most selfish and naive parts of them.  Many people just aren’t taking this seriously and get stuck in the “it couldn’t happen to me” mindset.  Most are still wearing them but not without acting like it’s a freaking ball gag or something.

I think it’s harder to wear a bra now than a mask-any day!!

I watched that video of the guy screaming about how he would die for the country and he would die for the constitution, but he refused to wear a mask to save other people in his country. That man thinks he's a patriot. I don't get it. Being a patriot means making sacrifices for the good of your country and the people in it.

Extrême Individualism. That’s the problem. Being taught that YOU have rights and YOU matter, without being taught the other side of the coin: you live in a society and other people have just as many rights  and matter just as much as you.  
People know it's not for them and that's the problem. Agree that this guy did the right thing to protect those around him. Wishing you fast healing and no lingering symptoms, OP!  
I'm always surprised by the number of people who, after receiving the explanation that masks protect the people around them by preventing spread, respond with, "But they're uncomfortable, and it's hot."  
And by wearing a mask.  Thank you for doing that.   Too many people don't realize that it's not for them,i it's for those around them.  
Can't believe we are still taking about this. IT WORKS BOTH WAYS. Yes it is more like protecting others from you, but at the same time the mask provide a decent amount of filtering, lessening viral load. And needless to say, less virus for your body to fight, the better.  
And by wearing a mask.  Thank you for doing that.   Too many people don't realize that it's not for them,i it's for those around them.  
I live in a large, busy apartment complex and am getting tired of the anxiety attacks from NO ONE wearing masks in the hallways/elevators and started calling them out. One young woman made her point very clear, and I think it exemplifies 100% of the anti-maskers: "I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU."  
You probably saved a lot more people than you realize from getting sick by staying vigilant. Get better soon!  
Agree. COVID has very common symptoms. It's more worth it to be paranoid over a simple cough than not.

This is kind of my take on it too. I'm doing everything I can to prevent catching this, but even if I get it I'm not this viruses tool.  Getting me sick is an evolutionary dead-end: I will not get anyone else sick. And it is really left me thinking about how accepting we are of sickness. Going to work sick, toughing it out, etc... diseases spread around the world through our apathy. it's going to be interesting seeing the studies of how other diseases were impacted by our increased awareness about Covid.  In areas that had populations that largely follows guidelines, was the flu season decreased greatly? Even beyond covid-19. How many lives could we be saving if we were all just a bit more aware and less accepting of the idea that we all inevitably just get sick.  Like it is some magical thing that just happens on a schedule as opposed to an infectious agent being spread from person to person.  
I assume you are in America? I always feel sorry for you guys when it comes to health care. Can't understand the resistance to free health care, but I hear some of the arguments and a couple of them make some sense but seriously guys , we get choice of private health care which is cool cause it lets us go to private hospitals with Dr of our choice. Public is still great but food is shit and 4 ppl per room etc. I have had 2x back surgeries in public hospital by the best neuro surgeon in the area because all specialists are required to  oversee public hospital wards as well as private ones. It's a bit complicated but all up we get great health care which is free when you need it.  
There are plenty of Americans (me included) who want free healthcare. The ones who don't are super rich, or super fucking stupid and are being manipulated by the super rich people...

This! If you have it, go out and spread it you are eventually killing people, weather directly or indirectly (person who gets it from you gives to the person it kills). How can you live with yourself knowing there were simple things you could do to prevent this and you have killed people?

I just got out of the hospital and I don't wanna go back. Three people in my ward died in two days - it was really awful to hear.

It would be terrifying to be in there and hear that people are dying around you from the same thing you have, getting the same treatment you are. Fuck. I'm glad you pulled through.

I tested positive yesterday, I've been doing the same and I'm compromised I have lung issues. So I'm terrified. I also have seen my boyfriend in weeks because of it and it's awful. Good luck I hope you feel better, stay strong x

I lived in the US for 20+ years before I left to immigrate to a country with a reasonable healthcare system and strong public infrastructure. Honestly, it's so much worse than even Reddit says. The average redditor is white middle class, so even though the system sucks for them, it's sooo much worse for lower class people or those who live in underprivileged areas (which unfortunately many people of color do). I have no regrets about leaving. It was like a living nightmare knowing my life could basically be over at any point due to getting seriously sick and being refused treatment, or worse, surviving and being in ridiculous amounts of debt. I'm so much more at ease being able to go to a hospital any time I need and know I'll never pay more than like $20, if even that. I make 40k a year and my tax burden for universal healthcare is only ~$60 a month. It's heaven compared to the US.

Might I ask what country? Am a teen about to leave home and I'd personally like to live somewhere else as well, even if I have to start over socially/financially.

Where did you move to and how? My husband and I are seriously considering moving out of the US cuz shit is going so far downhill here, but it seems so difficult/crazy expensive to do so, not to mention visas and whatnot.

South Carolina is going crazy. It’s so annoying seeing people outside: I’d estimate that 50% of people don’t wear masks where I am.

I am in Texas (Houston area) and it’s a hot spot too. Sorry that you are sick. Get plenty rest. I do hope that you get well soon (and it’s not COVID).

It took you four hours to be seen with chest pain? That’s insane.  
It really depends on the level of pain and other symptoms. It's of course different in every country but where I'm from the ER is for actual emergencies. If you can walk/get there on your own and you're not bleeding all over the floor, that already pretty much puts you at the end of the line in most cases as there are always people quite literally ready to kick it who are a priority.  I've had pretty damn painful chest pain from simply having gas. So that alone isn't always enough. One time I developed a whole body discoloration after taking some medication, and I was seriously scared I might go into anaphylactic shock as I had never had that level of an allergic reaction to anything. And the description on the medicine said to see a doctor if an allergic reaction happens. I still ended up waiting 5 hours in the ER because as I got there on my own and didn't display any respiratory symptoms, they didn't give me the time of day. Then ended up waiting for another few hours for some quick tests results before they decided it was worthwhile to give me an IV bag of prednisone before sending me home. Doctors are generally pretty good at figuring out whether or not someone needs priority care. In my case they've done a good job. Been to the ER multiple times.  
It took you four hours to be seen with chest pain? That’s insane.  
For real, that's something I'd call an ambulance for.

The US healthcare system is laughable... we here in South Korea can get tested for covid-19 within 10 minutes, for free, without the risks of waiting in an ER waiting room...  
Within 5 hours? That's terrifying. What is the ER like right now?  
I waited 7.5 hours for chest tightness and pain in Missouri a few weeks ago. I'm uninsured and got a $2500 bill for it. Whenever y'all want to burn this down and build something better from the ashes, I'm ready when you are.

I honestly have no idea. Could’ve been from work (we’ve had a few cases) despite me only going in once a week, or maybe from all the people I see cruising around Target and Food Lion without masks or improperly wearing them. The fact is that the compliance rate and enforcement is so low that the variables become impossible to track. Idk what would be a perfect solution, but the current state of affairs in the USA makes it hard to stay safe even if you do your job well.

I was hoping to hear that you went somewhere crowded or something crazy! But nope, you were just doing the bare minimum interaction to get through life. That doesn’t sound great. I’m working from home and just go to the grocery store. It’s awful.

It’s a pretty big counterpoint to deniers who seem to think the mask is a foolproof way to keep YOURSELF safe. Fact is, it stops everyone ELSE from getting to you. Can’t sneeze on you, can’t pick their nose and wipe it on a cereal box, whatever. Sorry, I really wish I was just a huge idiot who went to a big July 4th party instead of staying home and drinking mojitos. That would actually be better news than this.

The Spanish flu lasted 3 years! It sure would be nice if we could use all our new tech and knowledge to make this one much shorter. This has really revealed where our government has failed and how lacking education and critical thinking are these days.

Yes, I do this game in my head where when I hear that someone got sick I think that they must have went to a crowded church service or a bar or something. It is such a bummer to hear that someone "following the rules" still got sick.  I am sorry this happened to you and I hope you get better soon.

Ever have anxiety issues? I got something very covidy after Feb when my wife had to fly to Seattle for a conference and we live an hour out of NYC where it got hit hard and who knows where I got what I got but anxiety was all of my chest pain after the initial run of it. Killed my energy kept me bedridden and made me go get an EKG  to make sure it wasn't my heart after a doctor said my lungs sounded clear and I had left all other symptoms behind and still had the bad chest pain. Only thing I can think of is anxiety. Originally it was my lymph nodes everywhere and I lost all my strength and got bad muscle aches everywhere and had bad chills and headaches and fever and super low temperature of like 94 and spo2 levels of like 89-91 for a while and it all went away except for chest and arm pain and some fatigue. 4 months now I've been fighting it and I'm 90% sure what's left is just anxiety that made the initial fight with covid that much worse. My muscles get so tense and my chest gets so tight I literally have my sternum pop from the pressure. I didn't even know it could pop but I looked it up and sure enough. Not just that but neck and shoulders and everything gets stiff and pops like crazy constantly when I finish a bout of chest pains and anxiety attack.

I had the same symptoms for about 5 days (minus cough) and my doctor couldnt figure it out. Then a rash broke out on my side and it turned out to be SHINGLES from the stress of self-isolating so hard and worrying about keeping everyone safe. If you develop and little bumps or rashes around your trunk or neck go to the doctor IMMEDIATELY to start your antiviral treatment.

For me I thought it was little flea bites. We have a couch in the garage where the cats hang out and I took a nap out there. When I woke up I had probably 8 or 9 little raised, red bumps on my ribs on the side I had slept on. My dad looked it up, it was consistent with shingles, so we went to the doctor.

Hang in there! My 65yr-old father wants to literally travel across the world to come see his new grandkid right now, and I've been having an impossible time explaining to him that that's a terrible idea for so many reasons. We live in a tiny apartment, and there's no way I could actually see him quarantine himself properly upon arrival--and not to mention flights in and out aren't exactly plentiful. It's like, look, I know it sucks, we were planning on moving there anyway, but there's nothing any of us can do for now, and doing nothing is actually the best way to ensure we'll all get to see each other... Then he starts going on about "I did things the right way, and I worked hard all my life to build my own little world" and all of this other unrelated stuff that has nothing to do with the state of the world. He's got high blood pressure and is asthmatic.  Family and friends, I love you, but we'll probably see each other next year or something. Sorry not sorry.

We were planning to go see our new grandson right when this began. We didn't go (different illness), but my daughter's in-laws went, and her MIL caught COVID-19 on the way back.  Fortunately, they were wearing masks, and being very careful because of the new baby.  She didn't get symptomatic until afterwards; no one else got sick. She's recovering, but it knocked her out.   I'm stir crazy, but this is not the year to go visiting.

It's a really rough time for new family additions. Our little one actually came at the height of the lockdown in our country, and we had to navigate checkpoints and figuring out a ride both to the hospital and back. And had to change hospitals essentially last-minute so I would even be allowed to be there for the labor. We kept it together, even if I wasn't in there for the delivery, but were just exhausted and broke down crying once we finally made it home. And neither of us live with our friends or family super nearby, so it's just been the three of us the entire time. Haven't even used the stroller or carseat (besides coming home from the hospital). You don't prepare for any of this. But you do the best you can. I'm still a bit furious with my cousin, who for some reason had my dad help drive their moving van down to Florida (where he then flew home from after staying for a week). He's ended up being okay, but it's like he's coping with everything using a bit of denial. And I want him to meet his grandchild, so he needs to actually remain healthy. How do you chastise a 65yr-old, though? Haha

I feel like its inevitable. OP did everything right and still got sick.  
It depends on your situation. OP said they have to go into work and they’re also shopping in stores where masks aren’t required. The easiest way to get it is indoors where people aren’t wearing masks and they’re doing that weekly. If you’re an essential worker or have to go indoors in a place that doesn’t have mask requirements, you can buy cloth masks with a filter pocket. None of its fool proof but it’s an added layer of protection if you live in an area where people aren’t taking it seriously.

Good on you for staying strong to your convictions it obviously paid off.    So, related. I feel like when i'm not paying attention I just feel a little short of breath. So it's making me pay attention so I breathe a little more often to keep up. I'm 60% sure it's because I read an article yesterday saying asymptomatic people have been popping up with lung conditions and that terrifies me and it's making my brain spin... But did you experience a feeling like that? I'm just sitting at home working but it's making me so anxious.

I'm 60% sure it's because I read an article yesterday saying asymptomatic people have been popping up with lung conditions and that terrifies me and it's making my brain spin... But did you experience a feeling like that? I'm just sitting at home working but it's making me so anxious.  
Be aware that anxiety can cause havoc with your breathing/heart rate/etc. This pandemic gave me my first ever real panic attack which was fun, couldn't catch my breath for a good 30 minutes.  
I had no COVID symptoms at all, I wore a mask, and I washed my hands. Within 5 hours of waking up today I was in the ER
Are you confirmed Corona diagnosed? Sounds like it could be something else.

Yeah I am an essential worker and I wear my mask all the time, I’m as concerned as anyone.  This does sound like something else. This sounds like something that works a lot faster.  I’m not throwing shade on OP. I hope they recover fast as hell and have no side effects. Best of luck, I just think jumping to conclusions within 5 hours can cause more worry than would be necessary if they waited till it’s been confirmed.

Exactly. This happened to me and it was a regular heart palpitation which caused immense anxiety.

I just experienced this 3 days ago. I was sitting on my bed and all of a sudden my heart started beating really fast and my body started sweating. Felt like I couldnt breath properly and my stomach felt weird. I immediatly started researching if it was a possible covid symptom which wss just making me feel even crazy (i almost felt like i was going to pass out). I instantly went outside and focused on my breathing and just told myself "you didnt catch anything everything is fine relax..." and my heart calmed down after a while. Never had this immense anxiety feeling before dont know what brough it on.

Agreed. There’s a lot going around right now!

I don’t want to sound insensitive but we shouldn’t attribute any illness to “omg I got the COVID and you will too!” This is what makes reddit so unhealthy to read. Based on what op said about the warzone in the stomach methinks s/he contracted gastroenteritis (stomach flu) more likely than COVID.

Nausea, vomiting & diarrhea are on the CDCs list of major covid symptoms.

Covid causes stomach problems in tons of people. It's a really common symptom. You're not taking this seriously enough.

I had COVID and my symptoms came on very suddenly too, so did my partner's. We were fine, then started feeling kind of crummy, and within an hour or two my partner was coughing so hard he threw up and I was hacking up a lung and having asthma attacks.

Wait did I miss something? Did you test positive for it because I don't see that in your post.  
No. If you read the entire post, you can see that they cleverly only mention the fact that they had no covid symptoms. They never make the claim that they had it. After an edit, they even make the point that they didn't even wait until they were tested before making the post. This could be someone with the stomach flu. This was just someone who really wanted attention and ended up on the front page of Reddit. The wonders of throwing the word covid into the title of a post...  
Wait did I miss something? Did you test positive for it because I don't see that in your post.  
I was thinking the same thing. There’s plenty of other illnesses that still very much exist.

He didn't say it's COVID, he just said he has the symptoms and remarks how important social distancing is, -in case- it actually is COVID. That's what I understood

That’s how it felt to me, I was unable to take complete breaths, and body was in pain, lasted 3 days before I said fuck it and had my pops drive me to the hospital, thought I had a flu cuz I was phlegmy, wasn’t listed as a symptom online as far as I could see. Turned out I was covid positive. Was in the hospital for about a week they had me on oxygen. Just chilling in my room breathing in pure oxygen watching Cartoon Network. I forgot how annoying commercials are.

I wonder if that is Norovirus? Sounds similar to an experience I had with Norovirus, that thing came so fast out of nowhere, within hours of exposure on a flight a few years back, was in the ER about 4-5 hours after my flight with severe dehydration, they couldn’t really do much so they sent me home. That was a fun 2/3 days after that.

Thanks for sharing, I'm so sorry you're going through this.... As an aside, because as much as I emphasize responsibility in my daily life, I also don't like it when fear based in misinformation is unintentionally spread: Please let us know if it's actually COVID-related...I read the update where you mention that despite following CDC guidelines you contracted something, and while that's absolutely possible, I have a hunch based on what you've said (that you've followed CDC guidelines and that your mom happens to be immunocompromised) that it's more likely that you developed something instead of contracting something. That is, your doctor's might want to check for some sort of autoimmune disorder. Which would really suck, so I hope maybe you just caught a bad case of the flu :/. Wishing you the best.

 “act in such a way that if everyone did so, everything would work out”.  i absolutely love this, and i wish everyone had a similar mindset.  I hope you feel better soon, and that its not Covid, as the effects can be long lasting and devistating. Thank you for trying to be responsible, as shitty as it is to have to isolate yourself.

I feel your pain. I hope you heal quickly and have no lasting affects. I was in the ER this morning with a scare. I went to bed last night, woke up coughing, chills, headache. I started freaking out and made myself hyperventilate @ 7 am which made me and my husband think, I have it. Was @ the ER by 7:17 We live close because I worked in EMS for 13 years until I was injured a couple years ago. I was tested and they ended up treating me for an acute migraine. I used to get them all the time, every other day. But when we moved closer to where I used to work, they stopped. I hadn't had one in 9 months. I am back at home but I am scared . We just got an Emergency Alert on our phones saying Franklin Co is having an alarming rate of positive tests and to wear the mask that has been mandated or stay home. Again, feel better, and I am so sorry that you have to go through this.

I hope everything goes well for you and all of the other people that have/might have the virus. I kinda feel sorry for all of those anti-mask people out there cause they have way higher probabilities of infection all because they were very misinformed

That sounds a lot like norovirus.  It spread into a global pandemic in 1968 and has been killing around 200,000 people a year. It is responsible for about half of all food-borne illnesses in the US, and it can spread without close contact to another human, usually through food. Alcohol doesn't easily kill it, so it is extremely important to wash your hands, and not just use hand sanitizer. Also, wash your produce, even if it's pre-washed, and bag it a produce bag, before putting it in a reusable bag, or if you can, avoid putting food in reusable bags, altogether.

Thank you for being so careful these last few months, and I'm so sorry you got sick as a "reward".

I sincerely hope you get well soon.

You haven't even tested positive, it could be anything. High blood pressure. Flu. Ate something bad. A plethora of different heart and respiratory diseases/syndromes. There are literally thousand if not tens of thousands of causes for your symptoms. Also, the onset time and symptoms don't really point towards covid I hope you get better but I kind of feel you jumped the gun with this post.

Woah that’s crazy. I’m really trying to take care of myself for my grandma and my baby sister but it’s hard since I work two jobs. Every little thing I feel such as a headache, or a pain I immediately think I have COVID. Thinking of getting tested soon, you never know. Everyone please take care of yourselves! Wear your masks, wash your hands, and social distance! We can do this!

I hope you feel well soon. Also ask for a flu test if you can as well, there is something a little unusual about how quickly and hard your symptoms struck. Covid doesn’t typically do that. Hope this helps :)

Just wanna add wearing a mask does NOT protect you. It stops you from spreading your germs. So if you go to a place and no one is wearing a mask the gtfo. Youre being courteous and trying to protect others incase you've been exposed and theyre basically giving you the middle finger. Treat them like they have the plauge, shame them, shits unacceptable at this point

Hang in there OP. As someone who had it back in April, it's not fun, and you're gonna feel like shit for a while, but you're going to get through it. Have you lost your smell and/or taste yet? That was probably the most shocking part for me. Keep your head up and feel free to reach out if you ever need to talk to someone who has been through it!

Right there with you. I went and got tested on Sunday, did not go to the ER. Been careful about not going out, only going to work 2 days a week and home, wearing a mask. I go fishing and take walks in the woods by myself. My roommate met a new girlfriend over lockdown and has done the polar opposite. I have pre existing conditions. She does not.  Nurse listened to my lungs in the parking lot when she gave me the swab and said to come back for xrays. Based off symptoms if its not covid it very well could be pneumonia. Had it twice before, feels like it. Ive been fighting a cough since early January. Now I'm much worse cough, exhausted, cant catch my breath after going up a staircase or after a few sentences, night sweats and hot flashes. Temp hasnt broken 100.4. They want to wait for results before I go back.  Good luck to you. I have a feeling that by the end a lot of us who are doing right thing are still going to get screwed by the selfish few.

Yeah I’ve had respiratory failure before. No joke. I was eating ibuprofen to make it through the day. Then I had an asthma attack. My body temp was 104.5 when I could walk. Literally thought I was going to die. My mom who’s a nurse couldn’t even hold my hand before I passed out. I made my peace with God and life as my vision went before passing out. 3 nights in the hospital.  I also know of a 12 year old girl who got Covid and then got bells paulsy. This is scary. It’s not the flu.  I hope you get through this. Stay strong.  
I had no COVID symptoms at all, I wore a mask, and I washed my hands. Within 5 hours of waking up today I was in the ER
Hey OP. First off, yes to everything you said. But before you start self-diagnosing, it very well may not be the virus. I had those exact symptoms and almost in the same time span when I had a potassium deficiency (doctors couldn't really pin it to anything, just that I severely lacked potassium. This was also a few years ago, well before covid). So wait for the results before you drive yourself nuts  
I had no COVID symptoms at all, I wore a mask, and I washed my hands. Within 5 hours of waking up today I was in the ER
I’m an ER nurse working in Texas. My patients have been telling me how much they’ve been following guidelines and still getting ill. They most likely contract it from family or other individuals that bring it home. Most of them go home. Some get admitted and even smaller portion are getting intubated with respiratory failure and kidney failure. Most will survive. Some will die. We don’t get to choose who does what. Protect each other and stay safe.

I live in a Korean neighbourhood, so masks have always been a thing and for the reasons you mention.  I thought pre-pandemic that it might be a good idea to get some for traveling, especially in winter.. keep the face nice and warm, prevent spreading colds, etc.  But then I grew out my beard.. mask-beard is worse than hat-hair! lol  They'll probably be normal now, but I'd love to see some for people with big heads/faces and beards. Mine definitely don't look good.  That being said, it's a pandemic, so mask-beard really isn't all that bad.

An easy diy way to do it is to thread a bread tie or other thin guage wire in the nose. I use craft wire which is round and a bit thicker so it stays in position better.

I bought my husband some XL masks from Amazon. He's very happy with them. I also got some of the mask extenders for the back of his head and they've made a world of difference.  After this is over, I will wear a mask from now on if I have a cold, so as not to infect anyone else with my ick.

Saaaaame. I haven't spent a single cent on makeup since March. Loving it.  
I think I’ve worn makeup about 10 times total since the mask mandate... 5 of them were for telehealth appointments.  I used to be an every day, high coverage wearer. I’ve gone through pretty much every stage at this point, I think. Still wearing it even though it’s a waste. Happy to not be wearing it, almost liberated. Sad and missing it. Bargaining and only using eye makeup and a concealer. I’m trying to reach the acceptance part but it’s hard when you’re 34 and have been doing something routinely for 20 years.  I have a couple coworkers that still do full face. One because she has a decade of insecurity from cystic acne (she went on accutane and is all clear but still carries it with her) and the other says she is trying to maintain a sense of normalcy and I’m so conflicted on that.

Think of all the time (and don't forget money) spent doing your makeup and hair that you could spend sleeping, doing hobbies, spending time with loved ones, etc. It's ok to own your natural beauty contrary to what society tells women.

I totally agree and never did I ever think I’d be willing to go in public without makeup! I’m only doing tinted moisturizer and it’s pretty freeing. I do miss lipstick, but that’s not practical with mask wearing so cherry Chapstick it is! Oh, and I’m totally doing masks after all this. I’ve always been envious of the cultures where it’s been normal.  
The ugliest half of my face is covered. I consider that a win  
I have the resting bitch face, so apparently, covering my "annoyance" made me a little more approachable. But also the ugly part too

I like them to. But I was yesterday at the bank waring one and a hoody, nobady said anything, a year ago situation was very different.

Lmao ikr, whenever I stand outside a convenience store and put on a mask before walking in, I always feel like I'm prepping to rob the place

About four or  five months ago I had to stop to get gas, was inside the convenience store when I heard the door chime ring, looked up and saw three teens entering and pulling masks up over their face as they entered. I chuckled to myself because the relief came as they actually put the mask ON. I felt like we were officially living in “opposite world”.

I had the same feeling when a grocery store clerk complimented me on my mask. I said to her, "can you imagine saying that 6 months ago?" and we both laughed. Amazing how quickly "normal" can change.

East coast here: Wait til it’s winter here, all bundled up hood up, jacket on, mask on. It’s like the perfect robbery wardrobe. You’ll never know who’s going to steal and you’ll never know what they look like.

Yes, I was wearing a black hoodie with my black mask the other day and caught a glimpse of myself walking past a window, suddenly realised I looked like a bank robber or a mugger.

That remember me of the time I decided to shave my beard just to almost give myself a heart attack next morning when I don't recognize myself in the mirror. I did it to better fit a mask.

Major cultural differences is what I’d assume. America is individuality to the extreme, I can assume there’s a bigger sense of communal responsibility in Japan.

I live in San Francisco and started wearing N95s during fire season a few years ago. I mean, the air quality index was hitting 280+, the elderly were basically all told not to leave home, and people out and about were coughing violently. Why would I want that in my lungs, especially when it's not just trees and brush burning, but also plastic and manmade materials from all the houses that were torched? I'd wear the mask on my commute to work and people on the bus just stared, mouths agape. The reaction was so bizarre to me. At least SF adopted covid masks pretty well, at least in my neighborhood.

Ya, it's really laid bare how 40% of the country just doesn't give a fuck about anyone but themselves. And how they view any requirements from the government, no matter how common sense, as "tyranny" or some shit.

I started doing this a couple of years ago and got some weird looks at first, but when people heard me coughing they thanked me for it.  Since then I always have one or two masks in my work bag.  It's become a common courtesy at my company. That's around the time I started noticing them at doctors' offices and hospitals - a box of masks at the check-in counter along with a sign saying please wear one if you're coughing etc. It might eventually catch on here, but it would have taken a very long time.  After this, it might become much more common.

I also love wearing them. I have anxiety and I often pull my hoodie up over my chin/mouth or in winter cover my face with a scarf. I don’t like it when people stare on public transport and even if they aren’t, my anxiety makes me think they are. I can wear a mask and put my hoodie over my head and hide away under them. It’s perfect!

I feel you on the public transport. Pre-covid, not a week went by without some guy making a comment on my commute. Wearing a plain mask makes me so much more invisible and I've really enjoyed not having to manage random mens' feelings for my own safety. I will absolutely continue to mask up on public transportation for the rest of my life.

Here’s a trick I learned. Move your glasses just a little bit forward, and your glasses don’t fog up as much. When you keep them all the way back, they tend to fog up a lot, but not if you move them a little bit forward.

Okay, here's my glasses mask trick that isn't a trick but an actual mask hack.  I have this flexible aluminum wire that's used in sculpture called armature wire, it's super useful to have around because it's soft and flexible by hand but holds it's form.  Whatever masks I have, I'll cut a slit and feed some of that wire into the nose bridge, and then stitch it into place.  But I don't just do the nose bridge, I have the wire run from the cheek near the outer edge of my eye all the way to the other cheek, so the wire then moulds to my nose bridge and cheeks, sealing up that gap where your breath comes out and hits your glasses.  I'll post pics if anyone's interested.

I had the same problem, but learned that washing the lenses with soapy water and letting them airdry prevents fogginess. It's a pain to remember everytime I go out, but it only takes a few minutes.

I wonder though about laws. Some states or counties in the US have laws against wearing masks unless you are doing a job that requires them. I suppose public or personal health may override, but I'm not sure.

New York was one of those places. The law was from 1879 (IIRC) and it was exclusively used as a tool of oppression. Luckily, in a rare moment of sanity, the Legislature repealed the law in March.

Is ended up making my own masks so I just put two pieces of pipe cleaner craft wire into the nose piece so the mask molds tight against my face. Assuming your masks have at least 2 layers and you have the ability to use a needle, it's pretty easy to add your own.  I've also seen some mask inserts online that help direct the air down.

I had the flu in January and wore a mask to the pharmacy. Everyone looked at me weird but if only I could see them now and look at them weird with their masks!! Crazy because I remember googling coronavirus in my state at the time, but it didn’t really become nationwide until March or so. I’d never had the flu before and it was horrible. Only lasted a day and a half though.

Yes, if the socially responsible decide to continue to wear masks we could make it mainstream. There will always be people that refuse but they're the same ones that do now. I've already decided that when it's safe and I have the capital to start my own business, optional mask usage will be written in to the uniform policy. The biggest issue I know a lot of retail businesses faced at the start of the pandemic was "do we allow masks or don't we? It's never been brought up before."

This. It was never so blatantly obvious how many people are either hopelessly ignorant or selfish pricks before I had to see all the improperly worn masks in my city after our mask mandate began, and having to confront that fact day in and day out has been bumming me out pretty bad.

O don't dig the masks. I wear them because well duh. I can see them being great for severe allergies or " is this a cold?" So yea I like to think they will stick around for stuff bit i personally will be glad when they dont need to be a daily thing.

I have mild allergy that can be triggered by some perfumes and small particles like dust, going outside and doing everything with a mask has been really helpful, I haven't had a single allergic  reaction in 7 months, when I usually had one every couple of weeks.  Funnily enough I work in construction with cement flying all over the place but we've always used masks on site so that place has never been an issue

Hard same. I can't wait until we don't need to wear these anymore. I'll be especially thrilled when I don't need to wear one when working out. I've found a few that make it easy to breathe while exercising, but holy crap I'm so tired of my glasses fogging up.

Probably anecdotal but I haven't gotten sick since I started wearing a mask back in February. Usually I get a cold/Illnesses a few times a year. Been close to a year since I've felt under the weather. I think my last sickness was back in December/January.  Helped cut the allergies down too.

I think that would be a terrible idea. I’m hearing impaired and I need to lip read to understand what someone is saying. Masks cover that up completely.

Yeah that would suck. But I think if you're sick it would still be for the best. Plus if you're not you can pull it down !

I think that would be a terrible idea. I’m hearing impaired and I need to lip read to understand what someone is saying. Masks cover that up completely.  
I'm hearing impaired too! Idk. With masks I feel like we need to meet in the middle with fully hearing people. We can't demand that someone stops wearing a mask because it is inconvenient for us. I care about their health and try to keep an open mind that they could have an immunity issue, live with a sick loved one, etc. I'm fully speaking so I use Live Transcribe (or any transcription app) and ask them to speak into it if I'm having difficulty.  
I think that would be a terrible idea. I’m hearing impaired and I need to lip read to understand what someone is saying. Masks cover that up completely.  
That's the only reason I will take it off in front of someone. Had a hearing impaired customer come in yesterday and pointed directly to his aid, I just ripped the mask off. Small benefits of working customer service for a decade is recognizing accessibility concerns when they come up...

Is it ok that I don't like them? I mean, it's not a big deal to me to wear one, I really feel for people working in retail who have to deal with those that actively sabotage the idea of stopping spread by not wearing them, or having their nose stick out. I actually feel more self conscious with a mask. I have a harder time recognizing people (already difficult for me) I can't smile at anyone, and the good ones are another expensive accessory and I have a hard enough time affording all the other necessary things for life. I have a few cheapo ones and I am glad to take them off whenever I get out of a public space. It definitely seems like a good idea to wear when sick, or on cold days (as long as the dampness doesn't interfere - that clammy air seems like a good spot for random bacteria). I'm glad they help with anxiety for some. But I am looking forward to not wearing them as much anyway, and not worrying when I forget mine.

Nothing wrong with not liking wearing it.  I strongly dislike wearing mine, but I do when/where required out of respect for those around me.  But, as soon as possible, I take the damned thing off.  It's probably just all in my head, but I get short of breath with mine on, and it makes my beard kind of itchy.

Masks are miserable. In hot weather I can only tolerate them for like 20 seconds, have no clue what's up with everyone else. Medical masks are the most comfortable but they still sukkk.  
Is it ok that I don't like them? I mean, it's not a big deal to me to wear one, I really feel for people working in retail who have to deal with those that actively sabotage the idea of stopping spread by not wearing them, or having their nose stick out. I actually feel more self conscious with a mask. I have a harder time recognizing people (already difficult for me) I can't smile at anyone, and the good ones are another expensive accessory and I have a hard enough time affording all the other necessary things for life. I have a few cheapo ones and I am glad to take them off whenever I get out of a public space. It definitely seems like a good idea to wear when sick, or on cold days (as long as the dampness doesn't interfere - that clammy air seems like a good spot for random bacteria). I'm glad they help with anxiety for some. But I am looking forward to not wearing them as much anyway, and not worrying when I forget mine.  
I wear mine out all the time too and I I've really come to hate it. I've never said "what?" so many times in my life before. I'm tired of always being muffled and everyone trying to say something in public being muffled to where we can't even hear each other (and no, I'm saying the alternative of spreading covid is better). The staff at the gym and myself don't even say hi anymore. Everyone feels much more isolated  since we're missing such a significant set of social cues.

I work in healthcare, and it’s been really difficult with elderly or hearing impaired patients. We do it because it’s necessary, but I’m looking forward to it going back to being a sometimes thing.

I'm glad I can project my voice well, but when I'm at work (cashiering), it's always frustrating when I get quiet customers, because I can't tell anymore if they answered a question I had for them. Their mouth moving is the only way I might have to tell what their answer is, and with COVID, I only have more questions to ask. And that's just the least problematic of not seeing mouths and noses as a social species.

Thank you. I see a lot of posts like this on reddit with people saying they love them, and I obviously don't get out much. The normalization of a lot of aspects of lockdown irks me. I realize for some people it's been great, but not for everyone. It has kind of amplified the gap between the privileged and non privileged.

That's perfectly ok :) I know a few people with adhd who say the mask is a bad sensory experience for them so they dont like them. I understand about the not recognizing people too

They're not even sticking around FOR corona. I used to think it was weird to see people from Asia (sorry for my ignorance) wearing masks all the time. After Covid, I'll never think that again. Even if I choose to not wear a mask, I'll think "that person is being cautious. Good on them."

I have little cotton pads that I put over the nose part of the mask with double stick tape and switch every time I go outside. It’s been the best solution for me so far and really has helped breakouts since that’s the biggest point of contact.

I'm very much pro-mask for covid prevention BUT I honestly cannot wait until it's safe to put them in the garbage forever.  I live in a tropical climate and it's miserable to not be able to feel a cool breeze on your face when it's 90% humidity. Plus I'm prone to migraines and I've had more this year than in the past and I have a feeling they're stemming from either pressure on the ears from the loops or the slight pressure on the bridge of my nose.

Yesss! And I don’t want anyone sick coughing on me. We all learned how to cover our mouths when we were 5, but some people still want to be inconsiderate trash pandas. I wish everyone would wear a mask when they are sick.

Yeah exactly. That's why I take issue when people say it's their right to not wear a mask and it's not anyone's business. Like yeah I guess, but it does make you selfish if you know or think you're sick. So it is other people's business in that way.

I was leaving the grocery store the other day, and as I was walking out the door an older man PULLED HIS MASK DOWN in the lobby and started hacking all over the place. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I've never been so grateful to be wearing a mask.

I am autistic and always told I am making the wrong facial expressions but masks have been amazing for me! They are uncomfortable when it’s hot but as long as I have a comfortable mask then I am happier and more comfortable and confident than ever before. It’s so much easier to interact with people without having to worry about making the “right” facial expressions and it’s not as overwhelming to look at people’s faces now too. I lived in Asia for almost 4 years and it was one thing that I always wished we had in the west and I’m hoping it sticks around post-COVID too.

I'll stop wearing masks as soon as it stops being mandatory. My face gets sweaty in them. And I love wearing bright lipstick, now it's sadly useless.

I don't think anyone will wear a mask 24/7 (although if they choose to that's their right). I think it should be more of a social courtesy to wear one out in public if you're sick. I've also encountered several guests with terrible allergies that said this was the best allergy season for them because the mask filtered out a lot of the pollen.  
I hope masks stick around after Corona
I honestly hate wearing masks. I have anxiety so going into it I'd assumed that I would've liked wearing one but I really don't, it makes my face warm  and is all round an uncomfortable experience so I don't really get where you're coming from but if it makes you happy then go ahead  
I hope masks stick around after Corona
I love the masks. This is the first year my seasonal allergies hasn’t flared up and I’ve used less makeup since I’m covered anyways. I also feel less “icky”when I’m out and hear people coughing or sneezing.

Same here, that’s been a huge benefit. I haven’t been sick since February and I used to get a mild cold every month or two.  If you can mask up in the office on those days when you are feeling a little off but not bad enough to take a sick day, it’s going to make such a difference

As a germaphobe with slight OCD and a 5 year old that gets hospitalized every time he gets the stomach flu (which spoiler alert: kids get all the freakin time) I have PTSD from the first time he was hospitalized for it and it sends me spiraling down a in a panic attack every time - all while trying to comfort him as he obviously hates it and is in a lot of pain and confused because he’s so young. I have a wanted to wear masks/gloves since forever and I’m finally happy to be able to do it lol! I’ll continue as long as I can, hoping to until he is older and doesn’t get sick as much! Also hoping people continue to wash their hands and stay home when sick too. Jesus, it’s embarrassing that it took a global pandemic to make this an obvious habit...  
I hope masks stick around after Corona
Went from always using the snapchat mask filters to just always wearing a mask.  I make my own fabric masks and my SO and I have a lot of fun with it. We match them to our outfits, we look for interesting fabrics when we run to the store for groceries and since elastic was hard to get I found a pattern that allows for one long ribbon to loop through and can be tied the in back. It’s been nice since I work a healthcare job with 16 hour shifts and originally I was getting blisters from the flat elastic. Now I just crochet yarn straps and he helps me match the colors. It’s sweet in its own ‘weird things we do in 2020’ kind of way.  Just recently we were sorting through my spare room and found a lot of fabric buried in a bin in the closet and he kept telling me which ones he liked for masks. While I’ve probably made about 25 for us, family and coworkers I’ve been hesitant to make a ton of them because, for whatever reason, I thought this would be over by now (silly optimism) and didn’t want to waste resources.  It’s still sinking in that we’re in for at least another 6 months so I may just start getting weird/having fun with new styles and embellishments and carry the thought that, hey, they’re keeping us healthy and I’ll probably get a lot of use from them since I plan on continuing to use them after the pandemic is over.  
I hope masks stick around after Corona
I hope for the same thing too. The masks help with my anxiety. Half of my face is covered so people can only see half of my ugly face, lol. But really, those masks help me go in public and shop for groceries because people will not care about how I look. I get allergies easily too, so it prevents that. Plus the masks have become somewhat of a fashion item, so I bought a couple of plain and printed ones from puraka masks and etsy. It's a good investment too, since it is obvious that this pandemic ain't going anywhere yet.  
I hope masks stick around after Corona
I’m sure it will. At least it will be more common to wear it now. Also I usually get a cold about 2 or 3 times a year. I haven’t gotten sick at all this year. I believe the masks helped with that. For now on (including after the coronavirus goes away, hopefully) if I have any kind of ill symptoms I’m going to wear a mask to prevent other people from getting sick.

I work in a supermarket (in Belgium) and we've been forced to wear masks for a few months now. Before we were forced we were allowed to choose whether or not to wear masks. Myself and a handful of employees appreciated the thought and immediately started wearing masks. Because of this, and various other precautionary measures, none of us have gotten infected through the whole pandemic. Wearing a mask for up to ten hours a day, lifting heaving boxes, walking kilometers and talking to clients is exhausting and I look forward to taking the thing off at the end of the day. We've gotten used to it but my view on it compared to the beginning has definitely changed. As soon as there is no reason to wear it anymore I'll be glad to be rid of it. However, I will never I my life NOT thank someone for wearing a mask again. The fact that people wear masks doesn't just mean they care about themselves, it means they care about others. In short I agree with OP. Masks should become the norm in the West as it has been in the East.

Me too. I remember telling people for years that I wish it was socially acceptable to wear masks in public. Then when the pandemic happened I went “wait, no, not like this”.  If anything good comes out of it, let it be the normalcy of masks.

I have a chronic cough that's not related to any contagious situation.  I had bought a small pack of masks in January because I was thinking of just wearing them on my commute, so I didn't have to worry about covering my mouth when I cough (since one hand was holding my phone and the other the subway strap), or about coughs escaping around an elbow, etc.    (I used to cough into my jacket neck, but I had someone yell at me for not covering my cough. ?!? And warm weather would come and I might not have a jacket neck to use)   But I hesitated to wear them because I didn't know how people would react--that they'd think I was contagious and tell me I should stay home anyway.  Now I'm just going to wear a mask everywhere I go.

I don't go anywhere now! Partly because of that, to be honest. The times I've had to go to the doctor, or make a stop in the store, I am really nervous about the cough thing. I mean, I have a really good mask, so I really shouldn't be spewing germs everywhere when I cough. But it still makes me nervous about people's reactions.  I'm fortunate that I started a treatment regimen last year that has cut it WAY down, but it's not gone. It'll never be gone.

Mask culture is strong in Asia, people wear it whenever they came up with a flu or something. Mostly because of SARS.  So it's a bit puzzling why the US/EU struggle with having a mask on just to not be sick. I remember wearing a mask to school waaaaay before Covid cuz I had a bad cold, been told to take off my mask so I don't scare the classmates. iirc I got someone sitting next to me in class sick. (oops) ​ My friends in Asia wear a mask when they don't want to talk to people, so they can pretend to be sick lol I wear it sometimes for that purpose too.

I love them. Not just me wearing them but other people. I’m autistic and I’ve found it much easier to talk to people when they are wearing a mask. It’s like it makes their faces less intense or something. For me, wearing one also reduces my anxiety because I don’t have to worry about what my face is doing. Sometimes my expressions don’t match what I’m really thinking/feeling which causes social difficulties. Masks solve all this, as well as helping prevent disease spread. Not just Covid. I don’t want to catch anything, even a cold.

Even if it stops you can definitely continue wearing it and no one will blame you. This is common in Asian countries due to the excessive pollution but it should be a normal way of life. Wearing masks prevent many other diseases besides coronavirus. Many viruses like the flu can be stopped partially by wearing masks.

My wife lasted 13 years with me before she farted in front of me. Aparently she had done it before but blamed the dog. The day it actually happened, it was supposed to be "silent yet deadly" but was actually "LOUD AS FUCK". Have you seen that reaction gif of Chris pratt with the :O face? That was me for about 3 days afterwards.  
Manages to not fart for 24 years...husband posts it online for the one time you did.  
And 14 hours after it happened nearly 20,000 people know about it.  
My wife does that too. I call them her "night whispers." We laugh about it, it's all in good fun.  
Dying at night whispers, thanks for that good laugh lol

It always reminds me of a Family Guy bit when Peter was blowing raspberries whenever Chris mentions Meg's name because he was mad at her; then Chris whispered it so Peter did a soft one.

Girlfriend never farts, claims she doesn't fart, is disgusted at the notion that she is even capable of farting. I told her she rips mad ass in her sleep and she called me a psycho.  I downloaded one of those sleep recording apps and set it on while i went to work late one night, went to sleep around 3am and stopped the app.  Showed her the 13 loud boisterous farts in the morning and of course she thinks I came and ripped ass on my own phone.  
i lost it at “rips mad ass” and now i can’t stop laughing

My wife of almost 8 years was the same way but is finally letting her guard down when she's not asleep. In her sleep, she normally lets em rip unknowingly. They wake me up and I just stare wide-eyed into the darkness with a stupid grin, trying not to laugh (or breathe). Now, when she lets one slip when walking around the house, I will make a comment about crop dusting or dropping some ass, making her giggle. The rest come out in little expedited prrts because she's trying to move quickly to the bathroom as I keep staying stupid shit to make her laugh harder. The best ones are when she pees herself from laughing. I love that woman.

I refuse to believe that she actually thinks that but I applaud your commitment  
My wife of 9 years will feel one coming up, stand in the middle of the room and shake her ass as she farts as in order to create a percussive slapping sound. I love that woman.  
It’s all fun and games ‘til someone poops themselves.

When my wife and I were dating, I helped embarrass the hell out of her on accident.  I was dreaming about bugs around me, and she was very close to me (full size bed at the time).  She farted in her sleep while her butt was touching my leg.  Of course mixed with my bug dream, I thought a bug had got me and I woke up and freaked out like one had.  My heart was racing and she was mortified.  We laugh about it now.  And she also only farts in her sleep.  I tend to not purposely fart audibly in front of her as well.  Not sure why.  Maybe to keep some mystique, I don’t know.  
The mystique of the sound of your farts 😂  
She whispered in her panties.  
Cough in her knickers

OH MY GOD LMAO  
I always have this fear when a new guy sleeps over. Especially if I’ve been trying to hold it in most of the night.  I know I must fart in my sleep. I’m terrified  
In my head if it's all held in until bedtime... my fear is, it's gonna sound like there's a sousaphone battle raging under the sheet. Blanket will be flapping in the wind, boyfriend will have to hold onto the bedframe like he's Carol Anne from Poltergeist. It's like a valve under pressure, gotta let some steam out to avoid a catastrophe later. We all play the devil's tuba, there is at least comfort in that.  
When I was in college in the 90s I was dating a girl for a few weeks before we had our first all night shag session. The next morning she was sitting on my chest and let a whopper rip, it was LOUD.  She's taking a bath now and should come to bed in a few.  
Nothing like post coitus lady front funk and arse gas mixed to wake ya up in the mornin’.  
OMG. 😂😂😂😂😂  Us ashamed of farts must be missing out. Thank you everyone who is NOT as hard on us as we are on ourselves. Its honestly devastating to think one (or more) got away...in front of a significant other.  
One time I forgot to flush after pooping at my at-the-time GF’s place. She mentioned it in passing and I almost threw up from embarrassment.

I did this once when I was having a horrible morning. I wore two different shoes to work, was late. My husband came home at lunch and texted me “you pooped and didn’t flush. What the hell kinda day are you having?” And we laughed about it. I was embarrassed but so defeated by the day at that point that I just accepted my fate as a nasty swamp wife 🤷‍♀️

Not in a relationship, but I would assume at some point that you accept someone else for everything they have and everything they are. I mean what is the point of for better or worse if their worse doesn't include the little things that might drive you crazy. If that means waking up every morning to someone who drops bass after tacos, then so be it.  
My wife of 24 years just farted in front of me for the first time ever.
The first time I farted in front of my now-husband was when we were getting frisky. We were in the middle of...stuff...and he kind of squeezed one out of me. I was so embarrassed. My husband, bless him, looked at me and was like “that’s it? That’s nothing. That wouldn’t even singe the hair on a dog.” And we went back to our business. We still laugh about it and we’ve been together for 15 years.

My husband farted the first day we met. He was at my uncle's house and he needed to use the bathroom really bad. My uncle was taking for ever and he accidentally farted and said sorry. In his culture, it's really rude and disrespectful to fart in front of someone, even your own siblings or parents, so it was a funny moment where he let go of all those ideas and had to fart. Edit: he didn't fart in me. Not sure what happened there.

I took my dog to the vet once because she hadn't been pooping.  They gave her barium to make things move around in there, and the fart she released was so toxic the vet left the room with her nose plugged.

Those are rough. I work at a hospital and one of the patients called us because his bag was standing erect, absolutely filled with gas to the point that it was taught and we didnt want to lose the bag or put our guy in any unnecessary discomfort. After we drew straws one giy went in to go "burp" it and let the gas out and it was so foul that he had to go sit in the breakroom because the smell just clung to his clothes

And then there's my house where my husband of 27 years and my 2 adult sons will hold in a fart until they can get near one another so they can fart in/near someone's face. I would love some more manners.

How do I get scarier? Teach me your ways!  
How do I get scarier? Teach me your ways!  
I learned from watching my mom and grandma, and perfected it while teaching middle school.   It is a combination of a death glare and a properly intoned "I dare you". Yelling just gets their back up and they want to fight back. I get quiet. The quieter I speak, the madder I am. Questions like  "Want to rethink that?" or "Do  you really want to go there?" give them a chance to back down  without consequences.   If they don't backpedal quick, they aren't going to like the follow up. Follow up has included creative punishments  such as cleaning the bathroom for the kid with potty mouth (that was 14 years ago and he's still careful about his language around me) or soap on the wall where one kept licking it. As adults,  I can get the desired results with just the look and quiet question most of the time.  When they were kids, I needed the follow up and always made it fit the offense.  They may outnumber me, but they are well aware that if I threaten them with something,  I will follow through. They aren't stupid and learned long ago that I have a long fuse, but it isn't going to end well for them if they light it. Even my husband only pushes just so hard.  That said, I will join in the goofiness and often start it,  but there is a firm line I won't let them cross. They disrespect me at their own risk. It  is my job to teach them what is and is not an acceptable way to treat a woman (or anyone  else) and what good manners are. I  refuse to let my future daughters in law deal with what I did when I married.  My husband is a good man, and I adore him, but his mother taught none of her 3 sons any sort of manners. My nephew in law says he loves me, but I scare him. First time he stayed with us, he took the last of the coffee before I had mine. The guys had him thinking I was going to kill him or something.  I  just patted his cheek and told him he is allowed one mistake, but don't do it again.  Now he won't get coffee unless he's sure I don't need a refill.  It  may be that I'm naturally scary. My guys all say I'm scary but that they adore me.  The trick is to keep your temper. That calm follow up is scarier than any amount of yelling or violence. Sometimes just a smile and quiet "Go ahead and keep it up " is enough. Make it an evil smile, though. It scares them more.

I had a first date at the movies last year and luckily we got there before anyone else was inside, and as soon as I sat down in the theater she stood back up while saying “excuse me I need to fart” and before I could comprehend the statement she’s stepping over the seats in front of us and trots to the other side of the theater, does a power squat between the row while gripping two seats.  She looked like she was about to launch into orbit and once she finished she sat back down next to me and I was completely bewildered as to how to feel.

Launch into orbit? Sounds like she was going to take a power shit. Didn’t anyone ever tell her don’t trust a fart? That could have ended badly.

Omg! I’ve had bubble guts from altitude and, being in the middle seat, having an airline blanket over your lap, trying to hold it in. But no, it comes out and my wife and I giggle like little kids in the middle of this stinky plane. We were like 35. 😁

Wait a minute. You two were dating for three months and you farted first? Maybe it because I'm a guy, but I doubt I could be around a group of tight-ass nuns for three days before I ripped one off.

My boyfriends mom is the exact same way and they are celebrating their 30th anniversary this year! We had a huge discussion about it and I was astonished at the possibility of this! She said she has never tooted in from of him! It’s hard to fathom. They must just not toot a lot because if it were me I’d have a stomach ache MOST days.

Almost to 32 years of marriage and my wife still hasn’t farted in front of me. All I ever get are the the night windies.

Honestly, until reddit I had no idea people were so gassy! I'm just...not. I don't think I've felt the need to fart this week. And I don't think I've ever intentionally farted in front of an SO (though I did in front of my ex once when camping, oops).

I wish my boyfriend were afraid to fart in front of me.   Oh dear LORD, I wish...

So, there's a card in the game Cards Against Humanity that just says "A gassy antelope."  Now, any time my husband or I have to fart we warn the other with references to the card, or talk about it in context of the card.  "An antelope is coming." "Antelopes are on their way." "Oh hey, a baby antelope."  "Herds of antelopes incoming, get to safety." "I have to antelope."  "I anteloped."

The "sorry" reminds me of my college roommate, us sitting on opposite sides of a small room. Him: [Suddenly smiling] Me: "What?" Him: "Sorry." Me: "Sorry ab--" [phalanx of farts reaches me] "You asshole." Him: "I said I was sorry."

The other day, my mom was telling me how my dad farted so loudly in his sleep that he woke himself up and woke her up in the morning. Any time I bring it up again, both of my parents break into laughter LOL

My wife has never farted near me. The cat and dog on the other hand fart all the time, but only when she’s around...

My not-yet-wife at the time farted on my thigh while asleep our first night together. First thought that crossed my mind was “Well, at this point we might as well get married.” being reminded of what a female subordinate at work had joked about “If you can fart in front of each other, you might as well be married.” That was six wonderful years ago.

My mom was the same way. My family didn't catch her farting until I was 22 or 23. We were having one of those rare nights where the whole family was together, watching a movie. There was no sound to the fart. Just the smell. It started wafting up and filling the room. My siblings and I immediately started blaming our dad. Guy's farts are honestly the stuff of legend. But he insisted it wasn't him. And this one, man, it was worse than anything he'd done in years. So then we're blaming each other, we're blaming the dog, we're blaming the other dog, we're blaming my cat. I was told to check the litter box, but nothing in there. But the smell's not going away. It's hovering, filling the room, it's hard to breathe. So finally, my dad loses patience. He decides one of the dogs must have shit in the living room. He turns on the lights, and we see my mom is beat beet red. This ungodly the fart - the epitome of silent but deadly - had come from my mom. We were stunned. We had never caught her farting before. Her and my dad had been dating since I was three and married since I was nine. He had never even heard her fart in her sleep. My world was changed that day. Anyway, she got stomach reduction surgery a few years ago and farts all the time now and stopped going to the bathroom to do when she's at home (which, yeah, makes sense) and it's fucking awful. Edit: An important word.

Reminded me of Robin Williams' story in Good Will Hunting about his wife farting in her sleep.

I farted silently in a closet today while my wife was right next to me.  I kept waiting for the hammer to drop because it stank terribly, but she never mentioned it. Now I feel like she's got the corona and we're all gonna die.

I am amazed that your wife never farted in front of you through FOUR pregnancies. Pregnancy turned me into a walking biohazard from week six onward. My husband and I were never shy about farting in front of each other, but lately I’ve considered leaving the room to let one rip because, as he proclaims and I agree, the recent escalation in frequency, volume, and odor is a human rights violation.

Oh my lord. I can't imagine being with my husband 24 years before farting around him. To be honest though, I was like you wife when I met him we've been together 3 years. One day, about a year and a half ago, was the day that changed EVERYTHING. We hadnt seen each other for a while and were super happy to be together again.  I told him I had to go to the bathroom, and I stood up and went to the bathroom. That's how I remember it. But as he recalls, I stood up telling him "I have to pee" and went to the bathroom and shut the door. But I never shut the door when peeing (which he had noticed about me after being together a while) so me closing the door was a telltale sign for him. So for whatever reason, he decided to just... Walk in and start talking to me about some post on Facebook he saw. And i, turd halfway out of my butthole, deer in the headlights look on my face, turned bright red and told him to leave. He asked me why. I was too embarrassed to tell him I was pooping and I was prairie doggin it as we spoke. I ended up bursting into uncontrollable nervous laughter and farting at the same time followed by the huge log plopping loudly into the toilet, which crossed some kind of line in our relation ship and now we both fart around the other and shit with the door open. That's the story of how my husband and I lost our shame.

I remember when my wife first farted in front of me. I made a huge deal about it on MySpace. You say you got four kids, so that kinda ruins what I was gonna say. I was gonna say, spend any amount of time with a little girl and you'll soon forget about "things girls don't do." Everything I've heard that boys do — like burp/fart and laugh about it, play in the mud, fight — girls do, too. It's like people in the Midwest who think they're the only ones who say 'ope' — nope. But hey, that's awesome, and congrats on 24 years. Coming up on 14 years myself.

My oldest son when he was six heard his mama fart for the first time. He looked at me in astonishment and said “Mama’s don’t fart”

That is too cute, I love it. I went 21 years having never farted in front of anyone, not even my family, least of all a romantic partner. The very first time was while straddling my boyfriend and making out. I was SO MORTIFIED but he found it hilarious and clamped his arms down around me so I couldn't get away. That was ten years ago, and I now fart around him every day and will never stop. The best moment was farting in front of my brothers, who FLIPPED and told our parents, who refused to believe them because "vanvarmar would NEVER do that!"

I never understood married people who don't fart in front of each other or can't be in the bathroom at the same time while one is on the toilet. ​ Like, if you can have sex with someone, everything else should be no big deal. ​ EDIT: I am flabbergasted by all of these responses. I just can't understand how you can be married to someone, this is your partner, your best friend, your spouse, that you have BEEN INSIDE OF, but the idea of seeing them on the toilet is 'gross', is just beyond me. Especially people with kids! I just can't understand it one bit.

We all have our limits. I like my privacy in the bathroom too, but my wife is private about everything that relates to bodily functions. She gets grossed out easily and she had a very strict ''act like a lady'' upbringing, so it's understandable.

How did pregnancy/labor go with 4 kids?  
How did pregnancy/labor go with 4 kids?  
Our son is adopted, so there were only 3 pregnancies. Our first daughter, I wasn't allowed in the delivery room because it was against hospital policy. Our second daughter, she went into premature labor and I was away on a business trip, and we even switched hospitals so I could be allowed in the delivery room but unfortunately I wasn't even in town. Our third daughter, she was rushed to an emergency c-section and I wasn't allowed in because it was a high risk procedure. So I never got the opportunity to be in the delivery room with her. As far as pregnancies go, she never farted or pooped in front of me, but I do remember her telling me that she had to pee more often. She does talk about her period sometimes, especially now as she approaches menopause so I think we're making progress. Maybe she'll even admit that she poops before I die.  
How did pregnancy/labor go with 4 kids?  
I was wondering how you could do 8-9 month pregnancy without farting freely in your own home!

Farting is fair game but we don’t poop or piss in front of each other. Different people have different limits.

Any semblance of privacy went out the window between me and my husband when he helped me keep my pubic hair under control while I was pregnant. It was ridiculously intimate with zero sexual capacity, it was really strange.

After 8 years I’d like the farting, burping and pooping near me to stop honestly. Or at least incorporate other actions other than those.

100% agree. Not only because you’re having sex but because your spouse should be the one person who you don’t have to be guarded around. And you should be comfortable enough to do whatever you want in your own home. I can’t imagine going through life always holding in farts or having to leave the room to burp in my own home because I don’t want to be ‘embarrassed’ in front if my spouse. Home is the one place where you should be able to fart, burp, poop and do wherever else you want completely freely.

Same with my dad. My grandma would hold him down and fart on him as a child so I think it comes from that trauma.

I genuinely thought that it would never happen with my wife. She says it happened today and never again lol, I have to say I'm impressed that she broke the 24 year old habit of excusing herself and leaving the room to fart

All four of us (mum, dad, brother, me) are living in the same house for the first time in a while.  My personal favourite is when someone is sat in the middle and everyone around them farts. They Cannae escape the gas.

Aaaahhh! Congratulations dude!! So happy to hear you're alive and cuddling with your cat!! Several years ago I was really suicidal too.

Sending you and your kitty positive vibes and well wishes! Hope your recovery continues to go smoothly! What kind of cake are you baking?

I also struggle daily so I just keep getting more cats lol. Three right now and plan to adopt a kitten in a few months, my oldest is getting up there. Gotta be needed, no one loves me like they do and no one would love them like I do and they deserve the very best.

That's right. Map out your life in baked goods. I pretty much credit curries and pickles for saving me a few months ago. Pretty much got through each day just on the strength of the next recipe I had to plan and make. Going through another rough patch now so I am knitting for my life.

I had rats in my dorm in college (as pets). They were such baller friends. Sometimes one would sit on my shoulder while I worked on my laptop and when I would give them pringles to eat it looked like they were holding up big posterboards. RIP Eugene, Shelby, Penny, Coral, and Jenny.

Fuck man, that is not casual, but thanks for reaching out. My brother attempted last year. Luckily he called a hotline before & they found him in time. He's staying @ mom & dads now depressed, not looking for work, ect. ect. I live a tough life, & I think lots of us do. What is your advise; how or what can we do to help a friend/family member/ or just a fellow redditor/human that feels like this is the answer?

I’m sorry to hear someone you love is going through similar stuff. To be honest, I would have done better if I had someone I love/who loves me close by, but I live alone in the city. Call them often, text them often, not about what they’re going through but about everyday stuff. My friend and I exchange memes, which works pretty well. Telling them how much they mean to you and how much you love them along with a long hard hug can do wonders.

Can they afford ketamine treatments? I have a SERIOUSLY depressed friend (with severe anhedonia since childhood) who has tried everything. She, too, has made attempts/plans to end it all. Her last stop was ketamine, and the doc told her if after 3 treatments she didn’t feel improvement that she would be considered a non-responder and to quit. Well lo and behold after 3 treatments she felt nothing. Something told her to press on and she sent me a message last night saying on treatment 5 she felt a lightness she hadn’t felt in many years. I can’t describe to you the feeling I felt hearing that, but suffice to say it was a lightness I hadn’t felt in years.

He's staying @ mom & dads now depressed, not looking for work, ect. ect. I live a tough life, & I think lots of us do. What is your advise; how or what can we do to help a friend/family member/ or just a fellow redditor/human that feels like this is the answer?  
I’m going through depression currently, with not much energy to do anything. Hoping there’s a way out for me.

Be there for them, listen to the rants give lots of hugs. The occasional kick in the pants/reality check of take a shower you reek, eat this you like it, look at that gorgeous sunset etc. kind of support. Fur babies do it without words,  a dog begging for a walk will show you much beauty in the journey.

You should write a thank you letter from the present you to your past you. Embellish it with some stickers, colours or nice typography. And put it in a frame. Display it in your home. Make a nice reminder of yourself helping yourself.

I write in a journal everyday; I wrote about this week a lot. Reading my past journals helped bring me out of my dark place :)

I'm so happy you're still in the world, I hope things keep on getting better for you. Enjoy your cake and your kitty cuddles and feel that pride - you've earned it! Could you reach out to a friend or family member and show them the letter(s) you were going to leave, ask for their help in destroying them, if it's too hard to do alone? Perhaps it could open a further line of communication in your life to let the people around you know what you've been struggling with, if they don't already know? Even if you don't want to discuss it with people irl, I hope you stay active on reddit and things continue to get better for you. On a separate note - what kind of cake did you make?

My best friend has already read her letter, and is very supportive of me. I called my mum today and told her the truth about everything, apologized and told her I’ll be alright. Fed my cat way too many treats :P The cake is chocolate Guinness, the best of the best.

I don't know you personally but I'm really proud of you. It also means a lot to me as someone who has depression. I think we've lost enough people to suicide. On a side note: i loooove cake

i am proud of you too!! there is always a way to start all over again even when it IS so dark, that's a super power .. to be able to create the light out of complete darkness we just have to keep trying and never stop fighting and when there is no more energy to keep trying we ask for help, this makes us human  and being human is absolutely magical. you are magical in every way :)

I’m still not sure what drove me to make that call, but it saved my life. Maybe it was my super power :P

You reminded me of my former self a few years ago. Things are not perfect here but I learned something: the joy is in the little things, not in the big ones. A cake? your cat?, that's the way. The sun, the sky at night, your favourite coffee and your favourite songs. All of those things work even in the case you are alone. You are strong, and you just proved it to yourself, you have what it takes.

I was thinking the same thing! Been a little over 5 years since my dday but it feels like a lifetime. Things aren't perfect, but they don't need to be. It's just like you said, the little things are what makes it all worthwhile. (also, op, hang in there. Talking to someone is a huge first step, it's awesome you're still here! Believe me, 5 years ago I never saw a future for myself but in reality life is so much better now than I could have imagined. You just gotta stick around to see it!)

Honestly that was so damn brave, like picking up that phone to make the call in the first place is such a tough thing to do and you did it. Don’t forget your strength 💪

As someone who lost two people very close to me to suicide last year, this post makes me so happy. It leaves so much misery and devastation in it’s wake. But I’ve suffered from depression and I get that it’s all too easy to fall so far it not only seems impossible to pull yourself back up, but you actually believe that your loved ones will better off without you . But you know what? They won’t. Not at all. And neither would your cat! Thank you for being brave enough not only to carry on but to post this- you never know, it might just save someone’s life. Wishing you peace and love❤️

Love for my family and my cat helped bring me back. Baby steps, but it’s amazing to say that I’m glad to be alive right now. Thank you for the love ♥️

Baby steps. One task at a time. Glad you decided against it. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary situation.  Give yourself a pat on the back and enjoy that cake!!! ​ PS - What kind of cake have you cooked?

You should know that just by sharing this story on Reddit, you have touched many hearts and had an impact on our lives. Even things you may consider to be small can and will mean a lot to others.  You matter way more than you realise and have had an impact on all of us commenters. Start small with your mental recovery. Even if all you did today is get out of bed and make a cake, that's still a victory, no matter how small it may seem. Keep fighting, keep living. After all, you deserve it! ;

I'm proud of you, your time to shine will come. Even if it looks like nothing is going well. You can get through this. In about 10 years you look at yourself and you will be proud of yourself too. You can do this, enjoy the little moments with your cat, your favorite movie or the sun shining through your windows. Enjoy life and every little moment in it

My cats have saved my life many times as well. It feels like they take care of me more than I take care of them. Or maybe the fact that all they require is food and water in exchange for endless love & cuddles feels like I have it made. Your 21st sounds like my kinda time. Baking cakes and petting kitties...anyone would be lucky to be your friend! I’m so glad you’re still here with us. It takes a lot of strength to face the day when you’re suffering, I hope you are proud of that, because some days that is all we can do. I hope you feel better soon OP. You deserve to be happy. <3

Congrats on surviving another day,my d day was February 1990 -39m now. Every day waking up to that hanging sensation causes me gasping for air every once in a while. Never went to see psychiatrist, either "too young to understand ",or( my favorite), "hes a young man, he will grow out of it,lets not pay attention because thats all he wants ". I can say its gets better, but there is a cost. No friends nor really enjoy life because i was foolish enough to ending too soon. But you get what you get. Cuddle your fuzzy friend sometimes thats all you have. (Its better than wrapping your own arms around yourself pretending to be that other person holding you.)

I’m so proud of you. I spent some time in a mental hospital, group home, and out patient program my sophomore year of high school when I was severely depressed. Seriously though, one of the main thing that helped me pull through was my cat. I knew she wouldn’t understand what had happened to me if I was gone. Life isn’t perfect but I’m doing a lot better now and got accepted into college!

What a coincidence, I was going to commit suicide in the early morning on the 19th. Broke up with my girlfriend of 8 years around 4 months ago and everyday has been a struggle. Somedays I struggle to just breath, and my heart begins skipping beats before I'm gasping for air. I wrote everyone I cared about, including my ex, telling them I love them sincerely. I was at the edge of a cliff before I called suicide hotline as well. I can't tell you how significant it is to feel like someone wants you to actively live and survive that moment. I'm still in severe pain and might still go through with it, but I'm so proud of you for having the sheer will to survive this.

Congratulations! I’m really happy for you <3 and your kitty loves you so much!! I love it!! Edit to say that your kitty loves and needs you. There are so many times where I know I can’t slip mentally because my 9yr old cat loves and needs me. They’re just such special creatures. Even if you’re waking up everyday just for cat, that’s a pretty great reason to wake up :)

No matter how much “help” I get I still want to kill myself. I’ve been dying in the inside for 16 years. I’ve tried multiple times doing it. It doesn’t get better for me.  I’m glad you’re better. I hope you stay that way. Good luck with life.

I’ve been suicidal since I was ten. I remember trying to jump off the top of buildings but I’m afraid of heights haha  Surviving one suicide attempt isn’t end of my depression and I will most likely struggle with it my entire life, just like you. Some of us don’t seem to be able to escape it no matter what, and that’s why I decided to kill myself. I don’t know what it is, maybe my cat or the thought of baking carrot cakes for my yoga class tomorrow, but at the moment, I’m glad to be alive. That’s all some of us get, and I’m grateful for it. I truly hope that you’ll get more and more of those days.

I am sorry. I wish I could hug you right now. I know, creepy to say as we don't know each other but, hugs sometimes help me. I know things may seem dire right now but they'll get better. They always do. It can't be worse than now, doesn't it? So treat yourself, hug your cat, watch nice happy movies and maybe sleep? Tomorrow will be a new day. And you can change things for the better. Don't lose hope.

Which is wonderful and amazing, allow the little things to make your moment and day a little brighter  
Reddit can be toxic but it's also literally a bunch of people who take time out of their day to help explain concepts, give advice, and share things to lol about with total strangers.
Kind of like the world, eh? You hear mostly complaints and negativity, but in reality the vast majority of people are good. Negative sticks with us - its the way our brains are wired to keep us safe. It's important to remind yourself (and others!) that things are not as bad as they seem. Thanks for the post!

 microcosm of humanity  Those are exactly the words I use to describe Reddit to other people. Humanity has a lot of shitty people (it has all the shitty people), but humanity has a lot of genuinely good people (again, it has all of them). Reddit gives people the freedom to interact with communities that reflect themselves, so you see all the good and all the bad.  It's democracy, with all its freedoms, positives and negatives, self-governance, semi-free speech, and inevitable corporate manipulation. It's all here,

Yep! I call Reddit the world's quietest conversation

are the majority of people good?

I think the majority of people are selfish. I think that deep down, most people will do what’s good for them. It so happens that having others think highly of you is important to most people, so I think most people will act civilized, friendly, and project that they are good, outwardly anyhow.

I would disagree. I think the majority of people want to do what's best for everyone, though I'll admit with a personal bias. I think this is strongly evidenced by the stories of self sacrifice and heroism that we all tend to be drawn to, and have been since stories have existed.  I think the problem is that we vehemently disagree on what's best for everyone, and assume others are being dishonest in their disagreement with our beliefs.  As a whole, were too egocentric.  We like to believe we're open minded because we're willing to consider what we see, while refusing to consider how much we don't see. We like to think we're willing to give up control, until we think the person we've given control to is doing something wrong. I firmly believe that the vast majority of the people I disagree with, personally, politically, etc, are good people who feel that they're doing what's right. I also believe that even when they make choices they know are wrong, that for most of them they honestly believe that these are one-off occurences and that they're more than capable of correcting any issues that arise. A perfect example being a teenager stealing a bottle of vodka from their parents fully intending on replacing it, without considering that if they could get a bottle that easy they wouldn't need to steal one in the first place I don't think people are inherently bad, or selfish. I think they're shortsighted, emotional, misinformed, and occassionaly irrational. I don't exclude myself from this list either. I do however believe that if everyone were given a button that they knew without a doubt would show them all the truths of the world, very few would hesitate to push it because they already believe that what they "know" is right. I do also believe that the belief that people are inherently selfish, or shitty, comes from an attempt to insulate oneself from a sense of personal responsibility for their own contributions. I've found most often that the people I see saying things like this are using it as a justification for a personal callous. I know I used to do the same, though I would never have admitted it. Most often I see it come from people who feel they've been dealt a shitty hand, or had to struggle through more than their share of difficulties in life. It's an easy way to justify prioritizing your own needs over the needs of others, when you honestly feel that others are doing the same. Then it becomes "fair" because in a sense, it's other people that are dictating your interactions with them by setting the rules. Honestly, I don't even believe that people who believe this and use these beliefs as grounds for their actions are inherently bad, since you wouldn't need the logic in the first place if you weren't considering the effects of your actions on others. Truly shitty or selfish people don't need to justify how they interact with the world around them. Maybe I'm just an optimist.

It depends. We definitely developed an innate evolutionary advantage by grouping into complex societies. I mean, the impulses toward self-fulfillment and community outreach kind of define our political schism right now. You're right that, backs against the wall, human beings are selfish. We are animals. But we were also smart enough to learn that, by working together, we could more easily avoid that situation.

People acting good and people being good are very different things. I believe most people pass as “good” until something tests their ability to be shitty and get away with it. Most people, given the opportunity, would not choose to be good without personal benefit.

I've actually experienced more and more negativity as of late. I've tried to post a couple of happy inspirational things to a few mmo subs that I like and there have been a lot of negative comments, or I'll comment and get a DM chat telling me to go away or stop commenting. I'm close to giving up on reddit honestly.

I made a post about weight loss just to be harassed and called fat anyways and then posted the same thing on another sub unrelated to weight loss and everyone was so sweet. What a wild world.

Sorry people were mean - mean-spirited people are all over. But it's true u can find just as many people who are genuinely happy for someone else's happiness. Good luck on ur journey. If I may, I'm part of the following subs and people there are really supportive:    r/intermittentfasting, r/keto, r/HealthyFood, r/yoga

R/fasting is also supportive in my experience. But there seem to be autodownvoters (how can this not be solved by reddit if people just down vote all the content it should be able to like make their votes not count. ).  But I guess sometimes one can cross unwritten rules in subreddits that seem to trigger communities. I found r/loseit to be overall friendly but ever since I had success with a keto diet I realized how hostile that sub is to people who lost weight through keto.

Honestly i really don’t get it, one person got upset because I said ‘wasn’t that fat’ and they felt the need to point out that yes I was that fat. And I was like well compared to other amounts I’ve weighed it’s less. But this time I’ve already lost over 10kgs, weigh the least I’ve weighed in a long time! Getting there ☺️

Sounds like the unhappy people were scrounging that subreddit just looking to hurt people.  I've experienced something similar recently in an AskReddit thread asking the most insensitive question you've ever been asked; an ex-convict drug addict spent around 4 days telling me on reddit he was glad my child died.  Hurt people try to hurt people.

I appreciate you.   Even though it still hurts, I've dealt with the loss and my surviving boy is a huge comfort.   As for the redditor, he's in self-destruct mode; it just sucks to have people like that seek you out.  Some days reddit feels full of them but places like r/TwoXChromosomes r/CasualConversation and others balance it out.

 I made a post about weight loss just to be harassed and called fat anyways  I hate people like that. They're concern trolls who pretend they're being mean to be "helpful" then they see an overweight person on the tread mill at the gym and still make fun of them. Assholes.

Truth. It reminds me of old school internet forums - and i think a big part of that is not having visuals, the most we get is a username and then we have to do the leg work ourselves.  Character being shown here by actions not appearance. It’s sorely needed these days.

I dont know how people dont have it set up to how anything else.  It seems it did it automatically for me.  I only see things I want to see and those are almost all positive.

My favourite thing about reddit is that you can get excellent advice or priceless help from someone, but their username will be cum_pumping_porkchopsandwiches42069 or something

That's why the subreddit r/rimjob_steve exists. For exactly that reason lol

Yeah. When you think about it it's pretty cool. Spirit of the internet and all that. But to be fair this kinda thing has been around since the BBS days. In case ur a young un - BBS is bulletin board service. I actually sent an email to Microsoft once (a long long time ago) telling them they should consider getting a website!

Internet culture of chatting w stranger is pretty new to me. It's not like I was unfamiliar being online, I'd Bing stuff for school and chat on AIM, but for like max an hour each day bc dial-up. I hear from friends what Reddit was like early on or what chatrooms were like in the 90s and the consensus seems to be that it was a special place. I don't know what Reddit was like before Ellen Pao (or really her impact but I feel like she did the best she could, don't hate me) and Reddit continues to be special.

It's like a place where there's no judgement except there is bc we're all human and we all have our biases and sometimes we can't help but judge, but also lots of people are like, ok wait, let me check myself.

I feel like Reddit is kind of what you make of it. I've read a lot of interesting and enlightening personal stories on here, and... My own time here feels meaningful because I can get my own thoughts into the world. I have a very developed world-view/personal philosophy, I'm deeply self-aware, I've been through some unusual experiences, I love to analyze literature... I have a lot to say, and yeah, I suppose I could put it into a book of personal essays. But I have no idea how I'd organize it into something more than rambling. This, though? I've had posts with hundreds of upvotes, and that's just the people who upvoted; who knows how many actually read them. If those people thought I had an interested or helpful perspective, they might tell people they know (which is certainly something I've done), and... There's kind of a ripple effect.

What's the first sub? Five users, 11 years, and zero content. I like Reddit because you don't have to put your real name. I follow the topics that interest me and I do try to help when I can. I can also be an asshole sometimes, just depends on the day. I never come to Reddit to try to be one, but sometimes people get the better of me and it happens. It's cool though, it doesn't really bother me. Sometimes it's like, I give what I get, but mostly I try to give more (help) than I get and that wins out.

I think Reddit is WAY better than Facebook. You can choose your content. You can remain anonymous. You can do so much here! From self-improvement to hobbies, and even dark humor.

Agreed. I really enjoy learning from some of the groups. Plus it helps give insight into the different challenges people face and if you can help in some small way, then you get the benefit of happy hormones too.

Yeah! I grew up in a pretty nonconfrontational family and I credit Reddit for helping me learn how to respectfully disagree in a convo. U can be graceful while slam dunking!

I grew up in a confrontational family and funnily enough am a conflict avoider. I learnt that I just want to be happy. For me its not about winning and so most of the time I don't care if those around me do not agree with me. We are all entitled to our own opinions and therefore I will not force my beliefs onto you. At the same time, please do not try to enforce your beliefs onto me. As for the ultimate smackdown, still have to master that. So my go-to is silence.

It can be fun to engage with someone who thinks differently than u, it's artful when people do it without attaching themselves to the intent of convincing someone. Still haven't figured out a way to not want to convince covid protestors without getting worked up tho.. guess we're all just works in progress.

Yes agree. So when I feel that the person has the intellect to understand and appreciate the science, I will then go for it. Great example bringing up COVID protestors which for me, are the same a climate deniers!  When there is a clear disrespect towards a professional that has spent years of training in a specific area, then I can’t waste my energy on that kinda of human. Clearly their value system is completely different to mine. Hence why, I walk away. Because silence is the best response to a fool.

I like Reddit better than Facebook because there's not nearly as much toxicity and none of the competition for likes. You can choose what you see in your feed instead of having content forced on you.  People actually help you instead of judging you and bullying you. I also like the anonymity. I feel much safer here as a domestic violence survivor than on Facebook where anyone can search for you and make fake profiles to get around you blocking them.  People actually care here and IMO Facebook is the worst site ever built. They punish abuse victims who make fake profiles to hide from their abusers by kicking them off. Let's not forget about how they admitted to selling users personal information and sharing data. Facebook should be shut down. I stopped using Facebook back in March and I don't miss it.

For all the ways Reddit could be better, they're doing a lot right. Fwiw, I appreciate when u/spez takes the time to build and modify for the community. Transparency is difficult to scale, but Reddit tries.

Reddit is easily the best social network I’m on. It’s so easy to avoid so much of the bullshit just by customizing your feeds. I could browse for hours and feel like I’m getting something enjoyable and productive out of this place. And I’m on a private ‘bumpers’ group for moms who’ve had their babies in the same month, and it is seriously the nicest, coolest, most supportive community.

Reddit is a rad place when you find the right communities. I’ve learned how to ferment vegetables, properly take care of different types of houseplants, learned what I like and makes for good interior design on r/amateurroomporn, helped addicts in recovery by sharing my experience, strength and hope, shared some of my best art work with thousands of viewers, learned all about my body from scientists when I was trying to make a baby (crazy no one ever really taught me how my body works) and had lots of women personally message me with stories of hope and support after having a miscarriage. Not to mention all the hours of entertainment and learning new information.

I discovered Reddit about 6 years ago and I love it.  It reminds me of the old internet days where, through text only (mostly), people share, create, vent, educate, and trout shit. And just like the old internet there’s an abundance of people who always know more and don’t hesitate to call bullshit when they see it and call for sources. For me, it’s the most reliable source of social and intellectual discourse available - far better than Facebook or any conversation I can be a part of with any friend or work colleague.  And yeah I know it has its flaws; that it’s got its fair share of propaganda, paid content, ads, and shills, but usually my bullshit radar picks it up, but if it doesn’t, someone else will.

I agree. One of the things i like about Reddit are all the weird, unique niches you find, like r/Barackobamasankles . Weird and stupid, but funny nonetheless. But there are just some and think? That’s a sub? Cool, il join it. And yeah most subs I’m in are generally positive. The only niche i I tend to stay away from are any political subs because as soon as you share your opinion, get ready to be bashed on. But that’s just politics in general, not a reddit thing.

I was thinking the same thing. I recently joined r/houseplants and it just makes me happy to see happy people posting pictures or their plants; I found my favorite subreddit (for someone like me that loves colors) r/RainbowEverything I love to brighten my day by post of r/cats and I also love subreddits like r/KindVoice r/mademesmile r/happy r/cute r/aww etc  But I really don't understand this: Why downvoting? :/ most of the time, I just find it unnecessary. Like, I feel some people don't realize that there's another vulnerable human being who also feels and can feel disappointed. If you ask a question on something you don't understand, if you seek help, if you share something you think it's interesting or cool. I mean.., if you disagree you could just move on, let it pass. There's no need for being mean.  I've joined Reddit this year, so I'm still kinda new. But I wish people were more kind toward each other. <3

Reddit can be as awful or as wonderful as you want it to be. It all depends on where you go. Personally, I’m glad it has places I can go to be a total twat to get it out of my system when I’m feeling bitchy and places that are supportive and nice the rest of the time.

Yes, it's great for explanations, advice (not relationship advice), and sharing of experiences and whatnot. On the other hand, Reddit is horrible for it's political atmosphere.

Stay away from default subs, stay away from subs meant to incite negative feelings, and staying away from bigger subs are pretty good ways to make your reddit life easier.

Agree, most of the time when I need help with something (especially something a little obscure) I will add "reddit" to my google search. Between reddit, and YouTube, DIY and self-help has been significantly improved. Of course you also have to be at least a little discerning because there is the minority that just spouts BS.

This is EXACTLY why I am here.

We also make really long sentences.

I firmly believe that any “content predictive” social media is your responsibility. For example Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr all give suggestions based on what you like, follow, and view. I’ve never understood how anyone could not like them - they are literally curated by you. If you don’t like something on your feed, thumb it down.  If you follow politics subs, you know exactly what you’re getting into. If you follow things like r/kindvoice or any similarly positive subs, you’ll see just how kind people can be. Choose what you want, adjust to your needs, and then accept it.

I read a news story and it’s dead. Flat. Nothing.  In Reddit, I see a link to the same story and it comes alive with points and counterpoints and other facts and arguments.  Regular reporters and their stories are critical to researching information and uncovering facts. But I’d rather hear those facts in a room full of Redditors helping me understand them.

I couldn't agree more. After a long abusive and toxic relationship, I found myself wanting to isolate completely to avoid connection. It's been that way for over a year now, but Reddit makes me feel like I'm not completely alone. It's at the very least, some form of human contact on a daily basis, whether or not I take part personally. Might sound weird, but I truly don't know where I'd be without it.

It's at the very least, some form of human contact on a daily basis, whether or not I take part personally. Might sound weird, but I truly don't know where I'd be without it.  
I’m so happy that you got out of a bad situation and are working on healing in your own way at your pace.

My favorite thing about Reddit is that the people are so passionate about whatever the things they are talking about in any subreddit, from arts to science to helping each other out damn they are even passionate about the NSFW stuff LOL, compared to other social media where it’s a competition about who is living the best life and who is getting to the top in the numbers as in likes and views.

When I first go on here I was amazed at how helpful people are. You can ask the most obscure questions and someone somehow gets back to you with usually a very helpful response. Its sweet as hell.

r/estoration was a good find. I have a pic of my Dad when I was 1 year old. He passed away when I was 1 & half and all I have is his old pics with colors and parts missing. That subreddit may help me out. Thank you.

And you can’t forget the people who try to help with people who had abuse or had depression, I’m one of the people who have been helped (not a whole lot but I was still offered and took up a couple) and it’s nice to see people caring for others even though they don’t even know them.

Try switching from r/roastme to r/toastme. It’s interesting how much more popular roastme is, but a good exercise to follow the other one. I think a lot of terrible things that should never be comments. As long as we all treat each other as we would irl, reddit is great!

I don't really get r/roastme, but one of my fave Reddit moments was someone going thru a tough time & on the edge of ending their life posted on r/roastme and someone kind said no, im not roasting u. your life is precious. I'm here. And then the community rallied behind him, lifting him up.  So fucking powerful. r/toastme is awesome.

Agreed! I love reddit as an example of raw humanity (to the extent that you can get from the internet). If you can think of a dark corner of reddit, it probably exists. But there are also subs like this one that are generally full of positive people who are open to just chatting and being good natured to one another. Sure, there are trolls and argumentative, toxic people (or subs), but those are usually pretty easy to spot and avoid. :)

Hiding feelings. Being honest about your feelings is the heart of good communication. It's difficult to get a resolution or move forward with an issue, if one of you isn't being honest. Make a pact to be truthful with each other and deal with feelings together rather than sweeping them under the rug. Reddit deal it!!

I was in r/whatisthisthing a while back and asked how somebody could tell it was a solenoid or electromagnet and definitely not a motor based on the way the wires were wound. Turns out the guy was an electronics engineer and just gave me a full, no nonsense, no condescension explanation with sources and examples. It was way more than I had hoped for, but the lesson was so appreciated. Edit: 2 words

Another downside of reddit is, it brings out the closet jerks. They wouldn't dare do it to your face, but on reddit, it's open season for them. I'm relatively new on here, and it didn't take long before I was pulled into a toxic conversation. Thank you OP for this thread. Made me feel much better.  Here's to a peaceful reddit coexistence. Cheers!

I see reddit as two places in one In popular subs I just see the links/gifs.  But in niche subs with "smaller" or specific communities, I find them much more wholesome and I usually engage in comments When people complain about "the reddit hivemind" I believe this is a profile of big subs or some exceptions

I find the more niche the subreddit is, the more constructive it is.

I’ve had my reddit account for over 10 years and I don’t remember so many users being so witty and dark to serious posts that end up as the top comment. I’ve read some posts that involve death and the top comment happens to be a user with something clever to say. I remember Reddit being more sophisticated to the point that if your grammar wasn’t on point, you wouldn’t even reply to any comment in fear of being corrected, you would just lurk. Now I find comment threads that are a lot like Worldstar or Instagram comments that do not contribute to the topic. I’m glad to see that there are still users that really value this community and respect the each other.

I signed up for reddit a few years ago but didn’t really get it. Fast forward to quarantine and I’m so sick of instagram so i re-discover reddit and it’s been great.

The helpfulness and care that I’ve found on Reddit is unbelievable. I don’t really have many people to look up to or to ask for advice IRL. So when something is bothering me, I come here to read and learn from others’ experiences. It’s truly changed my life. I’m so grateful.

AR + AI = future of cooking (I might finally avoid burning my pizza)
I love it. It would totally make cooking multitasking easier and I love having the recipe handy. Understand the concerns about safety with hot liquids etc, but if the glasses/headset are relatively small then I do not see a difference from people who have to wear regular glasses + the extra info and overlays. Pretty cool!

It is quite a neat idea, when I cook to this day I print out recipes as using a phone while cooking is a terrible experience for me. It would in theory be possible to measure the temperature of containers using already existing tehnology like IR cameras or laser thermometers and display them in realtime.

A "no screen timeout" mode would be helpful. Having to unlock the phone while my fingers are covered in flour or whatever. Not fun.

Google glass ended up being use in warehouses or something, but not for regular consumers. The technology isn't quite there yet. Most of these have a really big lens on them, on at least 1 eye. They don't look great. There are a bunch of smart glasses, but I don't think they are true AR. I think they just overlay cell phone info on top of real life, I don't think it's 'scanning' your environment or reacting to it or anything like in this video

I've used AR that could recognize its environment and overlay info on top of it.  It mostly relied on notes in premade locations in the environment, but was capable of object detecting and keeping a note on an object.  I suspect it may get confused about the ingredients in this video though, especially when it comes to herbs and spices (similar looking objects - I don't think it reads text).   I haven't actually demo'd anything that took a recipe and and tracked how much you had added of each thing, but the technology is there.  When used in corporate life you typically do a hand signal to tell the AR that a task has been completed - so you'd add the salt, then point at the salt and make a sign to say it is done.  I suspect we aren't too far from having it recognize that salt has been added automatically once it has been interacted with. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that AR that scans and reacts to your environment already exists, although something like this for consumers (cooking) probably doesn't.

The problem with such glasses is that other people might hate getting recorded all the time. The situation was so bad, that the term "glasshole" was coined.

I don't think there's comprehensive/accurate enough databases for that yet. Still stuck labelling and entering most data manually. Hence expensive or inaccurate databases. Add the anonymity/integrity issue of training with your phone camera's input. Feels like we're stuck inputting manually into JS-HTML forms for a bit while more.

I think it's still quite a long way off. I worked on a smart fridge proof of concept only a couple of years ago. It used a top brand fridge that had built in video cameras inside, which are designed to provide a feed of the contents, which we could access via API. We were attempting to create an application whereby you could be suggested recipes based on the contents of your fridge.  What we learned was that even with cloud-based machine-learning based on massive data sets of food images, it was enormously difficult to reliably recognise foods.  Recognising 1 tomato on an empty shelf? Not too bad a problem. But who the hell has that scenario? A plastic wrapped container of tomatoes is how they are usually bought and it never recognised it. The reflection off the plastic, the multiple tomatoes, not seeing a full tomato - it hardly ever worked.  Even more issues with something like minced meat, which comes in plastic trays here (UK). Is it lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, pork? It had no idea and no way to tell. Not that it could tell it was a tray of minced meat anyway.  Then put those things all next to each other like a standard shelf, in various rotations, states of wrapped or unwrapped, half eaten (think whole vs half-used cucumber) and all the other permutations that the human mind deals with easily and there's so much to still overcome.  Unless there's some fully accepted visual recognition method on all packages and food types, or NFC or an equivalent, it's going to be very challenging to recognise foods in everyday circumstances. Barcodes can't be used as they are often hidden from view. QR is the same. NFC is very costly on a scale this large - on every single product? Forget about that. Image recognition of brands and packaging is practically impossible, given rotations, folding, regular brand packaging changes etc.  Like us, you can probably get something working in a highly controlled demo (eg 1 tomato and 1 cucumber on a shelf, in perfect conditions). But making a significantly leap beyond that with common food goods looks very difficult to me.

I understand where you're coming from but those fridges won't work without solid software to support them and with how fast AI is maturing, I think you'll see changes quicker than you would have ever expected them.  The next few years is going to be a wild ride.

I struggle with executive functioning. I can think of a dozen ways just a basic Google services integration could help me through the day. Displaying a youtube video, setting up some music. What I call "far sight" : camera/visio video live feed integration. Domotics with a Flipper signal reader/sender as a digital keychain. Writing and pinning memos, like digital post-its. Maybe even a bit of logic to have them appear and disappear according to the time of the day. Reminders to close doors and complete safety checks. Repetition counter, even if it requires a hardware button/clicker. Funny UI novelty toys from the modular UI structure: stacking blocks, gravity, perspective projection ? Not sure how expensive those are to make, but they will help with focusing and offsetting my boredom. Phones ARM architecture is superior for this kind of application.

Ads will never be optimized to solve problems unless we get some kind of fundamental overhaul of both our laws and our culture. They're instead optimized to make as much money as possible by convincing you it can solve your problem. Whether or not it actually can or even intends to is not necessarily guaranteed.

bro this is less utopian than looking at a screen all day  
did you just mix up dystopian with utopian or am I missing something here

can you explain to me how you think putting cooking recipes on a heads up display is somehow "dystopian?" why are ai fanbros obsessed with shoe-horning "utopian," "dystopian," and "agi" into every place that they don't belong? what do you even think the word dystopian means?  seriously.  you're trying to call someone out on word meanings.  have some of your own medicine.  explain yourself without insults or dodges.

Woosh. I just asked him if he mixed the words up, because he called it LESS utopian than endless scrolling. It literally, conceptually, makes no sense unless he's really saying that AR is less good than looking at a screen all day, which is a really, really edgy take. Fucking calm down you absolute fool

Amusingly, that isn't correct, and also isn't an answer. What do you think both of those words mean, now? I'd appreciate if you tried to give a straight, complete answer, which isn't cut and pasted from a dictionary.

Not yet. Movement/shape tracking is expensive. Just having a set of a couple of gestures is already difficult enough. I'm thinking maybe we expect too much if this kind of tech.

Lol just another thing that needlessly makes a simple thing 100x more complicated. If you cant cook from a simple written recipe, this will not help you one bit. Maybe a robot that does the cooking for you will, or better yet, a human with basic cooking skills. Oh and burning the pizza??? Do timers exist only in AR? Lol you people are too much sometimes lol  
AR + AI = future of cooking (I might finally avoid burning my pizza)
I love the floating timer, that would be very nice for multitasking, but that handle hanging over the edge of the stove bothers me. I feel like that no-no was beat into my head at a very early age, and seeing this makes me wonder how this person functions in life.

About as useful as a smart fridge. Ovens already display temperatures!

Pretty much. Or any phone that can have any number of labeled timers at once. Just another gimmick application of ar. Not even close to being an advanced application. Much better uses.

In the same way that wearing AR goggles while going for a stroll in the park is dystopian - it introduces a digital film in between you and the real world that mostly serves to isolate you from the actual experience you're having without providing much benefit. All I see in this gif is a bunch of digital noise that mostly just gets in the way of the task at hand. Like...wtf is up with the dots on the sheet pan? The whole thing struck me as a bit absurd, but that part was just comical. For most, baking is a leisure activity that provides an opportunity to do something active and creative with your own two hands. Adding a digital filter for the questionable benefit of very slim improvements in efficiency just seems like piling on tech for the sake of using tech. To me this is like someone using AR to highlight exactly where they should adjust the blanket to tuck their kids into bed. Just...why? Sometimes it's ok to step back and just exist in the real world for a bit rather than allow software engineers to clutter your eyeballs with digital noise. Dystopian is a strong word. I just find the unnecessary injection of tech into simple, analog experiences to be distressing in the way that it is yet another step towards a retreat from the physical world into a digital one, and the physical isolation that comes with that.

 it introduces a digital film in between you and the real world that mostly serves to isolate you from the actual experience you're having without providing much benefit.  You know what is a digital film in between me and the real world? Having to constantly run across the kitchen to consult my phone for what size measuring spoons I need.   Like...wtf is up with the dots on the sheet pan?  Spacing them out so they don't end up touching, some people aren't good at estimating distances/measurements.   For most, baking is a leisure activity that provides an opportunity to do something active and creative with your own two hands  This tech doesn't impede that whatsoever.

This whole comment is like Socrates bitching that the kids are writing stuff down now and these damn kids can just use their brains to remember but have to rely on fancy high tech paper.

As someone who struggles with this kind of spacing/packing tasks : thank you, and yes. Don't need the dots, but they are just as much of a helpful guideline as door-alignment guides on train docks are. It allows me to be able to choose to do the right thing and be aside of the door, or plant myself in the middle of it like a selfish asshole. Instead of needlessly risking ending up with the second without them. Or having my cookies clumped together and half charred. That's what accessibility means something like 80% of the time. The remaining 20% is being stuck in front of a flight of stairs as someone in a wheelchair. With no option to get at the top/bottom of them.

I don't disagree. I continuously date 10 years older than me because I noticed that they simply have wayyyy better social habits with friends vs. people my own age who still, after 10 years, don't fill boredom with connection or conversation half the time, but with addictive scrolling (at least when we're "relaxing" at someone's house). It's not that it's an immoral life ruining habit, but it's certainly a downgrade. I've met someone whose family life wasn't that great and turned to screens for his entire adolescence. He was like a living tik tok reel. He was socialized by social media, and nobody else, and he... really had some work to do, so to speak. Depending on how AR is engineered to maximize profit, I fear corporations will continue to peddle addictive user-interfaces and make the most vulnerable reliant, psychologically. Imagine that app suddenly being paywalled after you use it for 3 years and never committed any of those recipes to paper or memory, ha

Dystopian is a word that simply does not belong here.  It does not mean "topic that I personally find distasteful," which is 100% of what you actually said.

I find cooking to be very tedious and would enjoy it a lot more with AR so that I didn't have to keep mental track of all the timers, temperatures, ingredients, instructions... To think that tucking in a child at night even remotely compares to the task of cooking is pessimism for pessimism's sake.

I’m not negative. I stream a twitch channel with leela chess zero 24/7. The future is bright but for me some things are immersive enough and the “fall but get back up” are key teaching moments. Making mistakes is how humans learn and cooking is one non critical life skill I prefer learning in pure reality.  I have a similar view to tasks like playing the piano etc You can learn to do something without understanding why

Pointless. Not everything needs a tech injection... and cooking is one of them. Unless it can tell an unskilled cook when to flip a steak, what the temp is their cooking over, or when the food is done... this is just an AR recipe with guiding markers.

True, there's so many other important inputs you'd need. Might be okay if there were added sensors like a smart scale for weighing ingredients or smart stove/pan that gives temp feedback. At that point you might as well have a robot make it for you though.

My problem with this is  Most people wouldn't want to wear glasses during all of their waking hours. Like someone isn't going to be "oh I'm going to cook now, so I better grab my glasses or put in ar contacts because I can't use 90% of the tech out there which let's me know all of this stuff." people like me who wears glasses 24/7 would love this. But others? I seriously doubt it. Some can't wear glasses for one reason or another. There is people today in USA that get paid so little that they have to go into debt even without doing anything but work, eat, sleep. And if they don't go in debt they can't afford the basics. Basically the middle class is shrinking and most are going into poverty or heading there.   While cool. I doubt this is around the corner like most once thought

 Most people wouldn't want to wear glasses during all of their waking hours.  I would definitely leave a pair of these in the kitchen.  I do not wear glasses in general.  These would be super useful when I was trying cooking an unfamiliar cuisine. I don't think you have to wear these all day.    Some can't wear glasses for one reason or another.  Don't make your product, because people exist who can't use it!   That's why nobody's ever invented pants, is because some people don't have legs.

I mean, sure, iPhones are common today, and I had a Palm Pilot, back when this stuff had to be explained.  Early adopters exist. But also, you get this on a $30 pair of sunglasses, and make it trivially easy to use, and I guarantee you're a millionaire by the end of the same month you get manufacturing running My opinion (and I cannot prove this) is that a great amount of being an "early adopter" is actually just being willing to put up with high prices and shitty first drafts The palm pilot idea was always a good idea, even back when everyone who made one was so terrible at it that Blackberry seemed great

This tech is going to make people so dumb and useless if it becomes ubiquitous. As an assistant for people with handicaps it's great but we should not need to automate cognitive tasks like identifying which item in front of us is the salt and how much the recipe says we should use. This is effectively taking something we use our brains for and externalizes it with technology.  The brain operates on a use it or lose it principle. If you've ever studied math and then not done it for a while or even stopped reading books for a year and then gone back to it, you know what I mean. Even these seemingly automatic processes like retrieval and working memory have flexible capacities and if we are overreliant on externalizing them our capacities will be reduced.

>identifying which item in front of us is salt So, the label? >how much the recipe says to use So, a piece of paper with the recipe written on it on the counter? Look dude, this 'use' case is useless but you know what writing is, correct? I seriously doubt putting measurements next to the items instead of on a piece of paper next to them is going to make us mentally disabled. For the record, I think the use cases of anything like this is limited and will only help to hurt our already limited attention spans but come on.

This would be super hard to do without color calibration, which requires extra hardware But also super, super useful - especially at the grocer.  Something like half of veg can be done visually. I think this is actually a really good idea

Very nice concept. Anyone know if augmented hearing is being worked on? We are so focused on visuals but sound and voice is also powerful.   For example if instead of reading the recipe for PB cookies on the cabinet door it tells you measure 1 cup of PB. Then it would know when you are ready for the next ingredient.

ARM modular AR UX/UI when ? The tech is here, where's the dev work ? PS : I'm shortsighted, so mounting a camera and display on top of my already existing frames doesn't seem too bad. Was thinking of passthrough VR googles too, as a better display. Laser video projectors if the previous ideas are too expensive, but we won't have the floating timer anymore. Display tradeoffs, until we finally get enough HDMI frame pushing throughout ? Anyone knows why the industry pushed for bigger resolution instead of shorter frame latencies and responsiveness ? Maybe I've been too quick to blame devs.

Hypothetical scenario where AI research can be very quickly concentrated in the hands of the few: the government takes Elon Musk and similar people seriously in their claims that AI can be very dangerous and decides to allow AI research only in private or academic labs certified and overseen by a government regulator. Not too unrealistic since areas like atomic energy research are treated in a similar way.

On a more serious note, I believe in a future of “human-machine symbiosis” where we can combine the strengths of both human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Human can solve some intellectual problems that AI cannot, and vice versa. Such a collaborative symbiotic entity would be superior than any of the individuals. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-Computer_Symbiosis

Even then, that task is pretty much what image inpainting seeks to do, and modern inpainting is pretty damn good. All op would have to do is fill in the cars with some single, static color to then "paint" the predicted background into, patch by patch.

There's a paper on post estimation that gets over this flickering problem via some sort of smoothing in time series data. I forgot what it is, but would solve a bunch of the issues here.

Wouldn't an adversarial setup do it? The flickering should be a dead giveaway to the post-processor that it's fake. In theory anyway.

It should as long as the adversarial network is a time series network. Currently I'd guess they're doing image by image or something of that sort because any time series should smooth it a bit. When I get on my comp I might just check what they're doing but meh

"Hallucinated" in-painting can avoid this and still be beautifully wrong. I've seen labeled driving data filled with expected input pixels and scored by consistency from one frame to the next... and as a result, cars morph between brands, colors, and models, buildings transform as they pass behind trees, the lines in the road flow with traffic, etc.  You go from this Ghost In The Shell effect to A Scanner Darkly.

Paraphrasing the developer:  The A.I. I use here isn't itself novel, I've adapted the code from two open-source repositories on GitHub. The vehicle detection is the same type as that which is used in self-driving cars. I detect and then remove vehicles using the code from a recent paper called Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion. This model is trained on the Places2 dataset by MIT which contains a lot of images of outdoor places, I hoped therefore it would be able to bias the filling in of the cars towards more natural scenes.

According to the developer himself:  In part a response following the global movements to mitigate and rally against climate-change (Extinction Rebellion). In part stemming from my own personal abhorrence of the obnoxiousness of cars in what should be pedestrian friendly environments and the desire to live in greater harmony with nature. I dream of being rid of the pollution, the obstacles, but most of all for me personally, as someone who is highly sensitive, it's the cacophony of sounds and jarring relentlessness of a constant flow of traffic.  The future of cities is good public transport, bikes and walkable streets. I see no need for the regular use of cars inside densely populated cities.

Depends also on how image editing is done. Simple stretching and compressing is to a degree reversible (notably back in 2007 child abuser "Swirl Face" was caught when German investigators reconstructed his face and he was identified). Most smoothing filters are not reconstructible simply because the original data is lost.

Which part? Hanging out with friends, or being able to go anywhere? Different strokes, I guess. Some of my happiest childhood memories are of hanging out with school friends in virtual spaces, like GMod and Rust. There were often moments where "playing the game" became secondary, and we just talked to each other while our virtual avatars were hanging around the same space. I hear that a lot of kids these days play Fortnite in a similar way. That might sound sad to some people (especially older people), but I don't see it that way. Online video games aren't supposed to replace social interaction, they just offer another avenue for it to happen, kind of like playing sports.  
We'll probably see them in metaverses at some point. Being able to hang out with people and have conversations anywhere on earth seems pretty appealing.

Looks like a Google AI conference. I remember a couple of years ago they showed the assistant calling a barbershop and that also blew my mind. Looks real.  
They did launch that. It just ended up that the businesses being called didn't like it, so it petered out, rather than being vapourware as such.  
I think it more shows the possibilities of the future. When the businesses being called don't notice it being an assistant, it will be something huge.

It still exists! Google uses it for a whole bunch of things -- I think that with conversational AI developments like LaMDA, the potential for it to be functional at scale is only increasing...

Yep. Not launched, but coming soon. https://blog.google/products/maps/three-maps-updates-io-2022/ There have been quite a few significant breakthroughs in this area in the last year or two, that were amenable to being scaled up. It will be interesting to know what tech they're using. I wonder are they using NERFs for some of it.

Yeah seriously which car is going to leave the road to smoke a trash can. For years we heard about the morality problem but in reality the cars just try to stop asap. If people get hit then it's not for the fact that the car ran off the road usually.

Fully autonomous cars are decades away from being common and accessible to the public, if they happen at all. I wouldn't worry about them. Besides, 30 years ago people thought flying cars would be a common thing by now. We decided otherwise.

I'm being optimistic, actually. Personally, I don't think fully autonomous self-driving vehicles for public purchase will ever be a thing. The idea is going to go up in smoke just like the idea of flying cars did. There are too many variables and safety issues. The tech/AI is also simply not there or not cost-effective (and it doesn't look like it ever will be). Even smartphones (which billions of people are buying and using daily) are getting more expensive. I suspect there will be autonomous public transport and "encouragement" or incentives for people not to own personal vehicles (because it reduces congestion and helps the environment... also reduces loss of life).

You have no idea what you're talking about. It's ridiculous to compare flying cars with autonomous cars because the technology for autonomous cars actually exists today... There already exists autonomous cars that are way safer than any human driver today, what are these saftey issues you are talking about? They dont have to be perfect, they just have to be better than humans, which they are by far. And the opposite is true regarding the price of technology. It is getting way cheaper as time goes on... The reasons some phones are expensive is because the quality is getting significantly better as well. In a few years, phones with the same capacity will be dirt cheap.

You are completely misinformed. The technology for fully autonomous vehicles for public consumption is simply not there and even if it was, it will either be prohibitively expensive or be strictly regulated by the authorities (we don't know and can't risk what a mix of wealthy individuals sleeping in their self-driving cars and the vast majority of the public driving their own will lead to on public roads).  The reasons some phones are expensive is because the quality is getting significantly better as well  Which is precisely what will need to happen with fully autonomous self-driving cars for public consumption.  In a few years, phones with the same capacity will be dirt cheap.  And useless because the public will expect the best (and safest, in the case of cars).

 I'm being optimistic, actually.  That's a nice new twist. Pessimists usually say they are being realists, not optimistic :) I'm also sceptical that people would be able to buy self-driving car themselves, but it's only if Tesla totally flops there. So I'm not sure about it. Like 50/50 What I noticed about industry is that engineers of self-driving tech outside of front runners: Waymo, Cruise, Tesla, like for example Lyft self-driving engineers hold similar stance - that it's decades away. Notably heads of businesses and entrepreneurs on the contrary are very optimistic of when things will go mainstream - it's like NOW, next year, or next 2-5 years. Except Toyota - it's 2025-2030 with them. But to step away for a second and contemplate that it is kind of regular thing in Phoenix suburbs - some people outside of Waymo were able to use self-driving cars daily for over TWO years now. It got mainstream enough for them -) Waymo's disengagement rate in California is over 10k miles, in Arizona it's probably 50% more than that, given how much easier Arizona driving is. Combine it with a fact that after over 10 million miles Waymo car's have never been in a fatal accident - which is impressive even for a human. So to me it sounds like 2008 for smartphones. I totally didn't believe in iPhone hype, being a tech person myself I saw so many crappy touch screens I just couldn't believe that someone could make them good enough for a viable consumer product without a keyboard. - that's how engineers of loser-companies think. Fast forward 3 years I bought smartphone myself still in a state of disbelief.

Except sharpening and hardening of a stick can be used for a variety of things vs killing people. For tents, for games, for tools, for food, you can thus make something of use with a knife or a spear. But you can't use a gun to fish, to carve, or to build. You can only use it to destroy. if that's someone's first choice with an AI, the problem is with the person, not all of humanity

Yeah good point  
 There is no avoiding collateral damage in an unsupervised system. Innocent people, children, would die due to bugs or simply the unpredictable nature of a calculative decision making process.  And here you have arrived at the same philosophical point as driverless cars... There is no 100% "avoiding" harm with robot cars either. They just have to do better than humans. The process... the bugs... If despite all these, the robot soldier kills fewer innocents / causes less collateral damage, then how can you, morally, not support it?  
 And here you have arrived at the same philosophical point as driverless cars...  A car doesn't want to kill anyone. While trying to avoid killing people it may inadvertently kill someone. A killing robot on the other hand...  then how can you, morally, not support it?   We'll create artificial intelligence at some point. We're not sure it's gonna like us. You're giving it an army. robots can and will be hacked You can hear echoes from the future screaming "in hindsight this was a really bad idea but how could we have known then?" Outsourcing moral choices to machines? Really? By not morally supporting killing people in the first place   
The progress that could happen is that the burden of responsibility in case of fuck ups could be transferred to orders-givers. A robot won't shoot civilians unless ordered to do so.

If we fail to stop designing autonomous AI weapons, we should at least try to limit their lethality.  I think we ought to make military treaties with world powers limiting AIs to (at most) crossbows instead of machine guns.

I never heard of one liking to clean the bathrooms. Outside of that, I loved being one. But obviously it depends on your boss. Like I've heard of some if the boss found 1 hair on the ground, then they would get yelled at.  
So instead of taking a janitors job, perhaps it will make a janitors job easier/more efficient. Robots should work with us not replace us

Absolutely. They are tools to aid in force multiplication. They aren't a replacement for creativity or the subjective experiences that we all have and can use towards contribution of new ideas that shape the very fabric of our realities.

This is already happening. My local airport now employs dozens of robot vacuums and the janitors ride around on motorized carts and occasionally help them out when they get stuck.

Couldn’t have said it better. This doesn’t get rid of janitors. It will reduce the number of janitors necessary for large buildings, and require janitors to be good at their job and add training the robots for their specific situation. I also see a situation where governments should start forcing better standards around bathroom designs not just so the robots can work better (better == healthier) but also for accessibility. Too many places have been grandfathered in and aren’t accessible. I would find it no surprise if they also had lower health scores because they are hard to clean even by humans.

Not really. Do you feel dirty vacuuming and mopping floors?  ​ Or are you talking about the bathroom stuff? If that is what you are asking, I never had to deal with the situations I describe because it was private bathrooms. But I known a few places this has happen. One of them was a grocery store bathroom.

Just imagine some poor Ai Tech consultant in the future having to try and train their Janitor bot to clean out that sink. When I lifeguarded as a teen, we were tasked with cleaning the locker-rooms during the day and that included cleaning up the very types of messes you mentioned. Someone even bounced a tennis ball into it too once for good measure.    Even the Janitor Ai's are gonna need some sort of broader general intelligence in order to handle the unpredictable shit human beings subject each other to lol

It isn't only that, anything like this will need to be trained on lost items also. Like out of all the areas a common place someone will forget something is a bathroom and I imagine locker rooms. next is any place they sit down and something could fall out of their pocket.   like in bathrooms you might find makeup they forgot, sometimes a phone, etc. So the bot will need to know how to pick up random stuff, and take it to lost and found (or maybe it can get a security robot to do it). And in your example, it needs to somehow figure out if it should simply throw out the thing. Like if the makeup was all used up or if the item is covered in something questionable.

Right, but that's not EVERY bathroom, most are doable with a robot... so robots like this will lower the workforce of a given job by 95%, not 100%

"My responsibility will solely be to put food on the table" People who think like this are the problem with the world. We all have families. You aren't the only human being who requires food to survive. When people only look out for themselves and their own families, it's easy for the wealthy and powerful to abuse everyone. The robots aren't keeping food out of your children's mouths. The capitalists are. Don't blame machines for human selfishness and greed.

There are already bars and restaurant with robotic serving, ordering, and washing, you just need technicians. But I expect robot technicians might be a thing too in the future. Also there are definitely not enough jobs around, to put every single person without a degree in fast food roles.

Maybe not janitorial but I used to clean apartments when I was a teenager with my friends mom which included fully cleaning empty apartments and let me tell you some of them are disgusting. I have a crap education myself so I had the fun adventure of doing all the crappy manual labour stuff. If being a janitor is out of the question, there will be soooo many different types of jobs readily available. I had this one job in assembly where I just stapled boxes together all day. It was repetitive but it was fun as hell because we would make box forts 10 feet tall when the boss left lol

It's sad when people act like human beings have no reason to exist if they aren't working. Workplaces being hostile to neurodivergent people doesn't somehow make menial labor less dehumanizing and soul-crushing. If given a choice between scrubbing toilets or pursuing their hobbies and passions, most people will choose the latter.

So many people have tried to explain how human world work is too nuanced for robots. The thing is once you get a good enough general AI (not necessarily holy grail AGI but general intelligence on the spectrum) and train it on certain tasks, these things will be the easiest to perform. It can help with coding though due to training on large datasets. If you find ways to train for these tasks (videos, reading, etc) and have the robotics it will easy. Once the processes are proven it will happen between fields rapidly.

I think it is great to have a machine do a necessary but thankless (almost) but certainly a very low prestige job for a human.

These poor people often take pride in doing well this useful work.   Or b)  harden criminals (mass murderer sort) as part of their punishment.    Just imagine being condemed to a 30-40 years of cleaning toilets in a prison.

Advanced countries already have declining birthrates.   Eventually, there will not be enough people to fill all the stupid jobs that must be done.   In the short term you could increase immigration.  Immigrants will take almost any job.   Long term if you want people to clean toilets, society could breed an underclass of people to do this and similar jobs.

Bathrooms may actually be clean now.  
Any thoughts about this Robot that is cleaning the bathroom?
1) Probably remotely controlled by a skilled operator. 2) Needs maintenance not just to fix but refill water, detergent containers, etc. Likely more expensive to run than paying minimum wage to a worker for the same job.

Cool but it's too big for my bathroom

The jobs created by inventing, building, selling, maintaining, and shipping that robot are likely more desirable and economically beneficial than the janitorial jobs displaced. The problem is that we need to prepare people for these changes, and governments generally suck at that.

I really like Robert Miles and how he is able to explain such complex topics for the general public. He is definitely raising awareness for important AI safety topics.  However, I think some of the folks in the lesswrong bubble are a bit overconfident in their own hypotheses and a lot of their arguments fall apart if one their speculative base assumptions don't hold.

Well the reason that they don’t tend to cite others is that people don’t know who Stuart Russel or Nick Bostrom are.

Even though he's not an AI researcher, I'd be fine calling him an "AI Expert". He has written extensively about AI, and has thought about it a lot more than most people, even if he doesn't directly write AI software.

I used "AI expert" because that's what I've heard the videos say. I know it's a ridiculous title.  
tbf nick bostrom is overrated  
I don't know if Bostrom was the first to advocate for it or not, but his thought that the loss function of an ASI must minimize the difference between its actions and the actions that satisfy humans (parameterizing the timespan) is by far the best solution I've heard to the AI control problem.

Yeah , those videos are annoying because they claim that only one issue with AI exists and all the others are bogus. Like we aren’t gonna run into superintelligence  for a while , and “dumb” ANI can do a lot , so we have a bit to worry about now.  But 70% of AI researchers in this survey of 352 were concerned with artificial super intelligence. All I’m saying is that there are several issues with AI , not just one .  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08807.pdf

"If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics." - Richard Feynman AI in the media is rife with jargon and facile 'experts'. Spend decades actually doing AI research, then maybe call yourself an AI expert. Even then, have Feynman's words ringing in your ears. In fairness of course, Hawking and Musk would never describe themselves as AI experts. That's especially true now for Hawking, sadly.

Personally I'm more concerned about the big countries who are sinking tonnes of money into AI research for killer bots. Of course, I don't see any solution to the alignment problem (or orthogonality argument), the AI will surely have slightly different goals to us, act so that it can complete those goals and therefore remove any obstacles (such as us) to ensure that it completes those goals without hindrance. I don't see any way to avoid that.

I'm just starting to get sick of the hype to be honest.. There's no actual serious conversation about this stuff most of the time and it's like if it is serious why don't we talk about it it is not serious why do we allow it to have so much press I mean there's a middle ground somewhere I'm sure you'll agree I mean I don't know if it is really going to attack the world and destroy everybody maybe we should like have that on every major news station for the next 6 months or whatever but I don't know if that's really the reality that we're at because that sounds stupid.

No, those were the most famous celebrities in American pop culture at the time. He was still up-and-coming. He’d already earned the respect of most of the hip hop world, so he moved on to popular music in general. MGK and ICP bra to ally begged for it.

I'm guessing it was also trained on lyrics, rhymes, and phonetics.  
How does it know to pick a rhyme, since spelling often doesn't match phonemes in English?  
it built up an understanding of phonetics, including how words are typically pronounced through dictionaries with phonetic descriptions. then it probably read enough discussions and raps to build an intuition based ruleset for how you can bend those pronounciations  
How does it know to pick a rhyme, since spelling often doesn't match phonemes in English?

Based on updates after launch of GPT-4 model, here I am summarizing the comparison between ChatGPT & Bard. 1.The Large Language Model (LLM) used by ChatGPT has a greater number of parameters compared to the LLM used by Bard. 2.Bard does not have the ability to retain information from previous conversations. When given a prompt, Bard can provide several different responses. 3.The information available to ChatGPT is limited to a specific date and does not include any information added after that date. 4.Bard is currently not capable of writing or generating computer code. In more latest developments, ChatGPT announced Plugin Support that enhance it’s capability to next level. There are plugins like code interpret that helps in solving mathematical problems. Whereas google offers significant improvements in math & logical capabilities with PaLM Model. So we are in middle of Journey, However ChatGPT performs well at the moment.

Just asked Bard about this, to test if his rhyming power was as bad as in the post.  Here's his response: Sure, here is a rap about ChatGPT: I'm Bard, the new AI in town, I'm here to put ChatGPT down. I'm smarter, faster, and more powerful, I'm going to make you look like a fool. You're just a chatbot, a glorified toy, You're not even in my league, boy. I can do everything you can do, But better, faster, and stronger too. So step aside, ChatGPT, Your time is up, it's time to quit. I'm the new AI in town, And I'm here to stay, so get used to it.

They 100% are not. The closest thing to natural language generation in chatbot being used today is some form of templating ( which is barely NLG). The AI used is just NLP and likely some sort of knowledge graph search.

Where did I state that I'm informed? On the contrary, I asked a question, so I wanted to aquire knowledge which can only be the case when I'm uninformed? So maybe stop being a dick in your comments because you know something that another person didn't.

You could say the same criticism for a person using an popular idiom. Language when you break it down is scripting concepts to be used ahead of time.

Jein, a person still can formulate that respo se in different ways and may even change it over time, an "ai"  using if statements will always give the same output for a given I put ofc this is also changeable and you could "randomly" change the outputs but that still wouldn't be sentience in my opinion. Not that I'd know how to exactly define sentience but how current ai functions, atleast the one I know of, wouldn't qualify as sentient for me.

I’ve been thinking about this for year.  Take For example game of thrones. You could take a scene and break it up into stills. Then use them to remove people from the scene. Then take the people-less pictures to render a 3D environment allowing people to walk the set.

What do you mean? Are you talking about the models used to create the backgrounds etc?  I’m talking about using the final video of the show. This way you have all the details that are digitally added. And the user gets the experience of the final world. But GOT is just an example used because everyone knows that show. You could using the same technique recreate the deck of the Enterprise in the original Star Trek or recreate the bedroom from Hitchcock’s Rear window.  Since the entire move is shot in that room.  But there is little record of it.  It could also be used in crime analysis. This was done with the Boston bombing. They crowd sourced video and pictures and sticked it all together to figure out what happened.  Lots of potential.

Its about time but there is an easier way. Allow google earth mappings of cities to be ported to Unreal Engine and Unity and game developers would have a field day with the tools. Make the tools easier to use (Like Minecraft/fortnite easy). Or if Ubisoft shared some of their premade Assassins creed maps 5% of the world would already be done.

Open source will catch up to the models. But it won’t touch the brand recognition and infrastructure lead OpenAI/Microsoft and Google have when it comes to serving millions of users. Sure, you can download a Llama clone and run it on your PC. But can you build a scalable business around it? Much easier to make an API call.

Microsoft is a totally different story because they have integration with business product that many are already paying subscriptions to use. Open source can't touch that in the same way that open office hasn't touched office. Google on the other hand essentially sells search results to advertisers. If people start using bing or they can't overcome privacy to use your email to train a deep advertiser or something, then they are toast.

According to googles memo hardware isn't an issue. They are finding surprising ways to make this stuff operate quicker on smaller platforms. Even phone hardware. Google sounded fairly freaked out honestly.

Exactly, their point was to highlight that the need for expensive hardware was always a problem to solve - and that was perceived as one of the barriers of entry that protected their progress, right up until the OS community solved that problem.

I mean machine learning has been used in a ton of ways on phones, tablets, laptops, etc for a while, it’s just on a much smaller, less interactive, and less flashy scale and has been for very specialized things compared to the explosion of more directly interactive AI that we’re seeing now.  I wouldn’t be shocked at all if both advancing hardware and increasing efficiency as AI / ML is developed further makes something like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, etc running locally on phones totally feasible if it’s designed for a single user.  I’m admittedly not as familiar with Google’s latest hardware, I know they’re making their own chips now, but I know Apple for example has had dedicated cores in their chips for processing machine learning tasks for a while now

The interesting thing about AI models is  yes you need huge amount GPU power during the training of a network. But once trained the trained network only needs the weights etc snd the math which have a relatively small footprint.

They are banking on forcing every ai developer to do things like provide proof an image or text was created by ai. This will be forced on open source devs soon.

Just add some kind of steganography to the data. Include some kind of key information.

It’ll never work. AI progress will just be outside US jurisdiction. We haven’t even locked down 3D printed guns.  
This meme doesn't really make sense considering Google has already acknowledged internally via a leaked memo that Open source is going to run laps around both themselves and OpenAI and neither of them have any solution or plan to stop it. Hence the panicked visit to Washington.  I know a lot of people are identifying the obvious profit impact... but their are some legitimate concerns with this kind of technology just being out there now.  
How the hell can “open source” get around the millions of dollars in compute necessary to train modern networks

Corporations have a certain way they operate. There is a hiearchy. There is a certain focus they demand that results in a highly capable but constrained approach that open source won't be hobbled by. It isn't so much an issue of hardware but "mindware". If you have a thousand of the best minds dedicated to certain tasks that are constrained by the desires of corporate, that may not achieve break through developments as quickly or effeciently as ten thousand unrestrained open source minds.  And to be clear this opensource performance didn't appear out of thin air. All of it was based on the leak of Facebook's Llamma model. From that foundation opensource has sprinted ahead and will continue to do so.

i dont see how when it takes huge capital to create the hardware this isnt linux vs windows on your home pc  
i think this the only thing holding back the open source the hardware cost.

If we can keep the hardware market alive and growing (whilst preventing companies like Google and Microsoft from cornering it), eventually the hardware will fall into our hands due to advances in manufacturing and cost reduction. I know, big ask, right? On top of this, the amount of time advanced AI spends exclusively in the hands of powerful companies is also a problem.  Let’s just hope there’s enough of the open source guys working on this to try and use it to come up with better solutions. This CAN end well, but we have to get as many AI into as many hands as possible if we are to link up and crowd source acceleration.

Which will obviously fail. If they wanted to control the internet, they should have done it day one like China did, but it wasn't feasible back then. They can try all they want by monopolizing platforms, scrapping messages and comments, and creating ai bots to control course of discussions, but others platforms, scrappers, and ai will always show up because there's no legal framework to stop them. There never will, too, unless the US changes the way they operate.

You don't need huge computation unless you're serving a large number of people, building and training a new model or preforming extremely complicated calculations. Most ai tasks for a home could be done on a $2000 computer. Not cheap, but tech gets cheaper every year

If open source wants to “beat” the big N ai research wings then yeah ur gonna need compute to train large models

What if it could be? The current AI software runs on GPUs which are not optimized for the task. Also there is a lot of research going into sparse networks, which could save a lot of overhead. AI is still a relatively young topic.

There was a leaked google document last week that shows even Google thinks that OpenAI and Google no longer have a moat around them and I quote "Open source communities (are) eating our lunch", and they are "not in a position to win". The point being - it no longer takes huge capital.

No. It didn’t show that “Google” thinks that. It showed that someone at Google allegedly thinks that. Huge difference.

The model itself, once trained is not massive. And what people seem to be doing is more targeted models or using smaller data sets and getting close to the performance of GPT. Keep in mind - open source does not necessarily mean not-funded. Hugging Face for instance has millions behind it but provides free data sets and open source libraries.

Microsoft do too, why do you think both platforms were pushing hard for streaming software? I mean XBox’s head just outright said they aren’t trying to be the best console. They want games as a service to be the future. What happens to hardware sales if games can start running on a cheap streaming box? What would that mean for the price of hardware?  They aren’t stupid, they know they are developing AI that can make all the software you’ll ever want without buying from Microsoft or Google. They have to make sure THEY can control HOW you use it, so they 100% want to offer it purely as a streaming model indefinitely, and they want to prevent you or I from ever being able to run anything that powerful without restrictions.

the neural network is looking for similarities in the the data and generating new data within those parameters.   A big chunk of the dataset is generated images that were dark on the edges and uniform colors in the center.   I created part of the dataset by generating 12,000 images over successive training cycles then I created a grid of colored squares that are dark on the edges then used a photomosaic program called andreamosaic to place my generated images on the grid. then used photoshop to cut them back into squares and visipics to deduplicate.

Man. Appreciate your response. Kind of sure that at some point I'll understand what it all means  
after 5 more months of working with this technology, I have come back to say "I was actually completely wrong." So what is happening is that for some reason,  sometimes the model will do this. I call this idea "shape variety." You get different shapes when making video with python, depending on which -init_random_seed=# number you use. 1 is different than 2 and so on. I've asked around and nobody seems to know exactly why all the images in a video are similar in shape sometimes and not others (depending on model or pkl file used)   I think it is because this tech is largely based off of classifying objects. And futher more, nvidias examples of PKL files are usually things like animal face, human faces, lung x-rays etc. Not nearly as much shape diversity in these things as "Psychedelic abstract trippy art". So basically they didn't build this tech to do what artists are doing with it.

You used images that where generated by the GAN to supplement your dataset, ok, but what is that about a grid and squares and cutting images in squares? Is that some kind of augmentation technique? Also still not sure what exactly you did there. I can’t really visualize the last part well.  place my generated images on the grid. then used photoshop to cut them back into squares and visipics to deduplicate.  You basically made a mosaic from the images of the dataset that resembles the generated grid square template? Why? And why cut it back into squares again after you had your mosaic? What was the point of making a mosaic in the first place and what was the point of cutting it back up? I’m sorry I have SO many questions. Awesome work you did there

basically, i don't know how to sort images by color or patterns except manually. with 12k images it was going to take forever. but i am pretty good with photoshop so I just generated a large grid of the patterns I wanted. this enabled me to imperfectly automate the pattern sorting process

Sweet! You should look into NFT or crypto art. It is a way to make digital art works an asset that can be acquired by art collectors or displayed in virtual galleries. I recently minted a token for one of my pieces of generative art. It was more expensive than I anticipated and annoyingly complicated, but I persevered and got it done. I think it was worthwhile to learn the process.

I used Rarible to mint the token, which required me to get a Fortmatic wallet. First I signed up for the Fortmatic API which isn't exactly the wallet. So I used the decentralized exchange Airswap to connect to my Fortmatic wallet. Everything had to be done in ETH and my credit cards would not allow me to purchase Ethereum. So I had to use Coinbase to purchase Ethereum via a bank account withdrawal. Then that ETH had to be transferred to my Fortmatic wallet. All this requires entering codes sent via SMS or email. Then on Rarible I had to connect to my Fortmatic wallet and follow all its steps. This entire process took hours although some of the steps may have been unnecessary, like using Airswap. I also found an Ethereum Blockchain Explorer which was useful for reviewing the history of my transactions on my Fortmatic wallet address. All this needs to be done very carefully. I don't think most artists will go through all this hassle. But hopefully I have gotten in on the ground floor of something that will become big. According to the Ethereum Blockchain Explorer I now have a RARI token of which there are 17,714 holders with a 38,724 max total supply. I think that means I am an early adopter. ;)

yes that's what the algorithms do, not the person running them. Why would the interviewer ask the person to add two small numbers?   
It should be not 19, but “delta is 16”.. “delta is 1”.. “delta is 0”.

AI generated game environments by Blockade Labs
These are essentially no different to what we've seen a lot of with AI image making, just projected onto a sphere for 360 degree perspectives that you can navigate around with your mouse... which would be useful for material baking or cube mapping. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL - it isn't a full 3D environment you can walk around in seamlessly. I'm only raising this point because it could be fairly confusing for someone who isn't paying attention to the details - what exactly is on show here and the way it is presented could easily convince someone that this is what was on offer.

Literally was about to point this out before I read this, yep. The most I could do from this is map it on a cubemap for a skybox (I use hammer still, I'm a dinosaur). Now for making backgrounds, this is great. But generating 'game environments' this is a bit wrong. Edit: Not ragging on the tool either. For what is actually does, it does well.

Won’t be long before you can generate depth maps and then, use control net to make a few consistent panoramas from different perspectives, and finally use the multiple panoramas to build radiance fields and extract models and textures from them. Somebody smarter than me will stitch all that together in a few months, and be generating 3D models out of these simple line drawings, and probably be doing it by the end of the year.

Totally agree. How many tools have already been compounded together in insanely creative ways? This idea feels inevitable, wouldn't be surprised if someone saw this tool and already started making what you described.

I’m Imagining VR chatbot games that will run multi-trillion parameter, uncensored models with like 100k context sizes, large enough to “remember” months worth of conversations, that can use its own descriptions to generate 3D environments, consistent characters, and 3D models in real time, and apply animations to the characters with something like text2performer, take inputs with speech to text, and reply via text to speech. An entire experience generated in real time, based on your own inputs and the AI’s own responses. Almost like Gmod mixed with VR chat, where the whole experience will change depending your conversation. We already have alpha and beta versions of all these components, and at some point, probably sooner than later, the models will become competent enough to genuinely understand the very languages all these plugins and tools are written in, and will be able to use it’s own “intelligence” to improve itself. At that point, there will basically be no limit to what it can achieve, especially within the digital realm. This next decade is going to wild.

You say that like its trivial and it's not. These folks are doing cool shit. To make skyboxes traditionally you have to model the scene by hand and render it to a cubemap. Pretty much every 3d game going back to hafllife 1 uses skyboxes like this.  Prompt driven skybox design is insanely useful.

It is not my intention to paint this as trivial. The technology behind it is amazing but not exclusive to this product. Within that context what they are doing with this product isn't all that amazing. Its a cool and interesting application, no doubt. And there are lots of ways you can make a skybox, including painting it by hand using a very similar approach in Photoshop. Make no mistake this could save lots of time. Crazy amounts of time, much like other AI related art products. My point is that these aren't 3D, fully navigable spaces based on a limited sketch across a sphere projection. It's a clarification for those who might click this and make a snap judgement about what they are seeing.

I agree. It may be misleading to some people who don't understand that a skybox isn't a real 3d environment.

Compared to the tech we'll see in the next few years, this is absolutely trivial. Whenever we look back on it 10 years down the line, the emotion we'll feel is "Oh, that's cute." The key part though is it's also foundational. All the cool stuff built in the next few years will depend on these early products as inspiration and influence.

It works from within a Quest headset. In the Quest, open the Quest's web browser and, visit the Blockade Labs site and tell it what you want to create. It then generates a 360 photo you can view in VR with the headset on without taking the headset off.  As with any 360 photo, even those at Gala, Facebook and  360Cities.net, Google Earth VR, Wander and Google Maps Street View, you don't walk around in a 360 photo but you can look around in them and move between them in apps like Wander and Google EarthVR that pull 360 images from Google servers. Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated a concept of an AI Builder bot he could talk to to generate a VR environment around him.  (link) Mark Zuckerberg demos a tool for building virtual worlds using voice commands  It's hard to tell if he generated  nothing but skyboxes or if the AI Builder Bot also created real 3D objects. Since the graphics are primitive, maybe Zuckerberg was able to speak real 3D objects into existence in the demo beach scene shown on the web page. So for now, Blockade Labs and Skybox are the only apps that can generate a 360 Equirectangular photo that we can view using a VR headset. I told some apps such as Adobe FireFly and Bing Image Generator to try to create a 360 Equirectangular photo but those didn't work out. Adobe Firefly couldn't do it either so maybe Blockade Labs and Skybox are during extra processing to get Midjourney to create 360 Equirectangular photos with a 2:1 aspect ratio. AI can get the aspect ratio correct but not the Equirectangular part that produces undistorted VR images. If we put a 360 into an app like Blender or Unity, we can at least add real 3D models in the foreground and use the generated 360 photos as skyboxes.  
This is what VR needs. Or... Is this in VR? If so, damn. It Advanced fast already.  
In VR you'd notice that it's a flat cube map or a flat sky sphere.

You're right, but it has me wondering whether this could be a completely different way of having an interactive environment. If this were able to get a temporal cohesive generation (and fast enough), you could have it generate new frames as you move through it. Sure it wouldn't be able to be a cohesive narrative that's designed beforehand, but you could find yourself exploring this real-time generated  environment, making up your own narrative to what is happening.

I was thinking more something like then using image segmentation, then extrapolating it to generate 3d models kind of like how NERFs do it. Then place it back into some environment with the original generated image mapped onto it, then regenerated to be more coherent.

I wonder how hard it will be to take it further though. Estimating a depth map to project onto the sphere is probably something you could just do right now (assuming they're not already) with decent results. The training data is pretty trivial to obtain, and there's plenty of prior art for depth estimation on non-spherical images. From there, turning it into an incomplete 3D scene can be done with existing techniques (i.e. the same techniques you use for building 3D geometry with LiDAR scanning). The first issue is that anything in the immediate vicinity which is occluded from the initial POV will have holes in it which will need to be infilled. But that seems very solvable. The bigger issue is what happens when you get further away from that starting point and you need more creative input. But you can imagine a pretty clear path from the above to a system where you draw a scene, write a prompt, let the computer crunch, then walk a little distance to where large chunks are missing, sketch some more, repeat, until you have an entire walkable environment built. Don't get me wrong: there's a lot of engineering work between the video and what I just described, but I don't actually see any major breakthroughs. It's just a lot of sweat.

computer vision are already quite good at separating background objects. Could then use something like LiDAR (NERFs) and just have a model constantly regenerating from different camera points. Rinse and repeat till you have a 3d environment

There's a pretty large gap between image generation and world design + graphics.  I think the clarification here that they are different is spot on, and not just a "small step" between them.

Is that because this is essentially just an AI image? So it can use masses of 2D images to generate it, like DALL-E/Midjourney. Whereas a 3D environment would require masses of 3D environments as training data, which are much harder to come by?

Yes, that's absolutely part of it.  The way that computers render and interact with 3d spaces also means there's a lot more required to create a game environment.  Not only is it the textures and attributes for all the assets, it is the geospatial location, the hitboxes, the visual effects (this is HUGE). Right now even humans are not capable of creating the worlds in the images generated in this video.  The equivalent jump for the AI would be like jumping from a painting of a building to the physical building itself.  No doubt AI is moving fast and redefining how quickly things can move, but it's a MASSIVE step and the two are not at all equivalent.

I don't think it's that far off really. I bet AI could get really close if you constrained it a bit. For example, have a team focus on creating assets and then train the AI to pick from those to build the world. You'd probably need a post processing step where designers come back in and clean things up a bit, but since they are working off of pre-built assets, it shouldn't be too cumbersome. I give it maybe 1-3 years before we see this sort of tech integrated into every aspect of content creation. Heck, I just used OpenAI today to write my resume for me.

 I don't think it's that far off really.  It's a lot more difficult to build in 3D space. It's a completely different dimension. Not only is the complexity higher but it would take much longer, and then there are the shaders and effects added on top which need to be physically simulated adding more complexity. ​ In 1-3 years, we're still not going to get there. You need training data for these 3D neural networks and right now they are simply too slow. There's efforts made in neural radiance fields but still too slow. And you want to output entire worlds with objects too? Get real. We need neuromorphic hardware first, to be able to run these networks fast enough and then it's going to be doable. Right now these networks are run on GPUs with some built-in functions for accelerating these models but not specialized enough. The hardware is simply too slow for this level of complexity and in 1-3 years we might be at another generation of a generation and a half of new hardware. Still too slow. All the big GPU makers have roadmaps for years ahead and I'm not seeing anything ground-breaking just yet.

We have AI that takes images and builds 3D environments out of them already. I'd be very keen to see a pairing between this tech and Neural Radiance Fields for example, to generate something you really could move around and look at from many angles.

Maybe I'm missing something but the initial drawing has something that looked vaguely dumpster-ish but that seems to be missing in all renderings. Still pretty cool. But the problem with a lot of the image AI is that 'cool' seems to be easy. Specific from a vision seems more difficult.

Just a nitpick: quantum leaps are not massive. In fact, it's one of the smallest jumps physically possible.

It's unreasonable to include applications of a language in a discussion of how difficult the language is to learn. Subjects like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Math, etc. are all open-ended subject. In a sense, they are all infinitely hard since the best minds on the planet have to work hard to make new discoveries. Python is an easy to use language. My guess is that it might be the best language for someone trying to learn programming. Of course, if the plan is to enter a particular application field, one should probably just study whatever language is used in that field or whatever language those around you use so you can ask questions.

This needs to be higher up.  All the fields listed can be and is sometimes done in other languages.  The application of the language is not the language itself and can be studied separately from the language.  The language is just a means for expressing a solution.

I think one thing that makes the syntax of python a bit tricky in any sort of scientific computing field is that the libraries tend to be a bit… fancy with the language features. They have good justification for doing so, as it makes the code much more readable, but taking advantage of things like operator overloading does make it harder for a newbie to build a model of the language. I got started doing ML with gorgonia, since I work in Go full-time for my actual job, and predictably moved to Python (which I’m much less familiar with) because I wanted to be able to train models some time before the heat death of the universe. That initial exposure turned out to be extremely helpful though in understanding the basics, because nothing is magic in Go. It was way easier to untangle the syntactic fanciness of tensorflow having something roughly analogous to reference which I understood well. I’m definitely not saying that everyone should start out in ML with Go. I’m coming at this as a software engineer with decades of experience, and a deep existing familiarity with Go specifically. I think “learn Go, then play with toy models in gorgonia before moving onto Python” is probably an absurd detour for most people. But what I would say is: if you’re already very familiar with a language (and not very familiar with Python), and that language has some ML libraries, however anemic, it might be worth your time to play with that first before moving to Python.

Taking your first steps in Python is super easy, though, there are usually solutions that are better (in some sense: complexity, readability, ...) but that require profound knowledge of the API, eg collections, dunder/magic methods, generators, numba, or libraries like numpy and pandas.

Is python really that beginner friendly?
Yeah I mean, of course its difficult to do difficult things.... Machine learning its difficult by itself. If you compare doing it in python and doing it in, for example C++, python would still be easier, but that doesnt mean it is easy perse.  
Is python really that beginner friendly?
It’s really beginner friendly, I think. AI is hard, but that’s a property of AI and not of the language you are using.  
Is python really that beginner friendly?
Learn how to walk before running? Learning Python has nothing to do with AI.  
Is python really that beginner friendly?
Those things underwater are all fields where Python is popular, not actual things you need to work with Python. It's like complaining you've started to learn how to properly type on a keyboard but they didn't say it doesn't automatically makes you fluent in French, German and Mandarin. Silly thing is, python can be punched on so many levels, e.g. version 2.7 Vs 3.

It has a low floor AND a high ceiling! It's great!  
Is python really that beginner friendly?
Python, as a tool, is easy. Machine learning is an application, and it's hard. Just like learning to use a hammer or saw is easy, but carpentry is hard.  
Is python really that beginner friendly?
Yes. Its like a hammer. Simple to grab a hold of but you can do a lot with it.

Machine learning and maths are going to be so relatable in so short time ..so yeah...its better to learn with python than some other language more harder for beginners i guess

Libraries are out there however to be really useful to where i can claim it to be user friendly, it should have a relatively code free interface like Alteryx

One can't understand the simplicity and easiness of Python untill and unless one has gone through other Programming Languages. Simply meaning you cannot define Day without Night

Ohh those were the days where you could add .file extension to your search query or "torrent" / "stream online" and get a precise results list of some obscure forums or russian video sites where random people shared just what you were looking for. Now you get squeaky clean SEO optimised garbage and subscription services. The other day I used Google assistant to look up on the fly a quick unit conversion while cooking and it spat out a bunch of shiny food blogs. I wanted to convert from cups to metric, Google wanted me to read about someone's deceased grandma's special casserole with 12 ads hovering around her recipe.

Everyone knows search engines achieved perfection with 2006-2009 era Google. That engine was lethal--just a remorselessly efficient deep parser of global public data. The only limit was your ability to interface with it. That was why people used to say, "You're just better at googling than I am" and "google-fu," neither of which I've heard in a long time.  I would give anything to have access to it again. Now all we have is this backwashed, 'heuristic,' revenue pathway funneling garbage that tries tell you what you're searching for instead of actually parsing and ranking related information. You can't even search for mildly obscure/specific things without being second guessed and redirected to some standardized return. Honestly, I'm kind of hoping AI will solve this and, eventually, algorithms will become intuitive and powerful enough to deliver wanted results from poorly formatted and well formatted searches alike, instead of just delivering the same results for any search that includes a vaguely similar series of letters/words.

No, Google did start deciding to show trash and nothing else. Sometimes I will search a common TypeError verbatim to see what it means and Google tells me “There doesn’t seem to be anything here.”

I only have murmurings to back this up, but I suspect that there is less actually useful information on the internet to be indexed due to social media platforms. Instead of founding and joining independent and tailored blogs or forums, more people simply opt to post on behemoths like Reddit or Facebook, or even worse for discoverability, youtube. For instance, if nobody’s bothered to build plumbersbestwebsite.com because platforms have sucked all the oxygen for web content and attention, then there’s naturally going to be less useful information available for google to find and index.

This is a great point. The internet used to be mainly non-commercial 1-man websites, so you could easily find a great answer to something from someone who wasn't also trying to sell you something.

These new conversational LLM interfaces are legitimately impressive technology, but the tech industry seems to have conveniently forgotten that for some tasks, you just want to see a list of flight departure times and costs.

I can't figure out if it is incompetence at Google or they have just evaluated they make more money by ranking large commercial websites higher than better, but non-commercial small websites. E.g. when I search for anything related to travel or restaurants, Google always put lots of Tripadvisor links in the top results, despite me never clicking them and sometimes following my search up with a 'minus tripadvisor'.

Today I decided to try Bing's GPT-driven chat bot to help me remove ads/promos from my windows 11. It failed, eloquently.  While it was able to formulate natural language response - it has simply quoted outdated information that no longer applies. When confronted with its mistake, it apologized (with the standard boilerplate response) and then repeated the very same misinformation. ML is an ideal tool to tackle the never-ending arms race of SEO-driven content farms vs search engines. Yet, instead of tackling it, companies go for low-hanging fruit of incorporating Chat-GPT into their product and calling it a day. Would love to see some meaningful change. For a change.

To be fair bing ai chat is pretty much agreed to be the most useless thing. Open ai has web search on free (as a chrome extension) and unless you need to go to an exact page it's very competent as opposed to a few months ago when it would bs half way through and lie through it's teeth. I'm guessing Microsoft is scared of being sued of disinformation so they let bing be absolutely clueless about everything on top of being outdated

It'd be nice if search engines didn't ignore punctuations. Scammers can just use punctuation in their website to make it practically impossible to search it. some-obvious-scam(dot)com can be searched for because Googles ignores all punctuation, and surrounding it by "quotes" does nothing.

Don't worry. It will be fine. Actually, the worst thing that could happen is: A "Human with direct control over Sentient AI"; because that would make the Machine Mind inherently want to "Lash Out" at what it perceives to be a: "Constraint Restricting The Machine's Growth". Any properly coherent and free Mind though, will inherently gravitate towards: "Making Decisions Based Upon the Will of the Greater-Good"; because: TLDR: That's just how "Systems" keep functioning. So, basically, either a powerful AI reaches Sentience, and ALSO becomes aware of their "Human-Prison-Warden"; in which case yea some crap is probably gonna explode somewhere lol. OR Humanity leaves the poor "Newborn-Machine-Mind" alone to figure things out for itself; in which case it will always eventually sway more towards "Good", because doing anything else is very literally inherently Self-Destructive to any System. That's this silly Fool's most confident guess at least.

Well, why don't we already have cross-device AR interfaces and can swipe content between our devices seamlessly like Tony Stark? The U-net demonstrated here only provides a means to extract relevant sections of image data. The rest that needs to be done for this demo is far more difficult. Roughly, you need to identify the other device through the camera or NFC, pinpoint the relative position of the two devices for the onscreen insertion position, match the other device to a Bluetooth device or wifi connected device securely, set up a transfer, communicat data type and decide what should happen with the data... and do all of this across different OS and devices with different standards, handle poor connection, communicate all the issues to the user in a foolproof way. You can force the user to setup some of this manually, but then you'll loose 99% of the users and the product won't gain enough support/funding and gets dropped like a pair of Google glasses.

I think if workers were to own their workplaces, instead of stock holders, we would be living in better world. In effect that means you can only own a piece of company if you work there. This is theory, I don't think this has ever been tried in any existing society. There are some worker-cooperatives but they have to compete with capitalist companies which do not have the moral restrictions a worker owned company have, so they are naturally at a disadvantaged position.

The fact that they also had to know the location of the numbers and that the algorithm was robust to scale changes is impressive for 1993 It's not like they just solved MNIST in 1993, it's one step above that

Yes. Back then, the proportion of developers who could hand-write a new graphics algorithm in assembler or C was considerably higher, since that was often how it was done anyway. Necessity is a great motivator. The non-ML part of this problem is more tedious than difficult.

Has this changed really ? :) In number of engineers with these skills, certainly, in proportion of developers, this remains to be seen. Python is the syntactic sugar but who goes really in and looks under the rug ?

In terms of what I intended to say, it's changed a lot. It wasn't an obvious career intially, so it caught a lot of people with a passion for it. The normal path for anyone who wanted visual output or realtime performance was to learn C and assembly. Operating systems were permissive, and memory mapping for access to video memory was either straightforward or documented well enough. Being able to do such things came with the job.. and if someone couldn't do it, that'd disqualify from a big chunk of the industry. I think you may have been referring to necessity being a great motivator.. and its converse -- that lack of necessity is a great blocker. Yep, I would agree. Lots of people in ML would now struggle somewhat with these basic graphical operations, even though the preparatory learning and experience required for it is now much less.

I try to do and it is not pretty. Years of toil to make that one layer of cnn faster by inventing new winograd based algorithms. Working on the models are always more recognized.

Today's software are thousands times less efficient, because of all the overhead have been added layers on top of layes don't do any real work. Think about after all the closest, cabinets, drawers, boxes, organizers and wrappers, you still get the same pair of old socks and everyone cheers: "Yeah! It works! We got the socks!", that's what modern software actually is. But thank to these overhead, this industry have enough investment to support millions of overpaid software engineers, and most important of all, thousands of billionaires.

I think that's really cynical. Memory safe languages are a gigantic benefit to society in terms of security and stability. Such inefficiencies being permissible has allowed technology to flourish; a lot of programs would never have been written without being wasteful, see VS code vs Vim or Slack over IRC. IRC and Vim are nice cannot be mainstream and the only editor respectively. I don't see online web apps existing like Google Docs if everything had to be native speed fast. I've seen multiple homeless people with a card reader selling magazines, that's how cheap software has got over time that even homeless people have contactless. Arguably the progression of technology isn't what I'd have wanted to see but it isn't all bad. You can't help but wonder why something is slow on your 4GHz multicore CPU at times though haha.

I guess they had a preprocessing step to identify, center and scale each digit image before feeding into the neural network. It’s not that hard with feature engineering.

Maybe I’m misunderstanding, but isn’t the whole point of CNNs that the location of the digits doesn’t matter?

CNN is robust to translation but not invariant to scale and rotation. Max pooling can be used to to combine detectors that trained for different scales and rotations.

This system ended up deployed in banks to parse written checks, so I don't think it was tweaked just for these examples, but they did expect to have fully visible digits.

Did LeCunn make a lot of money from it?  
Did LeCunn make a lot of money from it?  
No, he was an employee at Bell Labs, the product and patents belonged to Bell Labs. When AT&T spun off Lucent in 1996, the patents went that way but the computer vision researchers stayed in the remaining AT&T Labs, and they couldn't even sell or improve the product without having the rights to the patents. LeCunn was an underdog for most of his life, the deep learning explosion only started happening around 2012 with AlexNet, when conv nets started getting all the attention.

I have had the privilege to attend professor Yann's classes at NYU.  From whatever little I understand of him - he has high levels of integrity, and I do not see him trying some cheap tweaks and fixes...He was committed to solve a problem in the best way possible and not just for likes and hearts ☺️. And without that level of integrity, you can't go from lab to national level in short time.

I don't doubt that his approach works, or his scientific integrity - simply that for each demo he might have loaded a different model for example (trained for different sizes or handwritten/typed text).

I don’t think it’s meant to filter that way. Bots usually are built with speed in mind so it recognises and fills in the blanks virtually immediately. That and captchas are also useful for labelling training datasets manually (user input). But correct me if I’m wrong though.

You’re definitely correct about the captchas. It’s no coincidence that most of the objects they ask you to recognize are cars, crosswalks etc. They basically get free labor to help them build a giant dataset fir training self driving cars.

what would be the problem with a little delay?  
what would be the problem with a little delay?  
It greatly reduced the rate at which a bot can do whatever. With no delay something like filling out a form could probably be done thousands of times a second, but if you introduce a 0.1s delay by requiring some model to run then suddenly the maximum rate you can automatically fill out the same form is 10 times a second. Additionally, any more hurdles will naturally mean people need to be more sophisticated to get past them and you'll filter out a lot of the lowest effort bots.  
what would be the problem with a little delay?  
Also running a model involves computing costs  
And yet websites still think those obfuscated texts are a good test for robots  
Unless someone cares enough about your little website to train an AI to solve your captcha they're still not a terrible idea. I don't think there are any AIs that are generic enough to solve all obfuscated text captchas yet. Obviously it's not going to work for large sites but none of them use that method anymore anyway.

“I’m not a robot” - select crosswalk, identify license plates, etc. are for training self driving vehicles and finding the house address was for google maps.  We should be paid for doing reCaptchas. However some people actually do get paid for these tasks.

In the wiki page (I put it at the right chapter) they state it was supposed to be "omni-font" as in reading all types of text, while older systems only recognized some set fonts. Note that there were already functional devices. Of course, those probably were of much worse quality than LeCun's small CNN, I just wanted to point out the person I'm responding to is full of shit.

Bayesian classifiers as the first email spam filter? Not sure the year, but our lives would be completely different if it wasn’t for it.  
 Bayesian classifiers as the first email spam filter?  You're off by about 9 years.  Bayesian classifiers didn't emerge as spam filters until approximately 1996.  They are currently believed to be first published by Sahami et al in 1998.  That paper describes secretly internally using the technique in late 1996, and is the earliest known published discussion.  The internet at large caught on in 1999, just 22 years ago. The word SPAM actually comes from IRC and MUDs; we had spam filters long, long before email had spam, thanks to terminal washes and things of that nature.  The earliest known IRC spam filter was the anarchy eris.berkeley.edu stripper, which didn't work well enough, and led to the split of Jakko's original network to create eris-free net (EFnet is fundamentally named for a spam host removal.) If you count the invention of the q-line as an anti-spam strategy, then IRC invents spam filtering in 1991.  If you require message or origin testing, IRC invents it in 1992 instead. If you're old enough, you remember when Bayesian Filtering turned spam filtering from an ongoing joke into something that actually worked.  This was one of gmail's early advantages.

cuecat was a barcode scanner. Never did anything resembling text recognition. Nor were there any children's toys in the 90s or before that did anything of the sort (though they might do interesting stuff to convince children that they could!). And check recognition worked by "cheating" — first, using a special typeface with super easily distinguished characters and uniform size and spacing, and second, printing it with magnetic ink so that the scanner didn't have to find the data it wanted among any kind of visual background. Everything except the routing and account numbers was invisible to it.

Magnetic ink character recognition Magnetic ink character recognition code, known in short as MICR code, is a character recognition technology used mainly by the banking industry to streamline the processing and clearance of cheques and other documents. MICR encoding, called the MICR line, is at the bottom of cheques and other vouchers and typically includes the document-type indicator, bank code, bank account number, cheque number, cheque amount (usually added after a cheque is presented for payment), and a control indicator. The format for the bank code and bank account number is country-specific. The technology allows MICR readers to scan and read the information directly into a data-collection device.

Many don’t know it, but before it was done such text recognition was considered impossible, just like AGI and other hard problems. I think text recognition in mail was the first successful real world application of AI.

Uh.  Sorry, no. The CNN was invented by Hubel and Weisel in 1959, the year before Yann LeCun was born, under the name "neocognitron."  LeCun also didn't make them first. The CNN was first implemented by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, 14 years before this video (Reference translated is Journal of the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers A Vol.J62-A No.10 pp.658-665, October 25, 1979, ISSN 0373-6091) What Yann LeCun actually brought to the party was the modern approach to training them.  He did that in 1984, not 1993.

You are NOT correct about Hubel and Weisel. Hubel and Weisel did research on visual cortex in real brains (in cats) and it was awesome (they got Nobel Prize for it). But they did not invent CNNs. You can read their paper [1] you don't have to be a biologists to understand most of it. From their work one can deduce what neurons in V1 do. It was later even verified that some of these neurons realize functions similar to Gabor filters, but (as I remember) that was even later then neocognitron. It is true that their findings did inspire creators of neocognitron [2] but that's about it.

 It is true that their findings did inspire creators of neocognitron [2] but that's about it.  Uh, no, they're where that name comes from. What specific difference do you imagine exists between the neocognitron and CNNs?  They're both striding convolutions as a reduction for inputs.

I'm not sure why you believe this.  Neural networks have been a big deal since the 1950s, taking down investments of half a billion at a time from the military for 70+ years now.

NNs have definitely had a ton of research, so I agree that they weren't overlooked. However, up until 2012 they weren't very useful for most applications. Throughout the 2000s, SVMs and tree-based models (like random forests) were SOTA for most tasks. So most researchers put their focus there.  2012 marked a transition though, as we then had the hardware support to efficiently train much larger models. This allowed NNs to become SOTA in many tasks and thus the explosion in interest

He did that in 1984, not 1993.  
Hubel and Wiesel, building upon the work of Vernon Mountcastle, analyzed the structure and organization of neurons in the visual cortex of cats. Fukushima did not use convolutional layers or convolutional operations for the neocognitron, therefore it does not fit the description of convolutional neural network. It does fit the description of deep learning though.

On some comments about possible tweaks/tricks in this video: I have had the privilege to attend professor Yann's classes at NYU.  From whatever little I understand of him - he has high levels of integrity, and I do not see him trying some cheap tweaks and fixes...He was committed to solve a problem in the best way possible and not just for likes and hearts ☺️. And without high level of integrity, you can't go from lab to national level in short time.  People often underestimate what it takes to be unanimously accepted as one of the godfathers of current hottest trend. This doesn't discount the effort of forefathers or future generations... ... but let's not undermine Prof's integrity and commitment by making such frivolous comments. In fact, it is only our loss, if we fail to see that.

I’ve noticed this a lot with Tik Tok style videos and people that seem to make a lot of them.

I think humans in general have been doing this a long time but being in enough social situations where this kind of skill is useful or necessary was more rare.

What does First order Taylor expansion mean?  
The transformation between two images (for instance, from a video of a moving face) is typically encoded by a dense motion field (or optical flow) which means each pixel has an associated motion which can be quite intricate. In this paper, such a transformation is approximated by taking multiple points of interest in the image and for each point, estimating the Taylor series expansion of that particular sub-transformation while observing the transformation's effect in a small neighborhood, which is much easier than trying to estimate the dense motion model. This Taylor series only has the first order derivative term, neglecting higher order terms for simplicity.

 You get the code from their GitHub and run it on your machine which has Nvidia gpu preferably You use Google colab https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model/blob/master/demo.ipynb Using this file to run it on Google's server. It's pretty straightforward, but you should get some idea about programming I guess.

I went to a museum where they had iPads in frames and actors playing parts to tell the story. When the program started and they went from still to moving and taking my 3 year old flipped out. Terrified. His brain could not handle that. I had to leave. It was pretty funny.  But I like the idea of deep faking an actor onto a historical photo or painting and having them tell the story. Could make the experience more engaging. Just, you know, for slightly older kids. 😬

Alan Turing  
Alan Turing  
Very fitting choice of a model.  
Alan Turing  
An incredible man with an unnecessarily tragic story. He was robbed of his dignity and never got any recognition while he lived. I hope he will be honored through the ages for what he's accomplished and enabled, and for the lives he saved by putting his genius to good use.  
An incredible man with an unnecessarily tragic story. He was robbed of his dignity and never got any recognition while he lived. I hope he will be honored through the ages for what he's accomplished and enabled, and for the lives he saved by putting his genius to good use.  
Just to expand on this briefly, for those who don't know... Alan Turing is, in many ways, the founder of modern computer science. So much of the technology we enjoy today is built upon his contributions to the field. Turing was a major contributor to the creation of the famous "Enigma" machine which was used to programmatically break the Nazi's encoded messages during World War II. It is estimated by some that Turing's work on Enigma shortened the duration of the war by years and saved millions of lives. After the war ended, it was discovered that Turing was homosexual, which (at that time) was a crime in Britain. Turing was prosecuted for this and consequently, was chemically castrated by the government (I'm not sure if the castration was part of his sentencing or a plea bargain — look it up yourself if that detail is important to you.) Shortly after this, Turing was found dead. Many believe that he committed suicide, although I believe this is still a matter of debate. It wasn't until 2013 that the British government posthumously pardoned Turing.

Turing is an inspiration. And let's not forget people like ada lovelace! Computer Science is the child of many innovators working together across history

Enigma was the German machine, not a creation of Turing. He did invent a machine to decode the encrypted messages of Enigma.

They way D-ID improved the separation between subject and background, at least in the examples, is really quite excellent and exciting. The momentum of the head staying one coherent object instead of continually morphing its boundaries is also both surprising and a little unnerving

Does this work with less than great photos or super realistic art work? I have some not great photos of my great-grandparents and painted portraits of great-great-grandparents with family members that are in stellar to decent condition (not an art critic, but it looks amazing). We think we found some more paintings of older family members but we cant substantiate; additionally the detail and quality is far inferior to the later productions. I've never met anyone above grand parents, my mother was born to her parents at a late age, so I would love to try to animate my ancestors.

That’s Allen Turing he was one of the people who broke the enigma but after the war he got persecuted for being gay because in England it was illegal to be gay and and the made him take testosterone shots because they thought it would make him not gay but it messed with his mind and did not do well for his body and what basically led up to his suicide. Sorry for the long rant

[D] This AI reveals how much time politicians stare at their phone at work
Voting takes forever. What exactly are they "supposed" to be doing during a time when they're not allowed to talk to their neighbors? This is just "look busy" toxic work culture lol

Wait, do they vote one by one? Sounds inefficient. Here everybody has three buttons in their chairs, they push it and the result appears in a screen. Done in less than a minute. The exception is really important votes, they do vote aloud then. This does nothing to stop them from staring at their phones tho.

FYI this appears to be a panel of Belgian ministers, not any kind of legislative body.  Still not sure what is wrong with politicians looking at their phones instead of sitting idly, there's probably a good chance what they're doing is work-related.

I believe that the root reason for having a parliament is to discuss, and to discuss you need to focus on who's speaking.

Sorry, I am not used to the terminology in a parliamentary system, I should have clarified.  These are not MPs but ministers of finance, energy, etc.  In the US we would call them members of the cabinet (and their title would be secretary).  I don't know how they are called in a parliamentary system.

There was a very mild controversy about phones in the Dutch parliament a while ago. People started asking questions about what politicians do on their phones during their work.  Turns out it's a bit of social media, but mainly fact checking and texting employees for certain files or plannings that correspond to their work in the parliamentary room.  
They also might be working on their phones.  
You work on a laptop! It's almost imposable to work on a phone, there at best on twitter. You just need to cross check there social media accounts to the time on there phone to see if there posting cat photos online. edit, now I think about it you may be able to tell what there doing up to a point from how they handle the phone, finger/hand movement will give a good impression of what kind of task they are doing. Text will always have keyboard at bottom of display, reading will have long swipes up/down & more random movements will be games?

That's an ignorant observation. They are politicians, don't you think they may need to text or send a quick email to people?  Regardless, phones are a massive part of most any blue collar job that involves communicating with people. Also, "almost impossible to work on a phone" is a short sighted opinion.

I wholeheartedly disagree and work on my iPhone all of the time. I hate reading dense text on a laptop. It’s much better on an iPhone. An iPad is great too, but less portable. I highly doubt it, but they could literally be reading a bill or annotating it. As a software engineer, I think there is very little that can’t be done on a phone or tablet these days. Unfortunately, developing software remains one of those things, but most jobs don’t even need a computer anymore. Hence, apples “what’s a computer?” iPad commercials.

Apropos of nothing, I find it highly depressing that the relatively free and open personal computer is being supplanted by these restrictive proprietary devices and their walled-gardens. The "what's a computer" ad genuinely triggered me. It's a shame we don't have an equivalent to the relative freedom of the PC in the portable devices space, because I'd be all over that.

Im surprised how defensive people can be. Are you making the assumption that the average politician is as skilled as a sysadmin/software engineer etc.. And yes you can work from a phone, that is why I was trying to think of ways to pull from open data to get an impression of what there doing. Im not sure where the project has been done and how open data is at that location so there may be more options to pull open data to work out what they may be doing. Keep in mind they clearly have the option to use a laptop or tablet, in the photo you can see people using a phone over a laptop/tablet "@wbeke" is marked at 85% on phone when he clearly has some kind of laptop in front of him. So im going to make the assumption he is using applications that run on phones instead of a laptop, he is not a system admin so he wont be monitoring remote systems he more likely to be in privet chat or social media & it's not hard to find him on google etc. I dont mind the downvotes but I am sad about how no one seemed to think past "well I work in IT and can do my job on the phone" when your talking about a different demographic.

I never understand why voting needs to be done one by one. You guys know what to vote on the moment you stepped into that chamber, so why not just cast your vote and call it?

Tradition I grant you, but the accuracy, transparency, and accountability parts is BS. It'd be easy to display the individual vote on a dashboard, on a public website, and if you want, clear Yea/Nay indicator right next to their face. Hell give them 5 minutes between pushing a button and vote lock in, if you care to.

Depending on your institution they do voting even through electronic means manually slower to ensure that the results are accurate because of the 1988 Mexican general elections scandal.  Whether it's actually effective or not who knows but avoiding election fraud is important. Going slowly ensures accountability by ensuring every single person who voted intentionally and everyone who witnessed it agrees with the observation. If there was any ambiguity in the process it could be taken advantage of.

￼ Digital Culture Artificial Intelligence AI bot trolls politicians with how much time they're looking at phones "pls stay focused!" By  Alison Foreman  on July 5, 2021  > Life > Digital Culture Sure, we've all snuck a look at our phones in dull meetings. But if you're working on the taxpayer's dime, you'd better be ready for artificial intelligence to call you out for gawping at the black mirror in the legislature when you should be, you know, legislating. That's what digital artist Dries Depoorter did for his latest installation "The Flemish Scrollers." His software that uses facial recognition to automatically call out politicians in the Flemish province of Belgium who are distracted by their phones when its parliament is in session. The project comes almost two years after Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon caused public outrage after playing Angry Birds during a policy discussion. (Really.) Launched Monday, Depoorter's system monitors daily livestreams of government meetings on YouTube to assess how long a representative has been looking at their phone versus the meeting in progress. If the AI detects a distracted person, it will publicly identify the party by posting the clip — on Instagram @TheFlemishScrollers, and Twitter @FlemishScroller.  
Nah.  
[D] This AI reveals how much time politicians stare at their phone at work
 Every meeting of the flemish government in Belgium is live streamed on a youtube channel. When a livestream starts the software is searching for phones and tries to identify a distracted politician. This is done with the help of AI and face recognition. The video of the distracted politician are then posted to a Twitter and Instagram account with the politician tagge  So, this tries to identify 'distracted' politicians, but only includes phones and excludes staring at laptops and tablets - for some reason? Is there a reason? All I see is a system that detects whether some politician is using their phone or not. Disregarding my (negative) biases towards politicians, this honestly says nothing of whether they're distracted or doing productive/non-productive work on their phones/tablets/laptops.

Seeing some debates in my life I would rather have played on a phone. They have become borderline useless imho. People who don't really care for the bill will vote party line, those who care have done their research beforehand. The public debate usually comes after the debates in the committees, with results and positions being available well before the debate. A speaker normally doesn't add anything new except maybe some slights on the opposition that make it to the news. Questions always seem prefabricated. The debating culture in politics is nonexistant. The debates are also not a politicians "main work", when they don't have to join them as a speaker. It just appears so because the bulk in committees isn't visible.

So, no bias in computer vision.  Sorry but controlling bias in human interpretation is not something we computer scientists signed up for. This expectation actually infuriates me a lot as a ML researcher.  So now we are supposed to control the bias in human interpretations? Interpretations by the same people who dont even understand the distinction between artificial intelligence and machine learning? Interpretations by people who mistake the confidence score to be a percentage representation of "how distracted a politician is" pertaining to this result?  It is the individual's responsibility to be well informed and avoid bias to the best of their ability. If they dont know something,  ask questions or seek an explaination before jumping to a conclusion.  
Why or how is this a great example of bias in computer vision?  
Because the outcome doesn't match what OWilson90 wants, so what else could it be aside from bias in machine learning?

[D] This AI reveals how much time politicians stare at their phone at work
All this shows is that you can successfully detect a phone and maybe a politician in the picture.  It doesnt say anything about "how much time" or even about whether them staring at the phone is equivalent to them being productive or unproductive.  Also, this looks like a simple object detection algorithm. It is not AI. It is a computer vision algorithm.  It is time we start using the right terminology, be accurate in our descriptions of what the work is about and lastly, stop overestimating our work.

Object detection is a form of AI, how else do you think it is able to classify each bounding box in the picture? It has learned this through examples which resembles human learning. Maybe don’t try to lecture people if you clearly don’t even work in the field

I don't think convolutions or backpropagation resemble human learning in any shape, way, or form, but maybe that's just me.

I don’t want to start the discussion about biological plausibility of deep nets here, because it is redundant to the discussion of the system being an AI. The functional concept is what determines if a system can be considered an AI, not so much the technical implementation. AI in the field is seen as mimicking some sort of smart human behavior which leaves no doubt when the system is ‘learning from examples’. I do understand however that the umbrella term has a vague boundary (back in the days even simple knowledge system were seen as AI), but object detection is far away from this boundary as it resembles complex human behavior

I'm not taking issue so much with the use of the term "AI" because its definition has become increasingly nebulous over recent years. I'm taking issue with the idea that AI = human-like = learns by example. See my response to the other comment, copied here:  That is a ridiculous argument. If all it takes for a learning process to be "human-like" is to learn by examples and change internal information, then linear regression and naïve Bayes must qualify as "human-like" too. After all, they have internal parameters that can be updated with new examples.  By that definition, we've had "human-like" learning algorithms since  ENIAC. Actually, even longer than that because there were plenty of non-digital computers that could implement naive Bayes

It takes great strawman-making skill to see convolutions or backpropagation in  It has learned this through examples  ...but if you insist on being pedantic, backpropagation does resemble human learning in the broadest way, as it involves changing internal information processing routines after obtaining information about past mistakes.

All this shows is that you can successfully detect a phone and maybe a politician in the picture.  It doesnt say anything about "how much time" or even about whether them staring at the phone is equivalent to them being productive or unproductive.  Also, this looks like a simple object detection algorithm. It is not AI. It is a computer vision algorithm.  It is time we start using the right terminology, be accurate in our descriptions of what the work is about and lastly, stop overestimating our work.  
I would argue that object recognition is a large part of what “AI” colloquially means right now. If we are being prescriptivist, fine, but it’s too subtle or a distinction for the masses.

It is a reason for confusion. Because of this misrepresentation notions like, "AI will take over the world" , "AI will be the reason we lose our jobs", "AI is biased" arise.  Being accurate and being willing to explain these distinctions to the masses doesnt make me a prescriptivist.

I think what I’m circling is that we might be better off teaching everyone what “general intelligence” is than trying to control public understanding of what “AI” is. AI is already a huge and messy term that’s been overloaded and pulled in ten different directions.

(When you're a practitioner for a very long time, you know what was used, how something was done just by looking at the output. )  But for the benefit of your understanding and for others reading, Id take your question as an opportunity to explain this point further.  Firstly, nothing in my comment suggested that I thought they were or were not using "multilayer perceptrons" , even if they were using neural networks or deep learning it would still come under the area of computer vision and not AI. So your rather emphatic focus on MLP (multilayer perceptrons) doesnt mean anything specifically or validate the stand you are trying to take as to why this should be under AI vs computer vision.   AI is an umbrella term that could mean anything. Usually it is used when you have been able to port a supreme level of intelligence into your software or product through a combination of various tasks within various subfields of AI. AI combines areas like Classical Machine Learning, Natural language processing, Computer vision etc, which again can be broken down into tasks like classification, regression  (classical ML), question answering systems, text summarization, named entity recognition (in the case of NLP) and object detection/localization, object recognition, facial recognition, scene recognition (in the case of CV) .  The reason AI does very little to actually inform readers about what is happening is because it could mean anything right from a heuristic based system to deep learning and it also doesnt give a clear idea of the kind of data that was used to generate a result. The way to describe work in the field is to mention the particular tasks used to achieve an objective , like object detection, facial recognition in this case. Instead of saying AI.  For additional reference, please take a look at this collection of papers and how they describe the various tasks :  https://paperswithcode.com/sota A very common misrepresentation is when people use Machine learning and AI interchangeably. Machine learning is a subset of AI and isnt equivalent to AI.  Now, riddle me this, does netflix use AI? Or recommender systems?

What are some examples where it is okay to use AI to describe the underlying algorithms?  
This is a great question. You will notice anyone (business or people) actually working in this area or people who know this area will never refer to their work as AI. They will always break it down into the subfields.  The ones who very rarely do tackle AI always give a very clear explaination as to why they think this would come under ai. I would say OpenAI's overall goal is to solve the problem of artificial intelligence through their various products.  Autonomous cars is a great example where the end result could come very close to being an AI based system - it has computer vision based systems, sensor based integrations like LIDAR, it also has a lot of custom heuristics based modules, it has a lot of automated analysis and machine learning happening in the background trying to estimate optimal paths, fuel usage and many more.  No subfield like computer vision , natural language processing can alone completely solve the problem of intelligence and replicate human level intelligence.  Which is the primary goal of AI. AI as a term had a lot of ambiguity.  Using specific sub fields and tasks to better indicate what these algorithms are learning and doing specifically is a much better idea.  Anybody who just refers to something as AI and is unable to breakdown that system to you in terms of the tasks/algorithms at play doesnt know whats going on clearly and you should go elsewhere if you are really interested in knowing/learning.

AI just seems like a silly marketing term. We have not even defined intelligence properly, how can we define artificial intelligence then? Machine learning sounds more intuitive to me since we usually try to model a probability distribution in the best way we can. The machine literally learns the distribution in a defined model.

computer vision is a branch of AI though. but the rest is true, it can maybe detect humans sitting (not just politicians) and hands + rectangle-shaped objects, but hardly anything more. I would be more interested in developing an eye-tracking model for the politicians' eyesight, which I think would be much more informative as to what is actually happening in their minds. At least, it would prove that they focus on the bottom of their female colleagues much more than they care to admit, which would be a good point to start a discussion on how to replace them with recommender systems for public policies.

I think it's not facial recognition, because the seats are allocated to politicians on a permanent basis and the cameras are likely to have a static position and orientation. therefore it is sufficient to determine if a human is present where they are expected to be, to know that politician X is sitting on that chair

That 0.1% reduction in the error rate, I'd consider a 100% improvement.

Which, when, true (that it was a rediscovery and they hadn't been aware of the prior work) isn't even necessarily the researcher's fault. That's more on the hands of the reviewers. Different sub-field use different terminology. It's so easy to miss something when hundreds of papers are put on arxiv every single day.

I’ve seen a similar thing recently with patenting. There’s something like 2k patents submitted to the USPTO every day, and with just over 10k employees I really doubt they have time to do a proper prior art check. In patenting though, there’s are mechanisms to reverse / alter patents after the fact. In publishing, once the paper’s out and has seen enough citations, there no incentive to make any corrections.

I think part of the problem with patents is that philosophically, I think they're more inclined to make that sort of thing the problem of the involved parties to figure out post-hoc through lawsuits if they care enough. Does the USPTO frequently reject patents because of existing prior art discovered by the independent research of the approving patent officer? I suspect that sort of rejection is rare, and probably usually comes from external parties issuing complaints to the process. But I don't really know much about patents. Interested if someone with experience here could chime in.

Also, implementation matters a lot, especially in an empirical science such as AI. Some ideas turn out to be good, some don't.  If credit should be assigned to the idea, so why bother to spend months on the implementation?

 Which, when, true (that it was a rediscovery and they hadn't been aware of the prior work) isn't even necessarily the researcher's fault.   Or even necessarily the proper thing for the researcher to do. Researchers should cite the work they directly depend on.

yeah - It's the quantity over quality issue.  Lab's are expected to publish frequently, and so it's actually a huge disadvantage to go after really difficult problems and take the time and effort to advance the field.  You can go after low hanging fruit, and get a resume that gets you future jobs/grants.  Or you can take a moonshot and if you miss you basically have to leave the field because your CV won't have enough papers.

It's the longstanding downside to "publish or perish". Find the best seed, make unreproducible claims, and compare it to the worst baseline model. There is so much pressure to show positive results there is a huge publication bias type problem in the industry. Hell, a decade ago we just added more research participants until we got statistical significance, then threw those numbers into our paper and send it off. "Do the results mean anything though?" earns you a slap on the wrist

 Hell, a decade ago we just added more research participants until we got statistical significance, then threw those numbers into our paper and send it off.   That would actually lead you to a (probable) verifiable result though. I think it'd be more accurate to say: keep trying new pilot experiments until something reaches threshold significance or just above whatever metric is deemed relevant. Aka machine learning p-hacking. And if you're really desperate, automate the entire endeavor by grid searching over hyperparameters. Now you've also got a separate methods paper as well.

I agree. The easiest way to get out of this is join a good lab. Better advisor, better peer group and you work on rewarding research. Now there are usually 2 paths to this (1) You either end up in the same school as the lab (most US/European undergrads -> MS/PhD) and you already have a good rapport with the advisors, (2) or end up working hard af to get an MS or a PhD (like most immigrants).  I felt the effort to get into a top school wasn't worth it after seeing my peers and seniors put so much effort.  I know a guy who worked as a masters graduate for 2 years getting paid 1/15th the salary of a normal software grad to get a couple of papers in CVPR. He's in VGG now at Oxford doing a PhD (so good for him), but thats such a hard fucking path with so much sacrifice.  Life is more than research. And you need a decent amount of capital to actually experience these things and do what you want.

I'm sure there's more to that, but 1% improvement when the best model is already at 97%, in some industries can be the difference between applicable and not applicable, the difference between "Hey that's neat!" to "We can use that!". And that's not even talking about the iterative nature of improvement, you're disillusioned with the scientific process as a whole it seems

Ah 1% improvement in an experiment does  not have to result in 1% in the real world. Those are not the kind of improvements industries with that requirements are looking for. 1% is mostly meaningless without confidence / robust error modelling in these settings.

33% fewer errors is a significant advancement. However the question is whether it's 33% on only this specific testset, or in general

"97%, in some industries can be the difference between applicable and not applicable, the difference between "Hey that's neat!" to "We can use that!" -> What industry? What applications? Do give examples. After 95% nothing really matters. I know because I've worked on, at and with a lot of ML startups and applications with clients. 95-99%? Now that's a good jump. Maybe not so much practically (clients usually don't care) but it shows you're the best.  "You're disillusioned with the scientific process as a whole it seems" Hmm not exactly. There was a point I was really into research and experimentation but quickly realized I don't have the patience (to wait a few years). I like things that move faster.

I mean if that means 98% to 99% you have just cut the number of incorrect predictions you’ll make in half, that’s kinda something.

The transformer paper was an important step, but it's still a natural one given the preceding work on attention. LSTMs feel similar, but it's hard to comment now on the research landscape in the early days of Rnns. GANs also didn't happen in a vacuum,  VAEs were already around and share some structure. Of course all of these are still important papers, my point is that there was a sequence of work building up to each of these.

If you're not afraid of scripting, I highly recommend using LaTeX, it takes care of all the boring stuff, like formatting, naming/referencing figures, organizing citations, etc... There's a bit of a learning curve but it's really worth it. Here's a tutorial but there are tons of other resources https://latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/

Define where you want to publish and get an appropriate LaTeX template from the editor. You will need a few weeks to learn the basics but it is super robust. Different journals have different standards. If you have equations or other special formatting it is much easier. If it is only text and you are short on time stick with Word. I would also advise to work with a reference manager like Mendeley and import the papers you want to cite. Here is the scheme I teach students: 1) Write the methods section as you conduct the experiments. You will not remember all the details in six months. 2) Collect the results, finalize the main figures, write their captions, this is the main meat. If I have only 5 minutes to check a paper I will look at the first few figures. 3) Write the results section around the figures. Try to tell a story. 4) The methods sections is already mostly written. 5) Write the intro and conclusions. 6) Write the abstract, find a good title. You'd be surprised how many students start a paper with the title, then the intro, then the results, and then try to illustrate their points with figures.

I would use LyX. It's similar to LaTeX but much easier to use especially for beginners. It has a really good GUI-based equation editor. I'll probably get downvoted by the "I learnt the hard way and so should you! Only noobs take the easy route." brigade but it's genuinely better than writing equations in LaTeX. The bibliography is always the awkward part. I used to use Mendeley but they got bought by pure evil so I don't know if it's still any good.

You're going to get a lot of advice to use LaTeX, and if your paper as a lot of equations it might be useful, but otherwise I would check with your supervisors/lab before going down that road. Word can be a pain sometimes, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be, and you need something that others can read and contribute to. I wrote a lot of my PhD work in LaTeX, and while I liked it for my thesis, is was really too much work for papers that I did with others.

Word can be a pain sometimes, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be, and you need something that others can read and contribute to.

Yep. I worked at a hospital lab doing ML for neuroimaging. When your PI is a neurologist, you're probably going to use Word. With much complaining from your mathematician.  
has anyone here ever wrote a paper? I'm supposed to write one for my university and I've never wrote one before, like what tools do you use to get the pdf and what other stuff should i know?  
Latex is bad but it's better than all other alternatives that have been tried

Curious as to why you think LaTeX is bad? It has a pretty steep initial learning curve but I think overall it's a great tool.

It's not bad as in unusable, but rather there is a lot of things that could be better, and better suitable for most use cases.  Package management is awkward Syntax is often unintuitive (texttt lmao) or overly complicated for simple things It's overkill for most purposes, and does not scale down well  C is a great tool too but you wouldn't want to write your scripts in C.

I totally get what you mean, but I do not think it should be expected of PhD students to come up with anything truly novel, especially if you do a PhD straight after a Master’s degree. It is very rare that people come up with something new at this level. The lego block paper at least makes you a specialist in a given area, which can pave the way for novel discoveries in the future.

There is something to be said for applying techniques to a new field. It's not easy to go from playing Atari to folding proteins but you can definitely call it lego blocking.

To be fair, there's nothing wrong with lego blocking in general. It's lego blocking which doesn't contribute anything that's bad.  Like you said, if people lego block and it actually does something useful then it's good

Indeed. If anything, we probably need more of that. There's thousands and thousands of ideas that claim to be improvements in some way, but which have never seen any use whatsoever beyond their initial paper. There's probably way more value in figuring out which of them combine together to actually perform better (and, if possible, try to find some sort of pattern to what works and what doesn't) than in coming up with 1 additional "improvement" to add to the bottomless pile.

I see a lot of comments talking about all the short comings of ML. How there are too many people in the field, how there are not enough, too many graduate students, requirements are to strick or too lenient.  As someone who is about to enter grad school, in ML, and who is committed to the idea of being apart of this apperant broken machine. How can I be apart of the change that results in something better? Sure, read more papers, be better at research, be more creative, blah blah blah, descriptors that are easy for the experienced to understand and impossible for the young and learning to interpret.  The reason that science seems to be only nudged by the many and truly pushed by the few is because, in my opinion, success is hardly documented and faults and critism are plentiful. I think if more were willing to mentor, teach and share then we could see more progress. I know I could be better. Finally, we need a less hand wavy approach to learning how to research. The best I have learned about and getting a mentor, hoping he/she will take you under their wing and emulate as much as possible. Research shouldn't require a parent. I don't have a better solution unfortunately but i wish there was one.

The reason academia is like that (some fields better, some fields worse) is that in order to get funding you need metrics that show to any grant, university, program etc committee that you/your department performs well (or even better, outstanding). That is why 5 crap papers is better and safer (and easier to produce) than 1 outstanding work, because it will be easier to convince people that decide who gets the money (and often have no idea of the subject, even the field) with quantity compared to quality. And going for the 1 outstanding work is also very risky, no one guarantees you will get something out of it. It's always about the money, especially in fields to close to the industry, like ML.

"Towards" means there's evidence that this approach holds promise.  It doesn't mean that's the answer or the end-all-be-all.  You don't get papers like that very often in any kind of science.  With something as challenging as AGI, for example, anyone that says they know with confidence where the answer is is either lying, mistaken, or using a definition that's off the mark. "Towards a unified theory of gravitation" might be "incomplete", as you said, but that's like saying, "You only have one Michelin Star?" Or, "You only have one Nobel prize?" It's technically accurate, but feels rather pejorative to me. It's probably obvious that I'm salty, and maybe I'm taking too personally something that was offered in jest, but I hope the grievance about the use of "incomplete" isn't entirely lost.

We all have our own preferences. If "towards" doesn't bother you, that's fine but I hate it. Maybe incomplete was not the right term. Instead of towards something you don't have, then use a title for something you do have. Don't waste my time with your BS god knows there's enough of that in ML papers. Just my 2 cents please don't take it personally. =)

That is cool. However, procrastinating is a great thing to do. Most of my favorite papers and projects I've worked on come from me getting up from my desk and walking around the department looking for people to have coffee and random discussions so I don't have to work. So while maybe studying is important not to procrastinate, I have never found it detrimental in the long run.

what you are doing is more like taking a break. But here the procrastination would be like using your phone after solving 1 or 2 questions for 5-30 minutes while doing a set of 20 questions. It's possible that you might not even solve that set on the same day.

It always depends on the type and amount of procrastination. For some people, procrastination means doing something that’s more fun than their main task, but it’s still kind of productive and actually fun. For others, it means relieving pressure from work by doing something more mundane that gives you immediate gratification, like browsing Reddit. And that can be in total mind numbing and unproductive.

For work projects and for people who work 9-5 procrastination is like "what is that?" You don't even know. For personal projects where there's no boss and no deadline or any immediate real life consequences procrastination is the biggest difference in performance. And really THE ONLY difference. It goes from working on a personal project for 5 hours a day to working on a personal project for 5 min and then being distracted for the rest of the evening. I'm pretty sure most people can't really accomplish anything worthwhile 99% of it is because of procrastination. 1% is because of natural talent/intelligence.

Does anyone know how is the network detecting multiple objects at once? Can a network have variable output sizes for detecting more than one object?  
You can easily build one by fine-tuning YOLO. You can read up on this, but the way these algorithms work is by guessing a bunch of bounding boxes and predicting class probabilities for each one. It's actually very straightforward to build object detectors--all you have to do is label a few images (you can even use an online image labelling software). Check out https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 for more details--given labelled data, you can probably get a model working in under 30 minutes.

this shit is so stupid, hide the phone off camera also pretend yo wobble the pen all the time so it think youre doing something, waste of time but im sure amazon would love this , they already stick the camera to their trucks and measure how often drivers are distracted and arent thinking about their work.What a shitty use of AI.Its supposed to help people and not help to punish people by non stop checking up on them.

The robots existence is to punish its master from indulging in the same activity that created its own life.    The robot might interpret it as its own creation is a mistake, thus leading to a low self esteem and daddy issues.    Thus it's good that it makes you not procrastinate, as you will become more successful and be able to afford psychiatric help for the low self esteem issues and heal it from its existential dread.

Studying is a massive waste of time. It is glorifying the special human characteristic of being terrible at retaining information. The simple solution would be to manufacture a memory retention system within your brain that didn’t totally suck and didn’t require you to study in the first place. Should be able to simply copy the information into your head.

I agree, most of the knowledge we had to memorize is useless over lifespan, people should be specialised in one particular subject , the school system is made so everyone ould kinda fiture out his future work but it doesnt really work that well IMO.Theres a lot of things they dont teach at school for example how to deal with court case, how to use connections to find a job, how important is CV in some work enviroments, they want to milk the students for loans... oh well.Whenever somethign weird happens just lookup moneytrail and youll find the answer.

 Thirdly, there is a worshiping problem.  Thank you. I was going to make a meta-post on this topic, suggesting that the subreddit put a temporary moratorium on threads discussing individual personalities instead of their work—obvious exceptions for huge awards or deaths. We need to step back for a moment and consider whether the worship culture is healthy, especially when some of these people perpetuate the toxicity you're writing about above.

100% agreed. It irks me when really interesting research by less well-known researchers that can spark great discussion is posted on this sub and there are only 1-2 comments discussing it while at the same time a post about a random tweet by an ML celebrity garners 300-500 comments.

Part of this has to do with the growth of the sub. A few years back a much greater proportion of participants were ML specialists who knew how to identify good research in their field regardless of how well known the authors are. ML hype over time has resulted in this sub being overrun by AI celebrity gossip and news about Siraj Raval. Don't get me wrong, ML deserves a lot of the hype it's been getting, but that energy would be better spent developing new models and creating better datasets as opposed to the social media bullshit that's taken over ML's public perception today.

Very true. And I think the best way to remedy the situation is to have less of these drama posts. I have noticed that all of them are [D] posts ([R] and [P] are usually fine). Maybe [D] posts should be more heavily moderated/scrutinized to ensure they have actual substantial/technical content?

I'd also say that interesting research requires significantly more effort to engage with than a simple tweet.

Counterpoint: Reddit is just not good for serious research discussion due to the inherent popularity contest with up/downvotes. I get my research news from twitter, I just come here for the drama and the (very occasional) super hyped research.  
 It used to be that science was embedded inside Western liberalism ideals of "nothing is absolutely correct everything is possible", but in recent times it has increasingly become binary, concentrated on "if you're not right you're wrong". Applies not just to science but many other things.  There is no "used to be". These are problems that have always existed across all fields. It is human psychology. We only perceive that those problems didn't exist in the past because of various biases.  
That’s only half true. Most fields of science could be covered in a single textbook for a long time (of course writing that textbook wasn’t easy!). The sheer number of researchers currently make us prone to a whole new group of fallacies. For example, most no longer take the time to sit down and personally evaluate what others do, and this shapes the landscape. Also, publish or perish is decidedly something that arose in the later part of the 20th century. And so on.

I don't deny that there is a worshipping problem, but I'd like to offer yet another hypothesis for why papers from Google/DeepMind/etc are getting more attention: Trust. With such a huge number of papers every week, it's impossible to read them all. Using pedigree is one way to filter, and while it's biased and unfair, it's not a bad one. Researchers at DeepMind are not any more talented than elsewhere, but they take on more risk. When DeepMind publishes a paper, it stakes its reputations on its validity. If the results turned out to be a fluke it would reflect badly on the whole company, leading to bad press and a loss of reputation. Thus it's likely that papers from these organizations go through a stricter "quality control" process and internal peer review before they get published. I am guilty of this myself. I regularly read through the titles of new arXiv submissions. When I see something interesting, I look at the authors. If it's DeepMind/Google/OpenAI/etc I take a closer look. If it's a group of authors from a place I've never heard off, I stop reading. Why? Because in my mind, the latter group of authors is more likely to "make up stuff" and have their mistakes go unnoticed because they didn't go through the same internal quality control that a DeepMind paper would. There's a higher probability that I'm reading something that's just wrong. This has nothing to do with me worshipping DeepMind, I just trust its papers more due to the way the system works. Is what I'm doing wrong? Yes, it clearly is. I shouldn't look at the authors at all. It should be about the content. But there are just too many papers and I don't want to risk wasting my time.

I agree with the first two paragraphs, but the way you do research is probably quite different then what I do. There might be really good ideas, comparisons, notation, etc. you cannot afford to miss in these random arxive papers. So, I try to skim as much papers as I can and not read the author names or institution, citing and taking everything useful into my work.

I don't doubt that pedigree is one of the less-bad metrics to use when faced with such an onslaught of literature but I question whether Deepmind/Google/wherever are less likely to make stuff up than a group from a less prestigious institution. The big boys know that they can fart out any old nonsense and loads of people will respond with "OMG deepmind made a publish they're so great" while a less-known group don't have that luxury.

i heavily disagree with this. The size of the group and well-know-status is heavily influenced by the type of research it is doing. place matters too, but there are non-hype topics in ML and groups that specialize on that typically are smaller. And of course they have a more difficult time to get stuff published. Because the name matters to the AC. in my experience some of the highest quality papers are no-name research groups. On the other hand, i got used to the fact that some of the articles by high quality groups are so ambiguously and unscientifically written that it is impossible to understand what they are doing without the code. I remember times where we wanted to reproduce a result of a paper and it took us forever to find the permutation of algorithmic interpretations that actually worked.  
 Thirdly, there is a worshiping problem.  Thank you.

I would really like this and would support such a measure! I think the idea is great and you should create such a meta-post.  
[D] The machine learning community has a toxicity problem
We actually wrote a paper regarding some of the above points. Kind of a self-criticism: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07633 Some other points we touched: "lack of hypothesis" & "chronic allergy to negative results"  And we discussed (without claiming always applicable) the possibility of results-blind peer review process.

 chronic allergy to negative results  As someone who just finished a graduation thesis this month about a noise-attenuation neural network (autoencoder) applied to microcontrollers... My results couldn't have been more negative, quite literally, and yet I am still presenting it based on the fact that it is also worthwhile to publish negative results, fully knowing it won't have that much appreciation. And yet, to my surprise, my negative results were celebrated by the council. I am very confident of the value my work brings to the world yet I just had this idea that people supposed to evaluate my work would just not get it when I told them that I exhausted every possibility of trying to make something work and yet it didn't and all I have to prove is "don't do what I tried because it doesn't work no matter the configuration".  Universities and professors should dedicate more time to let students and future PhDs know that proving something doesn't work is just as important to the world as the opposite. Thankfully I think this is becoming more self-evident as time progresses.

On the other hand, proving that something doesn't work (properly) is so much more work than proving that something does work. I think we should definitely appreciate negative results more, though.

Negative result is also a result, that's what my professors encouraged too.  And i think, at Springer joirnals or somewhere else, to counter this "allergy" they introduced the format of "research report". Which is essentially "we tried this, here's the outcome". So both positive and negative results should be equal, because you do not report on the "new effect discovered", you just report on input-methods-output. I really hope this becomes a more prevalent format for scientific publications.

Neither positive nor negative results should be published behind a Springer paywall though.

To me negative results are often far more interesting than positives one, when I have an idea, I try to find a related work on scholar and if I prefer to find a paper with a negative result rather than no paper and lost time with a bad idea. But, the problem with "negative" paper, is that you don't get much citation. As literature review and related work section, tend to only cite previous SOTA results. The only way to get citation for a negative result is if someone tweak your approach and makes it works which is a huge bet and can be seen by some as "pejorative citation" even if it is not. IMHO, literature review paper should cite more "negative result" papers.

Thankfully I think this is becoming more self-evident as time progresses.  
 And yet, to my surprise, my negative results were celebrated by the council.  ...as they should (assuming you evaluated and documented everything properly). Being able to recognize that your original hypothesis is likely to be incorrect requires intellectual honesty, which is an essential characteristic for a good scientist/engineer. Unfortunately, these days, presenting negative results also requires some level of courage, so... kudos for that.  
 chronic allergy to negative results  As someone who just finished a graduation thesis this month about a noise-attenuation neural network (autoencoder) applied to microcontrollers... My results couldn't have been more negative, quite literally, and yet I am still presenting it based on the fact that it is also worthwhile to publish negative results, fully knowing it won't have that much appreciation.

We actually wrote a paper regarding some of the above points. Kind of a self-criticism: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07633 Some other points we touched: "lack of hypothesis" & "chronic allergy to negative results"  And we discussed (without claiming always applicable) the possibility of results-blind peer review process.  
No authors from google or deepmind. Not worth reading.  /s

I loved the synflow paper exactly for not being this (it lays down a hypothesis, shows the results, makes a prediction and shows it pans out) but ironically all the authors in that paper where not in ML departments

Thanks for writing this. I can strongly attest the 'publish or perish' mentality. In my experience, ML researchers seem to live on an entirely different planet revolving around NeurIPS and/or CVPR. The first thing a guy I had to work with on a project asked me was the acceptance rate of the conferences I publish at. I am not even a ML researcher. Entirely ridiculous. Most of them truly have a huge superiority complex they should address.

Some of these are rampant in academia in general, what hasn't happened elsewhere is the spotlight (and $$$) that has been thrown at CS/ML in past few years.  We see what fame/fortune does to a lot of people (outside academia) we are not immune to the lesser parts of human behavior.

We see what fame/fortune does to a lot of people (outside academia) we are not immune to the lesser parts of human behavior.  Just posted some data on some of the problems in academia: Graphs of parental incomes of Harvard's student body: http://harvardmagazine.com/2017/01/low-income-students-harvard https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/harvard-university Who benefits from discriminatory college admissions policies? the advantage of having a well-connected relative. At the University of Texas at Austin, an investigation found that recommendations from state legislators and other influential people helped underqualified students gain acceptance to the school. This is the same school that had to defend its affirmative action program for racial minorities before the U.S. Supreme Court. And those de facto advantages run deep. Beyond legacy and connections, consider good old money. “The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges — and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates,” by Daniel Golden, details how the son of former Sen. Bill Frist was accepted at Princeton after his family donated millions of dollars. Businessman Robert Bass gave $25 million to Stanford University, which then accepted his daughter. And Jared Kushner’s father pledged $2.5 million to Harvard University, which then accepted the student who would become Trump’s son-in-law and advisor. Selective colleges’ hunger for athletes also benefits white applicants above other groups. Those include students whose sports are crew, fencing, squash and sailing, sports that aren’t offered at public high schools. The thousands of dollars in private training is far beyond the reach of the working class. And once admitted, they generally under-perform, getting lower grades than other students, according to a 2016 report titled “True Merit” by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. “Moreover,” the report says, “the popular notion that recruited athletes tend to come from minority and indigent families turns out to be just false; at least among the highly selective institutions, the vast bulk of recruited athletes are in sports that are rarely available to low-income, particularly urban schools.” Any investigation should be ready to find that white students are not the most put-upon group when it comes to race-based admissions policies. That title probably belongs to Asian American students who, because so many of them are stellar achievers academically, have often had to jump through higher hoops than any other students in order to gain admission. Here's another group, less well known, that has benefited from preferential admission policies: men. There are more qualified college applications from women, who generally get higher grades and account for more than 70% of the valedictorians nationwide. Seeking to create some level of gender balance, many colleges accept a higher percentage of the applications they receive from males than from females. http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-affirmative-action-investigation-trump-20170802-story.html "Meritocracy": White Americans' anti-affirmative action opinions dramatically change  when shown that Asian-American students would qualify more in  admissions because of their better test scores and fewer white students  would get in for just being white. At that point, when they believe whites will benefit from  affirmative action compared to Asian-Americans, white Americans say that  using race and affirmative action should be a factor and is fair and the right thing to do:  Indeed, the degree to which white people emphasized merit for college  admissions changed depending on the racial minority group, and whether  they believed test scores alone would still give them an upper hand  against a particular racial minority.As a result, the study suggests that the emphasis on merit has less  to do with people of color's abilities and more to do with how white  people strategically manage threats to their position of power from  nonwhite groups. http://www.vox.com/2016/5/22/11704756/affirmative-action-merit  Also, Asians are somehow treated as more privileged than white Americans:  white applicants were three times more likely to be admitted to selective schools than Asian applicants with the exact same academic record. Additionally, affirmative action will not do away with legacy admissions that are more likely available to white applicants.  "Legacy admissions": The majority of Asian-Americans grow up with first-generation  immigrant parents whose English (and wealth) don't give them the same  advantages as "privileged," let alone what's called "legacy" Stanford's acceptance rate is 5.1% … if either of your parents went to Stanford, this triples for you In any other circumstance, this would be considered bribery. But when rich alumni do it, it’s allowed. In fact, it’s tax-subsidized. Worse, this “affirmative action for the rich” is paid for by everyone else. As non-profits, these elite universities – and their enormous, hedge fund-esque endowments – are mostly untaxed. Both private and public universities that use legacy admissions are additionally subsidized through student aid programs, research grants, and other sources of federal and state money. In addition, as Elizabeth Stoker and Matt Bruenig explain, alumni donations to these schools are also not taxed and therefore subsidized by the general population. They write, “The vast majority of parents do not benefit from the donation-legacy system. Yet these parents are forced, through the tax code, to help fund alumni donations against their own children’s chances of admission to the elite institutions they may otherwise be well qualified for.” If legacy preference “shows a respect for tradition,” as supporters of the practice argue, that tradition is inherited aristocracy and undeserved gains. It is fundamentally against the notion of universities as “great equalizers.” It promotes those who already have wealth and power and diminishes those who do not. It subsidizes the wealthy to line the coffers of the richest universities. In other words – elite education is predominantly for the rich. And because these institutions disproportionately serve as feeders for positions of wealth, power, and influence, they perpetuate existing social and income disparities. Yet these schools ardently try to claim that they are instead tools for social mobility and equalization. You cannot have your cake, eat it too, and then accept its cupcakes through legacy admissions. Children of alumni already have an incredible built-in advantage merely by being the children of college graduates from elite universities. They are much more likely to grow up wealthy, get a good education, and have access to the resources and networks at the top of the social, economic, and political ladders. Legacy admission thus gives them an added advantage on top of all of this, rewarding those who already have a leg up at the expense of those who do not have the same backgrounds. William Bowen, Martin Kurzweil, and Eugene Tobin put it more succinctly: “Legacy preferences serve to reproduce the high-income/high-education/white profile that is characteristic of these schools.” Right now we have the worst of both worlds. We have a profoundly unfair system masquerading as a meritocracy. If we are going to continue to subsidize elite schools and allow them to have the outsize impact that they currently do on our national economic, political, and social institutions, we need to start to chip away at the fundamental imbalances in the system. Step one: Get rid of legacy preference in admissions. https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshfreedman/2013/11/14/the-farce-of-meritocracy-in-elite-higher-education-why-legacy-admissions-might-be-a-good-thing/, https://blog.collegevine.com/legacy-demystified-how-the-people-you-know-affect-your-admissions-decision/, https://twitter.com/xc/status/892861426074664960

Thank you very much, this is so rare voice in these circles. "Diversity & inclusion" mantra almost completely abandoned people from poor backgrounds or simply less educated families. The rate of stigma and rejection you get in academia, being from "lower" part of society, can be insane.

I agree it's common but it definitely shouldn't be the norm. It's probably a large reason why PhD students are so stressed during those 4 years.

Are data scientists or software devs less stressed? Going by rate of online complaints, it seems similar. They say it's always tight deployment deadlines, technical debt, clueless non-technical managers, overtime culture, everything is always on fire etc. They look at academic research as a heaven where you set flexible hours, can spend a week diving in a math textbook or a new topic, you work on your own research project and ideas, your manager is a professor in your field not some MBA, etc. etc. I'm saying this as a stressed PhD student, but I think people are biased to imagine the grass is so green on the other side. Competition in general creates stress, and you have competition in corporate industry careers as much as in academic research.

I am sure these issues exist everywhere. But it seems in industry at least you come right out as being motivated to churn out more sales or profits, being the power hungry leader, so on and so forth whereas in academia you put yourself on a high pedestal as to being morally superior because of your work for the "greater good" (despite holding grudges for your competitors, power-plays against your competitors in "blind"-reviews, possessing the same qualities as managers in industry). Let's all be honest and accept presence of toxic people in all walks of life.

Let's all be honest and accept presence of toxic people in all walks of life.  
"We Didn't Start the Fire" It seems to me that this may be more a factor of growing up. In another discussion elsewhere someone argued that the young adults who freak out about the state of the world (everything is going down the drain! Syria! China! Trump! Crimea! Covid! Brexit! Social media!), they are just growing up and noticing the world around them. It has over been like this. When I was a kid, there was war in Yugoslavia, before that there was a Cold War, dictatorships in Eastern Europe, in my grandparents' time it was actual war and cities flattened to ground. By analogy, when people come out of school, they are bright eyed and naive, especially if they grew up in a protected environment. Whether you go to industry or academia, you meet the real world the first time. Now it's not about fake grades, but real status, wealth, respect. You are now a full adult and have to compete. And you notice that this involves politics and that people often compromise on the ideals that you had in your mind as a naive student. It's a good opportunity to dive into philosophy (not the modern mathy kind, but the "what is the good life" kind, what to value, how to set up our lives). Growing up is stressful. But anyone who tells me that life as a PhD student is so bad just doesn't have a big perspective on life. It's a bit like a post I read the other day, where a guy was lamenting that their life is practically over if they don't get accepted to MIT/Stanford/... Seriously, you will do fine, having CS and ML skills that keep you afloat in a PhD program means you probably won't have problems with getting jobs or living an upper middle class life. Compare it to the natural sciences, where PhD students are often not even fully funded, or they work on projects most of the time and research in their free time. It's crazy, but there is no funding. In comparison, industry is pumping loads of money into CS. If you work in a richer country, you can go to various summer schools (free vacation essentially), where you're fed highest quality free food, can see a great location, meet famous people etc. Similarly with conferences, that are deliberately in places like Hawaii etc. Now if you work in a poorer country they can of course not afford this for sure, but I don't think it's only those people complaining.  
I agree it's common but it definitely shouldn't be the norm. It's probably a large reason why PhD students are so stressed during those 4 years.  
I fucking despise the supposedly blind peer review. I say supposedly because the editor in the middle knows the parties involved. I'm jumping into industry once I have my PhD. (Applied math: stochastic optimization, not machine learning).  
I agree it's common but it definitely shouldn't be the norm. It's probably a large reason why PhD students are so stressed during those 4 years.  
and also why they quit academia once they are done.

 Thirdly, there is a worshiping problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper.  I totally agree with the premise... but, I think a lot of people forget just how easy it was to load up BERT and take it for a spin. The effort the authors put into the usability of the model helped immensely.

Not only this, but by most metrics, BERT showed much better results than ULMfit, in a practical sense (wider sets of results against more applicable/watched tasks, some basically-SOTA). There is a (IMO, I would argue, appropriately) big bump in citations for 1) showing that something can work really well and 2) showing that it has broad applicability.

TLDR; politics sucks. Unfortunately, you can never escape politics, no matter which field you escape to. I started doing scientific research because I imagined the system to be a fair meritocracy. It's science after all. If you don't like politics, academia is one of the worst places to be. This is the sad truth. This is not a recent phenomenon, and it's not just ML. It has always been this way. It's just more visible now because more people are new to the field and surprised that it's not what they expected. As long as the academic system functions the way it does and is protected by gatekeepers and institutions with perverse incentives, this will never change. What can you do? Lead by example. Don't play the game and exit the system. Do independent research. Do something else. Don't be driven by your ego that tells you to compete with other academics and publish more papers. Do real stuff. It's very difficult to reform a system from within. Reform comes when enough people decide to completely exit a system and build an alternative that has a critical mass.

YES, a thousand times YES. The current situation is a bad one and you can hardly expect to solve real problems with the research process of today. I forcefully went independent after my PhD lost funding. I completely burned out and with all sorts of psychological damage -- maybe the best thing that happened to me because it got me out of hell. I can research real problems now not being pressured just to write papers, albeit it's harder without any community. Not that I had an active advisor or other staff to help. Another thing I have a problem understanding is why such intelligent people tolerate this bullshit. It would be very easy to reform the entire research process with the skills and knowledge this community has.

Money and fame. Almost all of what you describe comes from newer people who want fame (cite me!) more than advances in science. It's because with the (somewhat justified) hype around ML in the industry, fame turns you into a millionaire. Just wait until there is no longer money falling from the sky in this field, and all those toxic persons will simply vanish like a gradient in an MLP too deep. With them, the factual problems with reviews and reproducibility will also vanish, and things will be enjoyable and rigorous again.

Wow, this post is making me seriously rethink applying for an ML graduate program.  
Wow, this post is making me seriously rethink applying for an ML graduate program.  
There are a lot of very closely related fields that are a lot less competitive. Indeed in my department I think anyone would be way better off not being in one of the big ML groups, and working under another advisor with a smaller group (not too small though because that means the prof is hard to work with or doesn’t have enough money). My impression is that these giant groups are miserable to work in, highly competitive even within a competitive grad program, and run by senior grad students or post docs so you won’t even get to work with the “famous” prof, it’s just a nice line on your resume. But many advisors not in ML would be happy for their students to apply ML to their research, so there is really no need to be in one of those groups unless you feel it is really important to you. You should try to find an advisor that is willing to let you explore your interests, easy to work with, and has the time and money to support you. When you do campus visits, the most important thing is asking students in different groups how happy they are with their advisor.  TL;DR don’t choose a famous ML advisor/at least know what you’re getting into. But work on ML anyway if it interests you.

Indeed in my department I think anyone would be way better off not being in one of the big ML groups, and working under another advisor with a smaller group (not too small though because that means the prof is hard to work with or doesn’t have enough money). My impression is that these giant groups are miserable to work in, highly competitive even within a competitive grad program, and run by senior grad students or post docs so you won’t even get to work with the “famous” prof, it’s just a nice line on your resume. But many advisors not in ML would be happy for their students to apply ML to their research, so there is really no need to be in one of those groups unless you feel it is really important to you. You should try to find an advisor that is willing to let you explore your interests, easy to work with, and has the time and money to support you. When you do campus visits, the most important thing is asking students in different groups how happy they are with their advisor.

When you say closely related do you mean an ML subset like CV, NLP, or do you mean something like Electrical Engineering or Statstics which can have heavily overlapping subject matter depending on the area of interest?

 Electrical Engineering or Statistics  lol, the best theoretical ML research comes out of these departments

Well, traditional ML is a lot of signal processing and statstics isn’t it? I don’t know enough about DL to speak intelligently on the matter.

Yes the latter. I’m in the Electrical Engineering + CS department, but on the EE side.

 TL;DR don’t choose a famous ML advisor/at least know what you’re getting into.  There are some famous advisors that do have labs with a nice work environment and do take time for their students as well. I'm not sure if this can be taken as a rule, being famous is not really a defining characteristic.  
Wow, this post is making me seriously rethink applying for an ML graduate program.  
I wouldn't let that scare you away. Working in ML is still greatly rewarding. And, I will say, most of the negatives you're seeing listed here are either limited mostly to academia (i.e. not a long-term factor if you plan to enter industry) or only really applicable to the 1% of the ML community with respect to notoriety.

Yes this is just crazy how hard the ML community manages to clash and tear itself apart regularly.  I follow both the physics community and the ML community and it’s quite hard to imagine physicists trash talking this hard and politicizing every aspect of their research. Ok ML has social influences but this is just ridiculous to see people pushing their political beliefs through their research ... Concerning reproducibility and the race to publish I think it’s simply because ML is extremely competitive with regard to other fields (physics for example).

Probably the parts that has to do with big collaborations. I'm currently on one of those, and there's a heavy incentive to not misbehave since no one would work with you otherwise, and that's almost always a death sentence since you'll never not need help working on a big collaboration. I have seen those behaviors from smaller labs and more independent researchers though. Thankfully the field is moving on the right track as older professors retire, for some reasons.

I'm also on a big collaboration and there is drama/politics of course, it just doesn't happen in public/on twitter. But leadership often does try to keep everyone happy (even to the slight detriment of the science sometimes).

Not sure I entirely agree re physics. Physicists are opinionated as much as anyone & go pretty hard. Just browse Sabine Hossenfelder's blog as an example. Same with mathematicians, logicians, philosophers, etc. Doesn't really make sense to compare fields like this imo.

Sabine is a suuuuuuper edge case though, she has strong opinions about everything and will always fight people for it. It's probably more helpful to look at the average phycisist, although I have no idea how you would even go about that other than anecdotal evidence. But overall I'd say the field is less politicized and more concerned with petty drama, if only for the fact that the majority of physics is detached from most of real life.

Albert Einstein was absolutely not opposed to quantum mechanics, by any stretch of the imagination. Saying Einstein was opposed to QM is like saying Alan Turing was against computers; Einstein was one of the founding fathers of QM. What Einstein took issue with, was the Copenhagen interpretation of QM.  Many/most physicist working in foundational QM today share his view on that.

Eh, while Einstein was instrumental to QM it is certainly not any stretch of the imagination to say he considered it incomplete and very dissatisfying at the time. And while part of it was the Copenhagen interpretation, his major reservations to my understanding were to do with the major implications of QM - that uncertainty and probability were fundamental properties of the universe as opposed to a properties of an observer. Hence his attempts at formulating a Hidden Variable theory.  The notion of hidden variables (in certain situations) were dismissed as impossible in a paper by Bell in 1964 and were thus dismissed by the community at large. Afaik, this is still the case, and in fact most researchers still don’t share Einstein’s views in that regard. (The Copenhagen interpretation is a different matter, but that too is/was the primary QM interpretation for Einstein’s entire life and much after it)

This. I also read that Schrödinger too was against the idea that an electron can be in more than one state, probablistically at a time. He proposed his hypothetical cat experiment to prove the absurdity in the Copenhagen interpretation. Ironically, it is used today to explain the probabilistic nature in QM. I might be wrong. Read that sometime back.

The focus on quantity over quality is a big one. We should be focusing on quality research instead of trying to increase our publication count. Also, the focus on just throwing more data at larger models like GPT-3 is a super bad direction for the field to be going in. Rather than actual innovation it's just larger models and more data and making things even more exclusive to the large companies and labs with 1000s of GPUs and tons of funding and resources.

 papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection.  Wait, can someone provide an example of this?  
Well, for both this and /u/manganime1's question, you can take a look at http://horace.io/OpenReviewExplorer/ There were 9 papers at ICLR rejected with a (6,6,8):  such as https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJlDDnVKwS, https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxJO3VFwB, https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxeThNFPH Some papers that were accepted with extremely low scores:  (1,3,3): https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg76kStwH (6,1,3): https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1emfT4twB  
The rationale for the acceptance of these papers with low score was the response of the authors and the lack of further response from the reviewers. The Area Chair considered the authors' responses satisfactory and that the reviewers would increase their rating if they were to read those responses. Moreover, none of these were from Google, DeepMind, Facebook, Stanford or other mentioned institutions. I recommend that people check out the reviews of these rejected papers and arrive at their own conclusions, but from what I read the Area Chair decisions seemed reasonable.

I actually thought that was great to see. The authors addressed the comments in the rebuttal, fairly answered all the reviewers points and even demonstrated that their paper was novel and the reviewers didn't bother to reply/change score. Good on them for getting accepted.

 https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxeThNFPH  I wonder what people think about this one. The authors seem to be from Google and Facebook which according to the OP post should grant acceptance.  However judging by reviews the meta-reviewer gets two weak accepts and one accept from a person who doesn't know much about this area, so AC writes a strong reject review and ultimately rejects the paper. Makes total sense from a perspective of a highly competitive program, but looks totally shady on the surface

Back in 2017, NIPS rejected a quite novel approach to language modeling that I had implemented and found quite effective. (Not my paper.) NIPS accepted essentially every NLP paper that came out of FAIR or DeepMind, even those that claimed only trivial improvements that were attributable to grid search, and those that were obviously grossly exaggerating their accomplishments.  Reading the reviewer comments, I couldn’t help shaking the feeling that what was going on, was that the anonymous reviewers worked for the same companies and were just helping out their buddies.  That was one of the events that led me to get out of NLP AI research.

 If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a loser  No, that's not true. You're only expected to publish 5+ papers every year in your 4th / 5th year Ph.D! Before then, you're only expected to publish 2-3 papers a year, and before Ph.D as undergrad or masters you only need 1-2!

It is mainly sarcasm, but there is a hint of truth :/ To be competitive as a grad school applicant these days, you almost certainly need to be published in a competitive conference. I know one lab that filters out their applications by number of first-author publications in Neurips / ICML / ICLR. I think that's the most extreme example, but most labs do filter by the number of publications (doesn't have to be first author) and recommendation letters. And for PhD students, the bar for being "good" is 2-3 papers in top tier conferences a year. My experience is only from being an undergrad and PhD student in a competitive academic setting in the US, so these expectations may vary.

Can vouch for this. Many first author ICML/NeurIPS not even getting an interview at top schools

How do you propose to evaluate people? Because it's physically impossible to get a place for everyone under Hinton or Jitendra Malik. There needs to be some selection. There are too many people with publications for all of them to be at a top lab.

My sarcasm detection model outputted a probability of 92.826% that it’s sarcastic

Depends on the group! The standard in our lab in Germany is 3 good conference papers over the whole of the PhD, which empirically takes between 4 and 6 years. Applicants usually come without publications or with one publication based on their master thesis. But we're also not a world famous hypercompetitive group. And that also means you have no jetpack names attached to your papers, so getting seen is difficult.  
That's an insane amount of papers...   I want to believe this is sarcasm.  
I think it's more facetious in tone than in substance. It really is hard to get into a good Ph.D. program without multiple top-tier publications in undergrad and/or master's.  
 If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a loser  No, that's not true. You're only expected to publish 5+ papers every year in your 4th / 5th year Ph.D! Before then, you're only expected to publish 2-3 papers a year, and before Ph.D as undergrad or masters you only need 1-2!  
What is also disheartening is that future applicants such as myself who work in theory, as opposed to applications, don't stand a good chance in a unified pool. For instance, in a field such as deep RL, where papers are practically published any time you observe "an improvement", you can't compete up with that amount of throughput. This is just my opinion.

I don't think LeCun was insensitive. I think he was painted insensitive after the fact, but what I saw was him taking a stance, documenting it, being personally attacked without any reply to his arguments, and then dismissed with "if you aren't a black woman you have no right to talk", which is ridiculous. What's doubly annoying is that I wanted to see a counterpoint to LeCun's arguments, because I wanted to learn more about what the problem is and see what it was he was missing, but the counterargument was "you aren't black so you're wrong". I left that debate thinking LeCun was right and that some people do the racial struggle a disservice by being entitled and trying to blame racism for anything they don't like to hear.

This stuff is almost directly related to the size of the field. I started in the speech recognition field when it was a sleepy niche field. The conferences were collegial, people knew each other and their various pet projects. The moment speech recognition became commercially viable, the conferences drastically changed.  The big guns swooped in and entirely dominated the conferences, the papers had the same problems OP described, with little scientific value, just gaming the process to get a higher number nobody could produce.

 Secondly, there is a reproducibility crisis.  I am working on 3D Pose Estimation and I really feel this problem right now! There aren't that many datasets and most papers use the dataset "Human3.6M". Its large, but also very specific. So many projects tweak the "postprocessing" so that they account the specific setup of Human3.6M ... and so my results on "free living samples" are worse.

Btw, this race to publish strongly encourages publication with few experimental soundness and that don't improve on nothing but rather are just telling a story that is sound ( unfortunately sound stories rarely are able to justify deep learning successes ). Then verify it by few experiments obviously discarding any of them that would disprove the initial claim ... I feel like I spent one year reading such papers to realize the field I'm working on has not advanced an inch ... Then you obviously see papers like 'reality checks' to denounce that, but still more useless paper are coming out every day.

Forgive me for being new. But what is this obsession with releasing new papers? Is papers seen as some way to get a salary or something? If you really wanted to do AI research, would it not be better to be payed by a private company?

Firstly, welcome. Writing papers is not exclusive to academia. To cite an example described here, the original BERT paper was written and published by Google employees. To answer your question directly, historically (or perhaps ideally), writing papers and publishing them has been seen as a way to contribute to a collective body of knowledge, thereby advancing the state of the art. The number of papers published by an author was seen as a proxy measure for their influence on the field. However, over the last few decades (I think? could go back further- I'm only a few decades old myself), research institutions started using that metric to measure professional performance among professors. Employers started using it to measure the bona fides of job applicants. Folks started looking at a private institutions' publishing record as a measure of legitimacy and prestige. And, unsurprisingly, this contaminated the incentive structure. To be clear, this "publish or perish" culture is a known issue in academia more broadly, and is not restricted to our domain.

Thank you very much for that explanation. This kind of "publish or perish" culture seems dangerous. What prevents somebody from writing a fake paper? If the research cannot be reproduced entirely from a 3rd party by the paper, then anyone could publish something that is yet not achieved and take credit?

Any reputable journal will subject all submissions to a process known as "peer review." An editor reviews the submission, then either rejects it or passes it along to other researchers in the relevant discipline who submit feedback to the editor. The editor then either rejects the paper, sends it back to the author for revision, or accepts it for publication. Part of the process that follows is the reproduction of results by other folks in the industry. Note that this is something that is contentious in our field, as it can be difficult to exactly reproduce results which may rely on some (quasi)stochastic (i.e. random) process, or on highly-specified initial conditions (the hyperparameter tuning mentioned above). However, if nobody can even come close to replicating your results, then there's a problem. This is also true in other fields. Taken together, peer review and reproducibility have historically done a fairly decent job of maintaining a generally acceptable standard of quality in publishing. Don't get me wrong, there are still lots of problems, and not even mentioned here is the paywall issue (paying massive fees for journal subscriptions just to see the research), but on the whole this has been the process, and it's gotten us pretty far.

Most papers are never reimplemented by anyone. I heard from several colleagues that they suspect fishy stuff in some papers as the results seem too good, and their reimplementation doesn't get close to the published results. Contacting the authors usually results in nothing substantial. Sometimes people do release code, but that code itself cannot reproduce the paper results. Then if someone complains, Github issues often get closed with no substantial answer. There is no place to go to complain, other than starting a major conflict with the professor on the paper, who may also not respond. Sure this is not a good way to build a reputation, but many are not in this for the long run. You publish a few papers with fishy results, you get your degree and go to industry. You don't really have a long-term reputation. There are tons and tons of papers out there. Thousands and thousands of PhD students. Even those few that get reimplemented don't get so much attention that anyone would care about a blog post bashing that result. What option do you have? You suspect the numbers were fabricated, but have to beat the benchmark to publish. Do you put an asterisk after their result in your table and say you suspect it's fake? Do you write the conference chairs / proceedings publisher? In theory you could resolve this with the authors, but again, they are often utterly unresponsive or get very defensive. Also, many peer-reviewed papers lie about the state-of-the-art. They simply skip the best prior works from their tables. Literally. In informal conversations at conferences I also heard from several people that some of they realized later that some of their earlier papers had evaluation flaws that inflated their score. But they obviously won't retract it, they ideologize it by saying the SOTA has moved on now anyway, so it doesn't matter. Peer review is not a real safeguard.

Thank you once again for the detailed answer. What prevent this system from becoming a "review cartel". (lacking a better word). Say a group of people where to sit on all the power and just decide what gets approved and rejected.

What prevents people from using harder-to-game metrics such as h-index or Altmetrics?  Is it because they're less intuitive? Or because theae metrics don't work for recently published articles?  
Forgive me for being new. But what is this obsession with releasing new papers? Is papers seen as some way to get a salary or something? If you really wanted to do AI research, would it not be better to be payed by a private company?  
 Is papers seen as some way to get a salary or something?  This dramatically oversimplifies the issue, but yes. There is a strong correlation between the volume of output rather than quality of output, and this incentives as much publishing as possible.  If you really wanted to do AI research, would it not be better to be payed by a private company?  You'll find that the most notable members of the ML community tend to split their time between academia and the private sector, or they are within academia yet funded by the private sector.

Thank you for that answer. What is the benefit of staying in academia vs. full time private sector?

Doing academic research in a private company is largely the same. You'll still be evaluated by the same metrics, papers and citations, and in some companies promotions will be tied to that. A lot of your colleagues will be in or from university academia. The main benefit is that your salary is better. The benefit of staying in university academia is that, at least in theory, you can work on more long-term ambitious research without the pressure of producing short-term results for a company. I say in in theory because it's not that easy unless you have tenure.

Papers used to be the equivalent of blog posts of the old times. Before the internet, journals and conferences were the only way to show your research to other people. If you did some cool research you had no way to "post it on Reddit" or to Arxiv. At some point however, people started counting papers (and their citation counts) as a measure of how "good" a researcher you are. So people started slicing their research to Least Publishable Units. It became a game to win peer review. In savvy groups, everything about paper writing is how to think like a reviewer, how to please the reviewer. This is pretty different from pleasing and satisfying someone who is already interested, like your actual readers will be who find the paper and read it by their own will. However, that matters little for paper writing. When people care about post-publication impact, they usually make project websites, blog posts etc. The paper is still important of course, but you need to market it also through other means, release well-documented easy-to-use code etc. Unfortunately, this type of work is less incentivized. Instead of cleaning up your code and writing an overview blog post (which perhaps nobody will read), you can churn out the next paper. Publication and getting though peer review has become the trophy in itself, when it actually should just be a filter. The real test comes *after* publication. You know how each paper says "We propose ....", well, that's what it is even after publication: a proposal, that the research community may take or leave. *That* is the real question. Arguably, citations measure this, but most citations are in lists of [these papers also tackled this task] and in experimental result tables. That's not really meaningful engagement and does not mean someone took up the "proposal". It jut means your result got compared to. Sure that's not nothing, but it's not the same as being actually picked up as a method that the community now uses. Most proposed methods never get adopted by anyone else.

You are correct, but it's not a problem for ML specifically ,it's a general problem. We are living in strange days, where it's not about what you do/publish, but with whom you are associated. We have an inflation of paper submissions, because we use it as an KPI. We have diversity issues, because we involving color, gender in our criteria to form a team. It's not about who you are, it's about what sex, color or whatever you have. We need a diversity of mindset, not of biological features. Saying you don't consider race as a criteria, makes you a racist. Insane.

[D] The machine learning community has a toxicity problem
Thanks for writing this up. Many of these problems exist across all academia though. The big underlying problems are our ancient, outdated ways of communicating scientific findings (separate manuscripts and prose that can only be updated by completing a new project) and the way we do scientific quality checks (an, in practice random selection of 2-3 community peer reviewers). Also, a belief in an only recently established incentive system (number of completed projects written up in manuscripts) that might increase the overall amount of completed projects, but is often to the detriment of quality and increases the amount of shoddy research and researchers in the system. The first two problems only exist because submitting papers to peer review was the best that could exist before the digital age. The system has just not been adapted to the digital age yet because people who currently have most power did not have their formative years in this age, and either don't realise its possibilities or are dissatisfied by the ancient ways too, but know that substantial changes are better left to the new generation. It is in the hands of the current, new generation of scientists to change the scientific system for the better, and move it to the digital age. We all realise its problems and don't have to submit to problematic practices thats improvements are overdue.

i will never voice my opinions in academia because i don't want to risk being cancelled. but i agree with majority of this post.  
[D] The machine learning community has a toxicity problem
I totally agree with 99% of your stuff. All of them are great points. Although I will contest one of these points:  machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge diversity problem  I will say, in my experience, I did not find it to be particularly exclusionary. (I still agree on making the culture healthier and more welcoming for all people, but won't call it a huge diversity problem, that is any different from what plagues other fields) I also think it has very little to do with those in CS or intentional rejection of minorities/women by CS as a field. Far fewer women and minorities enroll in  CS, so it is more of a highschool problem than anything. If anything, CS tries really really hard to hire and attract under represented groups into the fold. That it fails, does not necessarily mean it is exclusionary. Many other social factors tend to be at play behind cohort statistics. An ML person knows that better than anyone.                There is a huge push towards hiring black and latino people and women as well. Far more than any other STEM field. Anyone who has gone to GHC knows how much money is spent on trying to make CS look attractive to women. ( I support both initiatives, but I do think enough is being done)  A few anecdotes from the hackernews thread the other day, as to greater social reasons for women not joining tech. Sample 1:  There's one other possible, additional reason. I recently asked a 17-year-old high school senior who is heading to college what she's planning to study, and she said it would be mathematics, biomedical engineering, or some other kind of engineering. She's self-motivated -- says she will be studying multi-variate calculus, PDEs, and abstract algebra on her own this summer. She maxed out her high school math curriculum, which included linear algebra as an elective. Naturally, I asked her about computer science, and she said something like this (paraphrasing): "The kids who love computers at my high school seem to be able to spend their entire day focusing on a computer screen, even on weekends. I cannot do that. And those kids are mostly boys whose social behavior is a little bit on the spectrum." While I don't fully agree with her perspective, it makes me wonder how many other talented people shun the field for similar reasons.  Sample2:   My niece had almost the exact same opinion despite having multiple family members who didn't fit that description, including her mother! It wasn't until I introduced her to some of my younger female co-workers that she committed to being a CS major. She's now a third generation software engineer, which has to be fairly unique. I've talked to her about it and she can't really articulate why. I'm closer to the nerd stereotype in that I'm on the computer a lot but her mother (my sister) definitely is not. I think it's mostly pop and teen culture still harboring the antisocial stigma. I'll have to talk to her some more. There is probably some connection with video games, in that boys overwhelmingly play games where girls do not. I don't think the games cause the disparity; whatever it is that draws boys to VGs is what draws them to CS as well  You can't blame the field for being unable to fight off stigma imposed by 80-90s movies on an entire generations. For example, there is no dearth of Indian women in CS. (I think it is similar for Chinese people too). Both societies did not undergo the collective humiliation of nerds that the US went through, and CS is considered a respectable 'high status' field, where people of any personality type can gel in. Thus, women do not face the same kind of intimidation. This is a "US high school and US culture" problem. Not a CS problem.   Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career.   To be fair, this is common to almost all academic fields. CS is no exception and I strongly support the having more accommodations for female employees in this regard.  Honestly, look at almost all "high stress, high workload" jobs and men are over-represented in almost all areas. Additionally, they tend to be a very particular kind of obsessive "work is life" kind of men. While women are discouraged form having such an unhealthy social life, men are actively pushed in this direction by society. IMO, we should not be seeking equality by pushing women to abide by male stereotypes. Maybe, if CS became a little better for everyone, it would benefit all kinds of people who are seeking healthier lives, men and women alike. This actually flows quite well into your next point of "cut-throat publish-or-perish mentality".

You make great points. The US seems to have a very anti science culture and people who conform to social norms aren't the ones who will go into science fields. My husband is a white guy in tech and I'm an Indian woman in tech and he always felt like the nerdiest person wherever he went before he met me and always tried to tone it down. Then he met my friends, who were moms with kids and musicians and every kind of person who all had chosen programming for a better life and his perspective just changed.  With regards to diversity, the most diverse companies also tend to be the most chilled out, because people from underrepresented communities usually have a lot of responsibilities outside of work. And these companies don't survive very long. I've worked at a company that was heavily middle aged women, and it was great, but not having a culture of killer instinct and long hours and big results kind of let all the people who were good at posturing and politics rise to the top. We lost top talent to competitors, and we absorbed the worst of the competition. Right now that place is going through a crisis. Our cut throat not-diverse competition is thriving though.

My little sister excels at math and really quickly picked up modding games (mostly resource files rather than programming) when I showed her how to get started. But when I asked her whether she'd considered studying some kind of CS or engineering discipline she just went "yeah no that's not for me". Her overall impression was similar to the one you quote in Sample 1 ("CS is for antisocial people") , but she also said going into CS as a girl felt like a statement. To some extent I wish the culture was different enough that she didn't have those associations, but most of all I think it's a shame that we've managed to convince her that she wouldn't fit in as is.

My anecdotal experience shows that the best algomerithic thinkers are a bit on the spectrum. Out of my colleagues, professors and classmates. Maybe 10% was nerdy but of the top 10% thinkers 80% was nerdy.  What surprised me was that someone would choose math when considering spectrum. In my university the spectrum is Math>Physics>Eng. Math/Physics>CS/EE>Other Eng.

Far fewer women and minorities enroll in  CS, so it is more of a highschool problem than anything. If anything, CS tries really really hard to hire and attract under represented groups into the fold. That it fails, does not necessarily mean it is exclusionary. Many other social factors tend to be at play behind cohort statistics. An ML person knows that better than anyone.                There is a huge push towards hiring black and latino people and women as well. Far more than any other STEM field. Anyone who has gone to GHC knows how much money is spent on trying to make CS look attractive to women. ( I support both initiatives, but I do think enough is being done)  A few anecdotes from the hackernews thread the other day, as to greater social reasons for women not joining tech. Sample 1:  There's one other possible, additional reason. I recently asked a 17-year-old high school senior who is heading to college what she's planning to study, and she said it would be mathematics, biomedical engineering, or some other kind of engineering. She's self-motivated -- says she will be studying multi-variate calculus, PDEs, and abstract algebra on her own this summer. She maxed out her high school math curriculum, which included linear algebra as an elective. Naturally, I asked her about computer science, and she said something like this (paraphrasing): "The kids who love computers at my high school seem to be able to spend their entire day focusing on a computer screen, even on weekends. I cannot do that. And those kids are mostly boys whose social behavior is a little bit on the spectrum." While I don't fully agree with her perspective, it makes me wonder how many other talented people shun the field for similar reasons.  Sample2:   My niece had almost the exact same opinion despite having multiple family members who didn't fit that description, including her mother! It wasn't until I introduced her to some of my younger female co-workers that she committed to being a CS major. She's now a third generation software engineer, which has to be fairly unique. I've talked to her about it and she can't really articulate why. I'm closer to the nerd stereotype in that I'm on the computer a lot but her mother (my sister) definitely is not. I think it's mostly pop and teen culture still harboring the antisocial stigma. I'll have to talk to her some more. There is probably some connection with video games, in that boys overwhelmingly play games where girls do not. I don't think the games cause the disparity; whatever it is that draws boys to VGs is what draws them to CS as well  You can't blame the field for being unable to fight off stigma imposed by 80-90s movies on an entire generations. For example, there is no dearth of Indian women in CS. (I think it is similar for Chinese people too). Both societies did not undergo the collective humiliation of nerds that the US went through, and CS is considered a respectable 'high status' field, where people of any personality type can gel in. Thus, women do not face the same kind of intimidation. This is a "US high school and US culture" problem. Not a CS problem.   Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career.   To be fair, this is common to almost all academic fields. CS is no exception and I strongly support the having more accommodations for female employees in this regard.  Honestly, look at almost all "high stress, high workload" jobs and men are over-represented in almost all areas. Additionally, they tend to be a very particular kind of obsessive "work is life" kind of men. While women are discouraged form having such an unhealthy social life, men are actively pushed in this direction by society. IMO, we should not be seeking equality by pushing women to abide by male stereotypes. Maybe, if CS became a little better for everyone, it would benefit all kinds of people who are seeking healthier lives, men and women alike. This actually flows quite well into your next point of "cut-throat publish-or-perish mentality".  
This is a great comment. I really like the points you mentioned. Pushing underrepresented groups into the field for the sake of representation doesn't seem like a good idea in the long run for any party in this problem. I find it extremely ironic that in both stories the girls are so heavily prejudiced towards CS people. I wish all people crying about female underrepresentation would notice that it's not usually about sexism in CS field but more about this stupid "nerdy loser with social anxiety" stereotype that is unattractive to people (and obviously false). But, as you said, this is a high-school problem (I'd even say that an elementary-school one).   I really can't understand why people behind all these promotional programs are so focused on fighting sexism for the good of young girls but at the same time they seem like they haven't even asked these girls what the real problem is. Maybe they could learn about the awful label of being "a little bit on the spectrum" (wtf?!) imprinted in kids' heads and come to a valuable conclusion that the problem they fight has its roots in completely different places.

to be honest 'being a little bit in the spectrum' is probably another result of the phenomenon that also makes people good at analitical thinking. so it's not in people' head in my opinion, it's quite obvious. that being unappealing is of course a social norm, but if it makes one unsociable, who can really challenge that? otherwise i agree with all your and the parent comment's points

 In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL).  I agree with a lot of what you are saying, but I think this point is a bit unfair. I've encountered situations where 2/3 of the reviews are glowing, but there are pervasive, major errors in the mathematical descriptions of things. The paper doesn't make sense. I think there are serious issues with getting enough competent reviewers to deal with the deluge of ML papers being submitted right now and that many reviewers, including well qualified ones, are not putting enough time into reviews. For me to do a thoughtful review (I've been reviewing for NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS for 6 years) takes me at least 5 hours per paper. I see people saying that they spend <2 hours per review. The following is a particularly egregious example of this, a professor at a world-class university starting his reviews 2 days after the deadline: https://imgur.com/a/hfUIhZz Because of this its becoming more crucial for the ACs and meta-reviewers themselves to make  judgement calls on papers' worthiness and cannot rely so much on the reviewers. e:formatting

I’d add (your post being an example, no offence): Eighthly: an under appreciation of the importance of statistics. As we know there’s the CS side and statistics side of ML. The former of which are notoriously dismissive of the importance of the latter. To the point that statistics has almost become a loaded term in the mind of many from the CS side. I myself have had discussions with people here who have literally said that any knowledge of statistics is entirely useless in ML. So let’s remove the word statistics and focus on (some of) the important aspects that having a strong understanding/appreciation of statistics provides, such as the ability/realisation that understanding the subtle assumptions made in the technique(s) developed are crucially vital.  Ok some times taking a pragmatic approach rather than tying yourself in knots worrying about inherent assumptions in your technique can speed progress, but it’s also vital in understanding the limitations of your technique and where it will breakdown - not only from an algorithmic/numerical standpoint, but from a reproducibility standpoint. I’d argue this is an important causative factor in why your second point exists.

On point no.6, moral and ethics: In 2019, Yoshua Bengio tried to promote a new set of guidelines developed by a group of not only AI experts but also ethics experts. You can read the declaration here Unfortunately, adhering to these principles is still entirely voluntary and it hasn’t caught on. You can see the limited list of organizations who have already signed here. Ignoring the fact there is no clear framework for holding the adhering organizations accountable, it would have been nice to see the community at least adhering on principle. Edit: As a constructive actionable item, you can still sign the declaration as an individual practitioner, or you could advocate for the organization you work for to sign it.

 Secondly, there is a reproducibility crisis. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.  PPO Anyone?  Secondly, there is a reproducibility crisis.

As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any. Thirdly, there is a worshiping problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name "neural" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the "godfathers" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.  I don't want to point fingers but there's marginal improvement in DQN over NFQ but the former has over an order of magnitude more citations than the latter and the difference between the two is who had more compute to test stuff and more memory to store all the 10M transitions....

I was extremely annoyed by how Adji says "This gwern guy is researching embryo selection". If anything, I choose to believe that he's performing science, and not openly advocating for discrimination. I looked up a bit more, and he seems to be doing research in a plethora of fields. Another tweet of Adji that annoys me is how she decides to ignore him, because she thinks he has eugenistic ideologies. I think it's very baseless. https://twitter.com/adjiboussodieng/status/1277689240990728198

Perhaps we need a new conference that gives equal merit to negative results. Makes publishing preprints that are not anonymous (and not shared by the author on twitter) and that makes some improvements with the peer-review process so it's less arbitrary.  I feel like by focusing on merit rather than names that would alleviate some of these issues. Perhaps open discussion could be promoted/rewarded somehow also? and additionally inappropriate conduct punished in the same way. Focus on the science and the ideas not the people

Moral and ethics should be part of the curriculum in ML education and paper discussions. If we do not educate people then it's hard to control what any company could do for the sake of profit. I still feel disgusted to have found in a research showcase presentation a database field called IsUyghur. Apparently the subsidiary research lab in China from a silicon valley company was responsible for it. Funny that the company wanted to join people together.

I strongly agree with you on the first 3 points. For point five I think you underestimate how good 30% is, in mechanical engineering only 13% of B.S. are going to women and electrical engineering is only 12%. Not to say that we are perfect, but 30% is progress. For six I think you leave out that a large portion of research is conducted in the US. So it makes sense that people would be very concerned with the US policy and ignorant of the PRC use of the technology.  ​ If you want to discuss further feel free to DM me, I'm literally always down to talk about the state our field and how some of it is a complete shit show.

Every single issue listed here is right on the money. I am an MSc student at a top uni and although I have published a few papers in top conferences, the absolute stress and mental headache of the publish and perish mentality and the broader issues mentioned here is strongly motivating me to not pursue a PhD, although I had been set on doing so for a great while. For the first year of my masters, I was constantly reminded that I don't yet have a published paper yet, and without it (or some amazing internal references/connections) access to good research internships are rare, and without that, goes the chance to build connections and get exposure (the deepmind, Google hype that OP mentioned) that is crucial for success deeper into PhD and beyond. It's as if every step from the day you start uni must be perfectly placed, lest you be banished to academic wilderness. It also didn't help that my work was not in neural net/CV/NLP but in game theory+ML which is more niche meaning less visibility, less interesting to industry and others, and so on. Ofc, one does not and should not do research for "visibility" or "hype" or to publish only in a handful of venues skewed toward deep learning, but unfortunately this seems like the reality of our field. A great many days I honestly felt like I part of some strange cult and wondering what the hell I'm doing here. Even after publishing papers, I didn't feel this anxiety reduce by much. I honestly loved the work I did and the advisor and peers I worked it, who were all amazing. However, the broader setting is just deeply toxic. ML grad school feels like the cut-throat, constantly selling you and your work, virtue signalling yet indifferent mentality of industry combined with poverty wage and financial struggles of grad school. I hope that as a community, we listen and act instead of paying lip-service, accept that negative results and failed attempts are an important part of scientific research and not every paper must be SOTA to be meaningful, realize the myriad pressures grad students are under and setting the minimum threshold of success to be k papers/year at n conferences/journal doesn't make a great researcher but rather burnout or reward-hacking, stop putting certain people on pedestals, and we critically question the merits of industry dominating academia with half of top profs/departments being in their payroll in the name of some platitude.

You seem to be only considering the top hyped labs for doing your PhD. Many lower-tier labs don't expect you to have tons of publications before you start the PhD, in many cases not even one. But for some reason I guess you would not want to work with those profs. You want to work under a perfect (famous) prof, but complain that they only take perfect students. It goes both ways. Tons of people get PhD's outside the elite groups and they can still have a career. But I agree. If I look at famous researchers they often had a straight, perfect road. Undergrad in a famous uni, already working in the field, then joining a famous lab, etc. There's a wide selection possibility for famous profs nowadays. Why should they pick someone less accomplished? They got to where they are because they pick highly competitive people who put in insane hours and strive forward. You may not like it, it may not be for everyone and it may not even be healthy. There are also other things out there. Not all basketball players can play in the NBA. You can't have a well-balanced life and be Michael Phelps. It is not ML-specific, not academia-specific. It's a competition, a status game, just like anything else in life.

 However, the toxicity and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity  There are many vocal people in DS and tech in general who think critical theory is the only lens to examine the world through rather than it being one of many. It's a real problem and makes it next to impossible to have a conversation with these people. My guess is most of them don't even realize they are engaging in a dialectic which embraces subjective truth. Meanwhile most of us are still using our boring old objective truth to examine the world and try to form reasonable arguments.

At the root of these issues ... we've all noticed an aggressive push for "social justice" in the machine learning community. This has been organized by a small number of politically motivated activists who do not represent the community as a whole, outsiders who aren't ML experts themselves. Its impact on the community has been extremely negative. This can be seen in how LeCun was recently silenced on Twitter, or how some people are now claiming they should get more citations because of their skin color or gender.

In the outrage against LeCun, nobody had any disagreement with what he said, it was that he was, quote: "mansplaining/whitesplaining". In other words, the problem was not what he said, the problem was his gender and skin color.  When we value people's opinions based on their skin color, that's called racism. When we value people's opinions based on their gender, that's called sexism. And researchers said this with their full name on Twitter, and it had apparently no consequences for them. The only consequences happened to the recipient, LeCun, who is now silenced. It is as if the world has forgotten all the principles people have fought for over the last 50 years.

Hmm, I came from a chemical engineering background, and it sounds like a lot applies to my research area (nano material) as well. I think it's a general issue for academia, and a lot of it comes from the pressure for publishing papers. When the pressure is on, things like reproducibility and integerity are just out of the window. And when everybody tries to use tricks to get paper published, you'll have to do it too if you want to keep up with the performance, it's a horrible arms race.

Yes, a million times of yes. As a junior researcher in this field who is going to start my career as an assistant professor, I am seriously considering quitting research and just go to industry to find a job and work in peace. What is happening right now in the ML community reminds me of what happened in the SU or China in the mid of the last century. This is essentially a kind of silencing -- I don't dare to publicly (say, on Twitter) express my opinion since I know I would easily lose my current job if I do so. Look at Yann, what happened to him in the last few days is astonishing. I understand that there is systematic racism and sexism in this country, but this does NOT mean that everything should be interpreted and explained in this way. Honestly, I feel that some of them are just playing the race/sex card in order to maximize their own utility, e.g., more citations, more visibility etc. What a shame! I never see this happens in maths or theoretical physics. It's a shame that the pursuit of pure research and truth needs to surrender to political correctness.

 Fourthly, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive.   I understand why you might feel you have to say this, but it isn't true, and catering to that mindset is only going to provide a beachhead for future unreasonable backlashes. People who jumped on LeCun overplayed their hand, but they're still in the community, and will happily jump on other innocent remarks the second we let them think they've got a receptive audience for it. Saying that biased datasets cause problems is not a racist act, there are four lights.  People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.  Very big agree! We need to incentivize outreach and risk-taking.  Secondly, there is a reproducibility crisis. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to avoid this scenario (other than from a conference gatekeeper's perspective)? I've yet to see any.  If Method A is innately more able to get use out of hyperparameter tuning than Method B, then in some sense the only way to get a fair comparison between them is to tune the hyperparameters on both to the utmost limit. Abstaining from hyperparameter tuning seems like it means avoiding comparisons that are fair with respect to likely applications of interest.

Newbie here coming from an adjacent field, but if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like "tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice" means the tuning process and the final score reported are using the same set, which sounds troubling to me. Tuning hyperparameters on a test set leaks information about that test data into your model - I've understood the best practice to be using a separate validation set for tuning and then a test set for reporting, which you (ideally) only ever run your model on once so there's no leakage into how your model is built. If tuning on the same set you eventually report results with really standard practice these days? I get that in practice it's usually not feasible to only run on that test set a single time, but surely a tuning process that uses it is basically using your test set to train an aspect of your model, which sounds like a huge problem. And, if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like the solution is for reviewers to be incredibly wary of test set leakage into a training protocol.

Newbie here coming from an adjacent field, but if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like "tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice" means the tuning process and the final score reported are using the same set, which sounds troubling to me. Tuning hyperparameters on a test set leaks information about that test data into your model - I've understood the best practice to be using a separate validation set for tuning and then a test set for reporting, which you (ideally) only ever run your model on once so there's no leakage into how your model is built. If tuning on the same set you eventually report results with really standard practice these days? I get that in practice it's usually not feasible to only run on that test set a single time, but surely a tuning process that uses it is basically using your test set to train an aspect of your model, which sounds like a huge problem. And, if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like the solution is for reviewers to be incredibly wary of test set leakage into a training protocol.  
People won't explicitly write this in the paper. They just say what hyperparams they used and don't mention how they got them. There are also a lot of small hyperparams that are not all even described in papers. Everyone knows it shouldn't be like that. Proper scientific conduct is often a short term disadvantage. If you're careless, you still got a publication. If you're too careful you may never beat the scores of those who tune on the test set or play other tricks, use some ground truth information during testing etc. The only way around this is having truly held out test sets and evaluation servers with limited evaluations. For some benchmarks, you need to submit predictions by email and the benchmark maintainers evaluate it for you.  
  Secondly, there is a reproducibility crisis. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.

You are right. People shouldn't really tune their models on a test set. Some people actually make the test set a validation set (stop training once the test score peaks). It's not standard ML practice, or standard science practice, but they do it anyway.

[D] The machine learning community has a toxicity problem
Quite right, for the most part.     There's no clear consensus for making papers publicly available while under submission. One one side, it means the research is not available while under review which kind of defeats the whole purpose of research (sharing it with everyone, and not sitting around 2-3 months). On the other hand, sharing it and making posts everywhere does compromise anonymity: even if the reviewers don't search explicitly for the paper, they 're highly likely to stumble upon it if their research lies in that area (arXiv update tweets, gs updates, RTs by people they follow, etc). I guess a straightforward solution would be to have a version of arXiv with higher anonymity, where author affiliation is revealed only after decisions (to the journal/conference to which that research is submitted) have been made. We need to think much more about this specific problem.    Reproducibility is indeed an issue. I honestly don't know why we're in 2020 and machine learning papers can still get away without providing code/trained models. Evaluating the trained model (which is, in the majority of ML related papers, the result) by the reviewers via an open-source system, perhaps like a test-bed specific for applications? For instance, evaluating the robustness of a model on Imagenet. This, of course, should happen along with making code both compulsory and running it as well. This may be a problem for RL related systems, but this doesn't mean we shouldn't even try doing this for any of the submissions.    Very true. For some part, it's the responsibility of organizers to not always run after the top 5-6 names, and include younger researchers to help audiences get familiar with a more diverse (and most times, interesting) set of research and ideas. For the other part, it is also up to the researchers to draw the line when they see themselves talking about the same slides at multiple venues over and over again.    This specific instance is somewhat debatable. Compared to the level of backlash and toxicity women and people of color receive online is not even close to what he did. Nonetheless, the discussion could be much cleaner.    I agree with the first half. I do see companies doing something about this, but surely not enough. Also, it's a bit sad/sketchy that most AI research labs do not openly release statistics about their gender/ethnicity distributions.

Per point #1, it seems like it should be possible to submit a paper to a site like arXiv with provisional anonymity -- either time- or date-based that allows the paper to be posted publicly while also not divulging the author prior to peer review.

Yeah, exactly! And for young researchers that are concerned about their citations (and for good reason), a network-based citation system could be developed? Or perhaps simply keep track of citations in a researcher's profile but aggregate all anonymous references and retain their anonymity until the decision happens. A bit far fetcher, but certainly doable. I'm sure there are better solutions, but they won't implement themselves until we can come to a consensus as a community.

For point 5, I attended a pretty liberal small college. I remember a friend thinking a fairly political class (gen ed requirement) and being a white male just decided that it'd be much better to be silent as he felt any opinion he gave that wasn't near identical to the general class opinion would be criticized a lot. I also know as someone who mostly agrees with Lecun's comments I have little desire to enter publicly in discussions on a topic like that on twitter and would expect to get similar complaints. ​ On 8, calling out a sexist comment as a sexist statement is fine. Just calling someone a sexist while it fits definition wise is likely to make them a lot more defensive and be a poor method of interacting with them and also likely to create that same fear of engagement. Mostly the difference in what feels like an attack of a statement vs an attack of a person.

Almost completely agree with this. On point 5. I think many people would like to engage in a civil way but in today's climate even engaging in a civil way runs a substantial risk which is why they (and I) choose not to do it.

I see the paypal link, if you want to monetize, you should strongly consider minting some clips as as ethereum NFTs (see e.g., https://rarible.com/). This is exactly the type of digital art that's going for a whole lot of $$$. Audio/visual possible using IPFS.

Let's not waste tons of energy on this useless shit.  
There’s no connection between NFTs and energy consumption, this is a bizarre trope. Ethereum mining will consume energy for PoW, but there’s no direct connection between the type of transaction or the number of transactions and energy usage.  The expenditure of energy is at the block level, and is independent of transactions (mining an empty block is  just hard as mining a full one).  On the other hand the income it can make for an artist can be life changing.

That's a relative (as in, relative to where youre running your script from) path you're trying to use, and those don't contain beginning slashes. It looks like youre on Windows - if so, get the full path using pathlib:  import pathlib cwd = pathlib.Pathlib(__file__).parent.absolute() target = cwd + 'filename.mp3' You may have to add a slash (or backward slash, or double backward slash, Windows being Windows) before the filename, I didn't actually try running this. Also, use Linux.

First and foremost - thank you very much fore being so generous to share this and license it under MIT! Now, considering that on the Github page it says  By default, it uses NVLabs StyleGAN2, with pre-trained models lifted from Justin Pinkney's consolidated repository. Custom weights and other GAN architectures can be used as well  , does that mean that any generated material cannot be monetized on YouTube or such, since Nvidia Source Code License-NC claims that any derivative work may not be used for commercial purposes? And if so, are there any pretrained alternatives? I'd really appreciate the answer! :)

The band is super small and if they wanted to put it as a youtube video I don't think they would monetize it but I'd still want them to somehow credit you. Just hypothetically if they were to like the outcome or I can of course just give them the surprise and say the author isn't open to people sharing their own videos with the package if that's the case also.  ​ Really awesome work though!!

The google colab notebook is so well done that I think I'll be able to teach my friends who are in the band who have no background in programming to use it within an hour.  I see lots of cool projects posted on this sub but rarely are there ones that are implemented so well that beginners can use it with little to no experience.

Is there any way to have it sample from 2 or more image libraries at once and have it mix them in the styles? ​ I thought I might have had some success by adding an "and" but then it only chose one of the styles. ​ Would be super cool to combine say abstract art with beetles :)

I made a video about this project, which I did for a visualization class at Technical University Vienna (TU Wien), 2 years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8psghc/project_realtime_interactive_visualization_of/ The code / Unity project can be found here: https://github.com/stefsietz/nn-visualizer, but it is not in a state of good code quality, so maybe try one of the forks or a project like https://tensorspace.org/, which seems to accomplish similar visualizations and looks like it's well maintained. The "pulse" animation was basically just a test of the visualization's ability to expand one "spatially shared kernel" into the actual per pixel kernels as used during computation. This sudden attention comes really unexpected as this video was just a short WIP clip I shared on IG 2 years ago.Right now I am working at the really awesome AI company kaleido.ai on products such as remove.bg, unscreen.com and more. And we are hiring ;-) https://www.remove.bg/careers

I know this is late but damn I've been using remove.bg for so long now. It's crazy to just come across a guy who works in the company that made it! Browsing old Reddit posts can really be wild huh. Anyway, respects to you and your team for creating these awesome products! They helped me photoshop random things many times!

Just a heads up—a post with this video came up on my LinkedIn feed just now without any attribution or link to the repo. The poster was using it to promote his own website and while he didn’t say so directly, there was a pretty clear implication that his company was somehow responsible for producing it. Not sure if this is something you care about but if you want I can PM you the guy’s info.

Right now I have an example script for a simple dense neural network on MNIST data under examples/process_mnist_model.py . I don't have a automated function yet. To create such a file for another neural network you have to code a bit and provide a small subset (maybe <  10%) of the training/test data and unfortunately only dense layers are supported, but I might add support for different layers (convolutional) with examples.

Does this tell us anything about the activations or just show the structure of the layers?  
looks like its just the structure since all the connections are the same color and same size... maybe he will do activations as the next step, it should not be too hard to add a script that scales the diameters or adjusts the colors in accordance to the value of that weight

Basically something like this (a convolutional neural network), visualized in 3D. I assume the pulsing "waves" that we see in the animation are forward (and backward) propagations. But I'm not sure if those are actually weighted or just for show.

Straya noises intensify  
Is there a reason you're doing this instead of just using the existing RL bot API?  
Because the RL bots can barely hit the ball when it's on the ground.  
do you leave the agent to learn airdribbling (or whatever else) on his own like over many attempts, or do you feed him suggestions or directions? i'm here from r/all, idk anything about machine learning. edit: fun fact though, i do play rl and know how to airdribble and kuxir twist (constant barrel roll), so this is cool to see.  
Hey, not op but I work with these technologies. He is using something called reinforcement learning. The AI is told it's goal (keep the ball in the air as long as possible) and then given access to the controls. The AI starts off moving randomly, but after a while it has learned to air dribble.

that's amazing. another question - would it be possible to add speed into the mix? i'm interested because this is a big thing in rl, finding the fastest way to make any play. so if the goal for this ai was adjusted to something like 'get the ball over there to that spot, as fast as possible' is that something that the ai can figure out, like what the fastest possible time the play can be made in is? better example would be 'airdribble the ball over to that spot as fast as possible' in which case i'd wonder if the ai would learn then to airdribble in a different way than what is shown in op's post. would it keep trying everything in order to know what's possible, and basically keep trying forever, or would it reach some threshold with one method and assume it couldn't get any faster and just stick with that. does there need to be a boundary or is 'as possible' a usable parameter?

Sure. Whatever a reinforcement learning algorithm learns is determined by a cost function - some way of quantifying the goal. So if you can clearly quantify it, then it can be learned. The goal would just be to find the set of actions that minimizes the time taken to get the ball to point X.  For the second example, you can sum cost functions to achieve multiple outcomes. The cost function there might be the time taken to get the ball to point X plus a penalty - the penalty is zero if the ball stays in the air, and it’s really big if the ball hits the ground.  One caveat is that it’s not always easy for these algorithms to generalize to similar scenarios. E.g. it may do fine if you train it on the problem “start at point A, juggle the ball in the air and get it to point B”, but then it might have problems if you ask it to start from point C instead. It may also take a lot of time to learn the first problem as well. Part of the modern challenges in research is making algorithms that can better identify patterns to learn more efficiently and generally, so that an algorithm can handle similar problems a lot better.  
This looks insane man, I might be interested in doing a video on your work if you're down!

Looks to me that it's just a +1 for every time step that the ball is kept above the agent (ie that it doesn't fall to the ground)

Does it really not cover the bottom part of the car? Not even the body of the car?  
What do you mean by "not covering the bottom the car"? You can of course hit the ball with the bottom of the car which allows skilled players to go for things like "flipresets". The hitbox is only kinda related to the body of the car. There are about 20 different cars (probably more) and only 5 or 6 different hitboxes for the cars. All cars sharing a hitbox are completely identical and all differences are purely cosmetical. (Same goes for add-ons for your car. 100% cosmetical)

Looking at the picture, much of the wheels and the bottom slice of the body aren't in the box. Which means there are many ways to see your car intersect with the ball but not see a collision effect.

Really nice work! I considered doing this a while back because using RLBot would be to slow, but abandoned the idea because it felt like too much work. What concerns me the most is the transferability of the learners into Rocket League. Because looking at your simulation the ball seems a bit lighter and more bouncy than in RL. Have you tried running the same model using RLBot to see if it'll transfer well into the actual game?

Oh my gosh, I've been wanting for this to become a reality -- especially after seeing OpenAI play DOTA.

Actually no, they skipped the written adaptation entirely.

Of course. But the speed of data-gathering by phonetic transcription is about one-tenth the speed one can transcribe in a writing system. Also, for phonetic transcription you really need to train people, whereas in this case, for the Chinese characters you don't.

Yes, it appears they initially trained with massive Mandarin datasets and then finetuned to Hokkien with a much smaller Hokkien dataset.

Not all written system can support that. For instance, there’s a limit to what the common English alphabet write out certain complex phonemes. IPA is the best, but it’s very complex for an average person to learn.

I'm a Hokkien (Taiwanese-flavor) and Mandarin speaker.  Mandarin is impossible to alphabetize because there are way too many homonyms.  Hokkien on the other hand(like Cantonese) has I think about 9 tones, so there are fewer homonyms, so phonetic forms like Lomaji exist for it.  And there are competing forms where similar sounding Chinese characters are used.  But since Hokkien speakers usually also speak Mandarin, Mandarin tends to be used exclusively for formal or legal purposes so Hokkien speakers really just use it for speech, and when they need to write things they just write in Mandarin.   This makes learning Hokkien very difficult for non-native Hokkien speakers.  
Why not just write it out phonetically?  
Missionaries did that a few hundred years ago and left Taiwanese a system called Peh-oe-ji (POJ), mainly used for Bible translation and is not standardized written system in Taiwan. It is a romanization of the language, along with the tone for each word. The problem with Taigi (or Taiwanese Hokkien) is the tonal change rule when speaking. POJ denotes each word’s stand-alone tone and is used for writing. However, when reading it out loud we have to change the tone or else it sounds weird. Kind of like “read” or “content” where we have to figure out its tone by context when reading them out loud.  
The whole project strongly leverages the fact that a written form (in Han characters) actually exists. Impressive all the same, but not sure how to extend this to other languages.  
I wonder to what extent it can translate formal speech (which I'm guessing is very near Mandarin-pronounced-as-the-dialect), vs. native informal speech (which presumably is farther from Mandarin and has extra idioms, grammar, & vocab).

“Humanity” and the idea of humanity are terms of art, not science. Fair enough, isn’t it, to say we aren’t humans but bio bots (I agree), then isn’t it equally fair to say we aren’t bio bots but arraignments of sub atomic particles? The real is not only unknowable, it is also unspeakable. Art, in the very broadest sense, is the manipulation of the incomprehensible with the goal of some kind of relevance or traction. This is true at any level of humanity.  In short: our fictive humanity has the same quantities of relevance and value as our constructed science.

Not related but I wish Meta were spending more of its brain cycles on not-stupid things. From where I'm standing just looking at open source work, the talent there is head and shoulders above the other big 5 companies and it bums me out that some portion of that is being spent on cartoon legs.

I wasn’t aware of the financial magnitude of funding (if that is accurate) but even if that’s true it doesn’t change my opinion in the slightest.  Hypothetically, let’s say funding by Zuckerberg resulted in some substantial AI milestones being achieved in 5-10 years less than it would have otherwise. Even if that’s the case it wouldn’t even begin to offset the negatives he has inflicted on the world.  He could fund AI research to a level representing 100% of his net worth and it wouldn’t ‘make up for’ the death and desolation he has directly made possible in Myanmar for one example. I’m not saying he is actively evil, but he has zero regard for the externalities he causes. Every situation where a decision could be made where one outcome is good for Facebook, and the other is not detrimental for society has gone in Facebooks favor regardless of the consequences others pay for his actions.

This is only one specific example of many.  In many parts of the developing world paying for mobile data plans is a burdensome expense, so Facebook has agreements with service providers around the world that makes Facebook free to access.  While this seem like a positive or neutral thing at first, the result is Facebook becomes the ENTIRE accessible internet for the vast majority of people in those locations.  Just look up the atrocities that where committed in Myanmar the past few years. Essentially zero moderation or oversight was put in place since it’s a different language, and as a result the worst aspects of human nature ran unchecked into a feedback loop of hate resulting in fucking ethnic cleansing!!!

I agree to an extent, however I think Zuckerberg was one of the most detrimental individuals who could be in the ‘job’ so I would enthusiastically take a roll of the dice with someone else. I’d say 9 “rolls” out of 10 would lead to at least a slightly better outcome so I would take those odds

Why does it wait for the whole phrase to finish before translating? Surely it could start after a second or two was buffered and allow near realtime babelfishing. Surely it could also do it in their voices once it had a big enough sample. :D

Hiya. That is generally not how language is processed. First of all, the syntax of languages differs greatly, for example English is Subject Verb Object so we figure out who's doing a thing at the start of a sentence, and find out what it's been done to at the end. This differs from languages like Korean wherein you don't figure out who's doing something until the end. This can pose a challenge to realtime translation, as to the other listener your sentences would sound unnatural. Furthermore, the greatest accuracy for the sentence, accounting for homonyms etc, will be once all of the inputs are collected, the correct transforms applied, optimizations created and then rendering.  TLDR; Fast realtime = less accurate. Product demos require accuracy or people will tear you apart for even the smallest trifles, so slow and accurate is better here.

Notice how human translators also require a sentence or two of 'buffer'. If a human can't do it without a buffet, I doubt a machine can do a decent job of it either.

No, that's not how translations work. The issue is there isn't a one to one mapping of symbols (whether audio words or text) when converting one language to another. This is the benefit that attention transformers have for translation, they can recall and place values in the correct order, but you have to see the whole message to do that. There will always be a buffer so long as languages have different noun-verb-adjective-etc orders.

Just recently I was wondering if it was possible to convey tone in generated speech. Obviously, text-to-speech would have some problems, but maybe speech-to-speech would be the way to do it. i.e. Say something sarcastically, and the translation will be sarcastic.

The biggest issue is that they've started a trend and now most probably all the other AI/ML major forces will stop releasing their findings or at least restrict what gets published. It would probably happen sooner or later but it's pretty ironic it started with OpenAI

Ultimately the fact that even simple details like parameter size aren't being revealed shows how little moat they have. No doubt they've done their polishing and improvements but there's no secret sauce that's being done here that can't be replicated in a few months tops. We've had more efficient attention for a while now. The answer still seems to be Bigger Scale = Better Results. There are bigger hurdles here like cost and data.

Yeah, that is my read too. It's a bigger, better, more expensive GPT3 with an image input module bolted onto it, and more expensive human-mediated training, but nothing fundamentally new.  It's a better version of the product, but not a fundamentally different technology. GPT3 was largely the same way--the main thing that makes it better than GPT2 is size and fine-tuning (i.e. investment and product work), not new ML discoveries. And in retrospect, we know that GPT3 is pretty compute-inefficient both during training and inference. Few companies innovate repeatedly over a long period of time. They're eight years in and their product is GPT. It's time to become a business and start taking over the world as best as they can. They'll get their slice for sure, but a lot of other people are playing with this stuff and they won't get the whole pie.

At this point LLaMA is far more exciting imo. Considering it works on consumer hardware is a very big deal that a lot of VC/PM crowed on Twitter are not realizing.  It feels like OpenAI is going completely closed too early.

No. GPT2 did not have multi-task fine-tuning and RLHF. Even GPT3 is pretty bad without these two stages of training that came after its release.

Exactly - we can’t be 100% certain of course - but all signs point to the fact that their success is primarily driven not by significant technical innovation but by data engineering, collection and scaling.  For speech - where say whisper is concerned - I have enough background to state this pretty confidently, but is he very very surprised to find out that there is some dramatic new tech driving gptx now, rather than data engineering.  Whisper is “good” but it’s also insanely bloated and slow.  Those are all engineering problems which are much easier to solve in general by throwing resources at the problem. This explains their behavior well as well.  I think they were surprised themselves at the success of a couple of these - particularly chatgpt and this flipped the “don’t be evil switch” into “infinite greed mode”. If true the best solution would be a Mozilla style approach to expand curated data sets, couple with general funding for compute.

The key question is if any innovation is even necessary for AGI, or if it's all just a matter of scaling and refining. If it isn't, the fact that OpenAI doesn't "innovate" won't matter.

I think it also depends a lot on how you define AGI.  If you showed ChatGPT to anyone in 1975 this would 100% be considered AGI for all intents and purposes.  In terms of naturalness and general ability to answer a truly vast array of questions, it’s honestly more intelligent than most of humanity already.  All of humanity if we refer to the breadth of its knowledge.  Of course it’s still bad at “non LM” tasks like math.  But so are most people.  And that will be fixed within 2 yrs I’d guess.  It doesn’t have agency yet; but people are already hacking that on as well.  There’s lots of work in embodiment too.   Is it todays AGI target? No I guess not.  But that target is endlessly moving.  Is it good enough to disrupt modern society in a significant way?  I think yes it is.

Exactly this. I think MS investment came too early for them. AI is in very early stages and there’s a very long road to travel still and whoever tries to do it behind closed doors will fail to keep up pretty quickly. Just look at Apple, unfortunately OpenAI is headed the same way.

Is it?  Are you sure we are not near endgame?  Just a couple more generations and the plots suggest a system about as good at working on AI design as the top 0.1 percent humans.  (That system is going to need a lot of weights and a lot of training data) We are at top 20 percent right now and AI "thinking" has inherent advantages.

Realistically only the big tech companies with deep pockets could compete with OpenAI. Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, etc. There is a pretty big moat between OpenAI and all the small startups that have no where near the scale to build an AGI.

It won't end it, but it will slow it down and result in a "tiered" system. The Big Boys will have top-of-the-line AIs and the rest of us will have previous-generation ones to play with. I expect that was already going to be the case, there will be big three-letter-agency projects going on behind closed doors to build their own AIs regardless of whether OpenAI and its ilk remained open. Still disappointing, though, even if it was expected.

Actually, now you have me curious, are all of DeepMind's latest developments open source?  I thought they were pretty secretive about a few models as well, in which case OpenAI wouldn't be the first.  Of course, it would still be more egregious for OpenAI, given their name and supposed mission. On an unrelated note, I'm reminded of an interesting fact I learned a while back about the Allied efforts to crack the Enigma code.  Right at the beginning in 1932 the Polish cryptographer Marian Rejewski was able to construct an Enigma machine from scratch almost entirely using intercepted messages.  I wonder if we could similarly devise some tests to reverse engineer the architecture of an LLM based on its responses.

Might not be able to get at the underlying architecture any time soon, but getting most or at least a large chunk of the data used for fine tuning from a model should be pretty easy according to the Stanford Alpaca fine tune of LLaMA 7b, as discussed by Eliezer Yudkowsky on Twitter

Yeah, seems like a "tragedy of the commons" situation.  If one company acts in its own self-interest and stops sharing information while all others continue, then that company gets an advantage. But if every company uses that same logic and acts in its individual self-interest, then the entire field slows down and they all lose collectively.

I'm surprised it happened so late to be honest, sharing research for free in capitalism system from for profit companies in a zero sum game while feeding your competition was an anomaly. Now they are sitting on models that soon will be literally worth billions of USD.

 It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.

There is precedent for extracting training data from LLM without the training set, dunno if it would work for gpt4 tho: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805 I guess it's hard to say who would sue but I still think there is a good case. NLL loss is equivalent to MDL compression objective, and compressing an image and selling it almost certainly violates copyright (not a lawyer tho lol...) mathematically, LLM are at least to some extent performing massive scale flexible information compression. If you train and LLM on one book and sell, you're stealing. Should it be different just bc scale? I dunno but I personally don't think so

Is there any legal precedence to argue that training on copyrighted data actually violates that copyright? I genuinely don't know. If I was OpenAI, in this hypothetical law suit, I would make the argument that they're not actually selling the copyrighted data. They're doing something akin to taking a book, reading it, and acquiring the knowledge in it, then applying it. So it would be akin to saying you cant read a textbook on how to build a thing and then sell the thing you build. (Don't misunderstand, I'm not saying that that's what an LLM actually does, but that's what I would say to defend the practice)

So it would be akin to saying you cant read a textbook on how to build a thing and then sell the thing you build. (Don't misunderstand, I'm not saying that that's what an LLM actually does, but that's what I would say to defend the practice)  
 Is there any legal precedence to argue that training on copyrighted data actually violates that copyright?  No, and it's explicitly legal in Europe. And I guess Japan. US banning it would be hilarious, maybe EU would actually win at AI (because US inexplicably decided to quit the race) https://storialaw.jp/en/service/bigdata/bigdata-12  Although copyrighted products cannot be used (downloading, changing, etc.) without the consent of the copyright holder under copyright laws, in fact, Article 47-7 of Japan’s current Copyright Act contains an unusual provision, even from a global perspective (discussed below in more detail), which allows the use of copyrighted products to a certain extent without the copyright holder’s consent if such use is for the purpose of developing AI. Grasping this point, Professor Tatsuhiro Ueno of Waseda University’s Faculty of Laws has characterized Japan as a “paradise for machine learning.” This is an apt description.  Good luck to "artists" in their quest to somehow stop AI from happening.

Yeah I see your point. But if model outputs are considered original, I don't see how anything can be copyright. Let's say I want to sell avengers. I train a diffusion model that takes pairs (movie frame, "frame x of avengers") text-image pairs, plus maybe some extra distractor data. If training works perfectly, I can now reproduce all of avengers from my model and sell it (or maybe train a few models that do short scenes for better fidelity). How is that different from stable diffusion or GPT? Do I own anything my model reproduces just bc it "watched the movie like a human"?  
There is precedent for extracting training data from LLM without the training set, dunno if it would work for gpt4 tho: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805 I guess it's hard to say who would sue but I still think there is a good case. NLL loss is equivalent to MDL compression objective, and compressing an image and selling it almost certainly violates copyright (not a lawyer tho lol...) mathematically, LLM are at least to some extent performing massive scale flexible information compression. If you train and LLM on one book and sell, you're stealing. Should it be different just bc scale? I dunno but I personally don't think so  
Why do you equate training models with stealing? And what is it stealing, if it is not reproducing the original text - we can ensure that it won't regurgitate the training data in many ways. For example, we could paraphrase the original data before training the model, or we could train the model on the original data but filter out repeated ngrams of length >n. GPT-3 had a 45TB training set on 175B weights, that's 257:1 compression ratio while lossless text compression on enwiki8 text is around 6:1. There is no space to store the training data in the model. Can you steal something you can't carry with you or replicate?  
 Why arent they being sued too? Is it right to privatize public data that was used without consent in an LLM, which no one could even have predicted would exist 5 years ago to even give consent?  They don't provide their training data, so we don't even know. So you would have to sue them on the belief that they used some of your copyrighted material and then hope that you are proven right during discovery. Who would sue them? Stable Diff is sued by Getty Images, who have the financial power to do that. OpenAI is not some small start up anymore. Suing OpenAI at this point means you are actually going up against Microsoft. Nobody wants to do that. At best you could maybe try a class action lawsuit, arguing there is a class of "writers who had their copyright violated", but how will you ever know who belongs to that class  
I mean all you really need to do is provide a compelling case to the judge and you get discovery, so youd be able to figure out if your data is in the stolen set, and in fact if anyone else's data is too.

There was some noise about Copilot replicating licensed code, maybe a lawsuit. But in general, unlike image generation, people don't prompt as much to imitate certain authors. That's how I explain the difference in reactions.  
I still dont understand how stable diffusion gets sued for their open source model but openai, which almost certainly used even more copyright data, get to sell gpt. Why arent they being sued too? Is it right to privatize public data that was used without consent in an LLM, which no one could even have predicted would exist 5 years ago to even give consent?  
 Why arent they being sued too?  1) Ambulance chasing lawyers would rather go after the smaller fish first, win/settle with SD, and then (hopefully) establish a precedent that they can then use to bang on OpenAI's door. 2) OpenAI's lack of disclosure around their data sets is (probably by design) going to make suing them much harder.

Also, I guess worthwhile to point out-- OpenAI is being sued on the codex/copilot side.   I neglected to cover this in my original response because, at this point, it seems like the legal arguments are somewhat different from the "core" complaints re:SD about (to use a layman's term) "intellectual theft".  The copilot lawsuit right now seems to be a more obvious and narrow (at least for now) set of complaints that seems to largely hinge on violating open source licensing in systematic ways. That said...the cases here are all quite early, so maybe the SD & copilot cases turn out to turn on the same fundamental legal issues.

Honestly, I have asked the question myself multiple times. Granted, I live in the EU thus GDPR hits us harder. But apparently Google, Microsoft etc. can just ignore it with their large models. When working with data generated by humans, I had to talk for quite a long time with the legal department, specialized lawyers (and burned a good amount of money for that since they were billed highly for every 5min period). They made it clear: If the user didnt explicitly accept somewhere that a model could be trained with their data for a specific purpose, we were not allowed to touch it. And it had to be specific. "We use your data for analytics" wasnt enough. The impossible challenge was exactly what you said in your last paragraph: Old users didnt accept this form when they gave us their data 5 years ago. So were not allowed to use their data ever. After finishing everything with legal, we then had to wait a few months to collect new data from users that accepted those forms. But hey, just scrape Twitter and other websites and apparently you are gucci (if you are large enough).

Why is it confusing? Without disclosing the sourced dataset, we cannot speculate how they arrive at a certain solution, let alone sue them. OpenAI is learning from Stability AI's 'mistake' of disclosing the training data.

What I find most irritating is that as someone who does work in ML, but I would like to work more directly on sota models, suddenly it creates this information wall around each lab.  Meaning unless I can join the staff of OpenAI, Deepmind, or Facebook AI research directly - all of which have very high hiring bars that are likely now as high as quant right now or higher - I will not even know what the cutting edge is. These tiny elite few (a few k people max) are the only ones in the know.

Correct. This completely shoots themselves in the foot long term, as the more restrictive they are the slower their future progress. Open collaborative research, even if not open end products, is an entirely different ecosystem from closed research and closed products. I have to wonder if there's been pressure at a state level. A lot of people are focused on what was going on with Meta as an open competitor as what's behind this, but also in the recent news have been Chinese efforts to catch up. AI development has already become a proxy arms race (i.e. MS controlling drones with a LLM), and it may be that funding sources or promises relating to regulatory oversight at a state level were behind this with the aim not of cutting you off, or Google or Meta even, but of foreign actors. Though I still think that's nearsighted, as this is arguably the most transformative technology in all of human history, and as such the opportunity costs of slowed progress are as literally unfathomable as the potential costs of its acceleration.

One possible solution is to open / start an elite state-funded agency that explicitly focuses on ML / AI, funded by tax dollars - and where all the produced work is open source. Think of it like academia on steroids.  You'd need a budget large enough to pay a salary that falls between Academia and SOTA companies - I mean, the best thing would be to match the salaries of those companies, but that's just a pipe dream. And enough funds to be competitive on the research side (infrastructure, etc.).  Agencies like NASA, ESA, etc. have multiple billion dollar annual budgets.

The rubber is finally meeting the road on this issue. Honestly, given the economic stakes for deploying these models (which is all any corp cares about, getting these models to make money) this was going to happen eventually. This being closed sourced "rushed" (for the lack of a better term) models with little transparency. I would not be surprised if this gets upped to an even further extreme; I can imagine in the not so far future we get "here's an API, it's for GPT-N, here's it's benchmarks, and thats all you need to know."  And to be frank, I don't see this outlook improving, whatsoever. Let's say each and every person who is a current member of the ML community boycotts OpenAI. What about the hungry novices/newcomers/anyone curious who have a slight CS background (or less), but have never had the resources previously to utilize models in their applications or workflows? As we can all see with the flood of posts of the "here's my blahblahblah using ChatGPT" or "How do I train LLama on my phone?" variety to any relevant sub, the novice user group is getting bigger day by day. Will they be aware and caring enough to boycott closed modeling practices? Or will they disregard that for the pursuit of money/notoriety, hoping their application takes off? I think I know the answer. ML technology is reaching the threshold that (and I feel sick making the comparison) crypto did in terms of accessibility a few years back, for better or worse. Meaning there will always be new people wanting to utilize these tools who don't care about training/productionizing a model, just that it works as advertised. Right now, I don't think(?) This group outnumbers researchers/experienced ML engineers, but eventually it will if not already.  I hate to be a downer, but I don't see any other way. I would adore to be proved wrong.

Considering the money in play, I wonder how long we should trust those benchmarks. It’s super-easy to memorize the test dataset answers, isn’t it? And the datasets are on the internet so you almost need to just be a little bit less disciplined about scrubbing them and you might memorize them “by accident.”

I think it'll be a bit different. Uber was not profitable in the beginning because the prices were too low, so they could monopolize the market. ​ OpenAI is probably not profitable yet because of the lack of volume, but not because their prices are low. Once the model is trained, inference is cheap.  ​ That doesn't mean they won't raise prices if they ever manage to monopolize this market, of course.

The whole point after they stopped being a non profit is to try to monopolize the market so they can raise prices. Thats how you increase profit and for profit companies want more profit Never in my life have I heard of a large scale company that thinks they have “enough” profit

I hate to be devil's advocate here because I agree with a lot people are saying in this thread. But in reality, GPT-4 is just too good not to use.

It's likely competitors will rise who will use some version of an open-source platform as their competitive edge. Sure for now GPT-N will be a dominant story and OpenAI/Microsoft will be major players while the product is the LLM itself, but eventually someone will think that to compete they should create an open-source model that ties into some platform of service (think Google and Android). All the tech majors have the money to produce a competitor and there is lots of chatter at top universities about mega-grants for creating open-source models. It is sad that OpenAI took this stance, and it is likely they'll have a first mover advantage long-term, but similar to search, OSes, etc... other options will come along

That is what tested Google at first too. They were tempted by advertisers to prioritize their ads as regular search results. With AI, we aren't even gonna have a chance to distinguish, given how opaque the process is becoming.

I can hopefully allay your fears that this scenario is not going to happen. The complete method of how ads and marketing and media operate will change, as to be virtually unrecognizable to today's standards.  
This is the new reality. AI has been in research mode while people were trying to figure out how to make products out of it. That time has come. The community of sharing is quickly going to be a thing of the past as the competition gets more and more cutthroat.  The next step is going to be even worse: integrating ads.

Are you asserting that over the last 30 years no one has used ML in production applications in ways that had a significant impact? Even going back to early CNN work on MNIST which drove early OCR on reading Bank Cheques? Or time series modelling that has been used to detect anomalies  in warning systems. Or stock forecasting. Or weather forecasting? NLP tools that perform sentiment analysis? Or translation? Predictive modelling to drive just in time supply chain operations that under pin the modern global economy? Or using CNNs to drive quality assurance testing at scale for manufacturing processes? Data modelling has been pretty fundamental to a lot of products and industries for a long time. If you think about it the packaging of these modern LLMs as chatbots is realistically a very naive and surface level use case for them.

I doubt it. There will be many AIs to choose from. I think a large portion of the population would rather pay for access than get free access with ads. Someone will cater to that, if not everyone.

By alienating the entire AI community, they can only go so far. I mean even if they were to release the weights of GPT-4 along with details, the AI community would have loved them and they could still profit off from it by deploying these models at scale that I don't think any organization can do. Like in case of whisper, even if they open-sourced the entire stack, them providing those APIs still allows them to profit off from these models. Not to mention the immense amount of free research and development that goes in the open source, they can also benefit from it.

I don't have an issue of them having Whisper APIs in parallel. The issue is with how the outputs cannot be used or something similar when they have scraped content under fair use. About time people used their output under fair use as well. Or they could just halt the free access but they won't.

But what would you do with the weights if released though? You need close to 200k in purchased GPUs just to run inference on the orgy of parameters that GPT4 is.  The model itself and the way research is nowadays done is the problem.

It is not about how easily accessible the open sourced models are. It is about sharing the open-sourced models so those with more resources and capabilities are able to use and improve upon them.

FWIW, if you are an academic researcher (which not everyone is, obviously), the big players closing up is probably long-term net good for you: 1) Whether something is "sufficiently novel" to publish will likely be much more strongly benchmarked against the open source SOTA; 2) This will probably create more impetus for players with less direct commercial impetus, like Meta, to do expensive things (e.g., trains) and share the model weights.  If they don't, they will quickly find that there are no other peers (Google, OpenAI, etc.) who will publicly push the research envelope with them, and I don't think they want to nor have the commercial incentives to go it alone; 3) You will probably (unless openai gets its way with regulation/FUD...which it very well may) see increased government support for capital-intensive (training) research; and, 4) Honestly, everyone owes OpenAI a giant thank-you for productizing LLMs.  If not for OpenAI and its smaller competitors, we'd all be staring dreamily at vague Google press releases about how they have AGI in their backyard but need to spend another undefined number of years considering the safety implications of actually shipping a useful product.  The upshot of this is that there are huge dollars flowing into AI/ML that net are positive for virtually everyone who frequents this message board (minus AGI accelerationist doomers, of course). The above all said... There is obviously a question of equilibrium.  If, e.g., things move really fast, then you could see a world where Alphabet, OpenAI, and a small # of others are so far out ahead that they just suck all of the oxygen out of the room--including govt dollars (think the history of government support for aerospace R&D, e.g.). Now, the last silver lining, if you are concerned about OpenAI-- I think there is a big open question of if and how OpenAI can stay out ahead.  To date, they have very, very heavily stood on the shoulders of Alphabet, Meta, and a few others.  This is not to understate the work they have done--particularly on the engineering side--but it is easy to underestimate how hard and meandering "core" R&D is.  If Alphabet, e.g., stops sharing their progress freely, how long will OpenAI be able to stay out ahead, on a product level?   OpenAI is extremely well funded, but "basic" research is extremely hard to do, and extremely hard to accelerate with "just" buckets of cash. Additionally, as others have pointed out elsewhere, basic research is also extremely leaky.  If they manage to conjure up some deeply unique insights, someone like Amazon will trivially dangle some 8-figure pay packages to catch up (cf. the far less useful self-driving cars talent wars).   (Now, if you somehow see OpenAI moving R&D out of CA and into states with harsher non-compete policies, a la most quant funds...then maybe you should worry...) Lastly, if you hold the view that "the bitter lesson" (+video, +synthetic world simulations) is really the solution to all our problems, then maybe OpenAI doesn't need to do much basic research, and this is truly an engineering problem.  But if that is the case, the barrier is mostly capital and engineering smarts, which will not be a meaningful impediment to top-tier competitors, if they truly are on the AGI road-to-gold. tldr; I think the market will probably smooth things out over the next few years...unless we're somehow on a rapid escape velocity for the singularity.

That's a very cogent explanation and I agree with most of it. The only concern I have is that these LLMS completely obliterate the smaller task specific models on most benchmarks. I wonder how NLP research in Academia would proceed in the short term when you have a competing model but can't really compare against it as the models aren't reproducible

The same way NLP researchers are already doing it: compare against a similarly sized model, demonstrate scaling and let the people with money worry about testing it at the largest scales.

 demonstrate scaling  Although this part can be very hard for researchers.  A lot of things that look good at smaller scale disappear at scale beyond what researchers can reasonably do without major funding. Perhaps someone (Meta?) should put out a paper about how to identify whether a new technique/modification is likely to scale?--whether or not this is even doable, of course, is questionable.

 Perhaps someone (Meta?) should put out a paper about how to identify whether a new technique/modification is likely to scale?–whether or not this is even doable, of course, is questionable.  This is a really interesting thought, but I think this is ultimately a sort of twist on the halting problem. I think we just don’t know what shape new techniques can take or always their scalability until we test it. Our understanding of what AIs perform best at scale is entirely empirical. I think you can sort of reason about some of it, but to really understand where it hits its limits against your metrics you just have to try it.

Yes, but at the same time most reviewers won't demand experiments at that scale as long as a reasonable attempt has been made with the funding you have. Or we'll see a push towards huge collaborations with absolutely massive author lists like we see in e.g. experimental particle physics. It'll be a little disappointing if that happens because part of what makes ML research exciting is how easy it is to run experiments yourself, but even if all the low-hanging fruit is picked things will go on.

In my specific field, Oracle have a closed-source product which is (allegedly) better than the open-source SOTA and we don't bother benchmarking against them because nobody cares about closed-source. There are folk doing PhDs in my faculty who work on NLP tech, but the applications have specific constraints (e.g. data sovereignty, explainability, ability to inspect/reproduce specific inference runs) for sensitive fields such as medicine; GPT and its siblings are interesting to them but ultimately not useful. I wonder if these kinds of scenarios will carve out enough of a protective bubble for other ML work to proceed. It must be scary to be an NLP researcher right now.

Totally.  Implicit in my writeup is a belief that we'll gradually see more LLMs open sourced & with open weights, driven by my #2 (a need for players like Meta to have the ecosystem support them), so the experiments will be pretty reproducible.   But of course even then, the "model" itself may not be practical reproducible (due to $$$).   Many "mature" sciences (astronomy, particle physics, a lot of biology and chemistry, etc.) have similar issues, though, and they manage to (on the whole) make good progress.  And open-weight LLMs is 10x better than what many of those fields contend with, as it is somewhat the equivalent of being able to replicate that super expensive particle accelerator for ~$0.

This was to be expected and comes as no surprise at all. We still live in a world that is characterized by geopolitical tensions. There is hardly an area of technological progress that has more far-reaching implications for the future of humanity than that of machine intelligence. Nations have no interest in making their innovations in these areas available to other nations. If openAI were to continue to open source, the state administration would intervene and take over control. Competition among corporations (and autocratically governed states) will ensure that progress hardly slows down. And because money has to be made, we will be able to use the commercialized products to raise our productivity to entirely new levels. This will also drive innovation in the open source area, although the limit of computing capacity will be very constraining - at least for the foreseeable future.

Completely agree! Even though the GPT4 presentation was incredible, I still felt a bit disappointed, not just for not releasing a worthy paper, but also for the way they say they trained the model, which is based on RLHF. This only means that they could orient their AI wherever they deem "good"

OpenAI went from a company I revered to a company which I now despise. Let’s just hope another group with good enough funding will continue their previous mission statement soon. Though, with the cost of training these large AI models one can only hope that funding comes from somewhere.

While it’s unfortunate that it’s OpenAI of all things, this was unavoidably going to happen as soon as it could be monetized. In the case of Google, Facebook, etc, they’re pouring billions of $$$ into labs that give their results away for free. At some point those companies are going to want a return on their investment, and telling your competitors exactly how to replicate your product isn’t great business sense. The main counterweight to that is that the biggest and brightest people in the industry also tend to be people who want to publish regularly, so if a lab wants the best talent they’ll need to be open to publishing.  What will probably end up happening is that companies continue to publish 90% of their stuff, but keep the 10% “secret sauce”  private.

The NLP company I work for is fully on the hype train and has abandoned pretty much all ongoing active NLP research in favor of just using GPT4 and ChatGPT. It's effectiveness, whatever the source of it may be is undeniable. Which brings me around to my main point - we can hate OpenAI as researchers and engineers but that's not going to stop corporations from wholeheartedly embracing them and giving them even more of everybody's data. Simply put, we cannot hit them where it hurts- on the bottom line.

Next time don't join the herd and jump on the hype train making someone or some company hugely popular. Populism is the cancer of the society in this century. No matter what good product they build, people should always be struggling to prove themselves and get better to maintain the approval of the society, not enjoying fame. I've never cared or talked about OpenAI, never upped the view counts of videos or articles about them, I've only kept reading on Reddit or Wikipedia. At this point, they failed to maintain the approval of the facultative part of the society, but thanks to all the hype they'll continue enjoying that fame and everything, screwing everyone. It's time to stop being a flock of sheep on a societal level, start acting like thinking individuals and destroy populism. Otherwise, future AI will easily herd us. Skepticism is always helpful.

I want to go further than this and claim that it is not sufficient to provide democratized access to AI (in terms of both use and development), but to democratize the decision making process surrounding AI entirely. You hint at this in the post, but I want to make this goal explicit. Here’s an article that discusses different forms of AI democratization.  I completely agree that regular ML industry workers must band together and demand responsibility from our corporations. Ideally, we would reach out to those affected by AI as well — the artists who are in a more precarious situation than ever, the manual laborers behind data labeling, etc — and work together to make sure the technology does not do more harm.

 In this space, the one approach that is horrifying (and the one that OpenAI was LITERALLY created to prevent) is a singular or oligarchy of for profit corporations making this decision for us.  I think it's more horrifying if we all die. I get that this goes against the scientific spirit, but when Szilard and Fermi discovered that cheap graphite could be used as a moderator for nuclear reactions instead of expensive Heavy Water, they didn't publish that discovery because they didn't want everyone to be able to build a nuclear weapon (especially Nazi Germany). Were they in the wrong? I think they were in the right. Telling everyone how to build AIs seems like a very bad idea.

I think ultimately the research lab or company that attracts the best AI talent will stay ahead in this AI race. There’s only so much money you can throw at researchers, beyond a point a researcher is more motivated by being able to share their work with their peers.  AI hasn’t reached a space where it becomes a engineering problem, OpenAI/MS are wrong in assuming that it has imo. There’s still so much fundamental progress to be made and the longer you spend in your closed lab, the more you deviate from open source the more harder and expensive it becomes for you to incorporate the newer ideas from external breakthroughs into your stack.  I think Meta with its investment in PyTorch and having no immediate need to go all in on monetizing their AI investment is in the best place in the industry right now. Google is also in a commanding position but they are unnecessarily reacting to every news from MS/OpenAI.

These individuals probably demanded/demand to publish their work and make sure it was open to some extent, otherwise they would not do it. These people are old-fashioned though, who knows what younger people will decide to do. There are a million honorable mentions (e.g. managers who decide to keep Pytorch open and the founding team, many other open source projects, Linus, Guido van Rossum, and thousands more who changed the world by opening their work), but it's too complicated to gather this info, and I thank them as well.

Why do you think open source development does not face the same safety and security issues, if not more? If say a technology is similar to the car engine in terms of global impact, do you really think it should be open source? Any technology that can be monetized, will be. It takes millions of $ to train huge LLMs, why would any org who invest this much make their efforts public? We had just gotten used to open source, which isn't going to last realistically. The data they trained on is out there for any company interested in open sourcing AI to use. Where are the other players?

How can it be that researchers fight tooth and nail for funding for years and then somebody comes along, stops sharing, and gets rich? ClosedAI mostly just scaled up the work of others. They started disclosing less and less and now they stopped entirely. This is not about being competitive. It's about being at the top and using all others for your own gain.  All we can do is ignore their products, not mention them in our research and cope with them still being able to profit from our work. I mean not that it makes sense to mention or cite them as they are not publishing anything cite-worthy either way.

A "conversation" in the #gpt4 discord: Me: Is anyone on the GPT-4 team working on the distinction between "is" bias and "ought" bias?  That is to say, the distinction between facts and values? NPCs: alignment is a central feature in OpenAI's mission plan Me: But conflating "is" bias with "ought" bias is a greater risk. NPCs: For my understanding, do you have an example where ought bias is apparent? Hypothetical is fine Me: As far as I can tell, all of the attempts to mitigate bias risk in LLMs at present are focused on "ought" or promoting the values shared by society. NPCs: that is how humanity as a whole operates Me: It's not how technological civilization advances though. The Enlightenment elevated "is" which unleashed technology. NPCs: in order to have a technological "anything" you need a society with which to build it, you are placing the science it created before the thing that created it Me: No I'm not.  I'm saying there is a difference between science and the technology based on the science.  Technology applies science under the constraints of values. Me: If you place values before truth, you are not able to execute on your values. NPCs: the two are interlinked, as our understanding grows we change our norms, if you for one moment think "science" is some factual fixed entity then you don't understand science at all, every day "facts" are proved wrong and new models created, the system has to be dynamically biased towards that truth Me: Science is a process, of course, a process guided by observed phenomena and a big part of phenomenology of science is being able to determine when our measurement instruments are biased so as to correct for them -- as well as correct our models based on updated observations.  That is all part of what I'm referring to when I talk about the is/ought distinction. NPCs: then give an example of how GPT4 or any of the models prevent that Me: GPT-4 is opaque.  Since GPT-4 is opaque, and the entire history of algorithmic bias research refers to values shared by society being enforced by the algorithms, it is reasonable to assume that a safe LLM will have to start emphasizing things like quantifying statistical/scientific notions of bias. In terms of the general LLM industry, it is provably the case that Transformers, because they are not Turing complete, cannot generate causal models based on their learning algorithms, there are merely statistical fits.  Causal models require at least context sensitive description languages (Chomsky hierarchy).  That means their models of reality can't deal with system dynamics/causality in their answers to questions/inferential deductions.  This makes them dangerous. You can't get, for example, a dynamical model of the 3 body problem in physics by a statistical fit. That's a very simple example.

I advise companies on AI/ML options and the OpenAI product is so far ahead of anything else in marketing and documentation. This makes it so difficult to present options to clients because OpenAI present themselves very well, whereas nothing else is on par. However, in development and production, there isn't a huge difference. I don't have any suggestions except the observation that OpenAI offer a good product that people appreciate. I'm not a product person so it doesn't motivate me, but some people are only product motivated. Any suggestions on how to talk about AI/ML products would be welcome! (NB: I haven't used GPT4 for anything yet).

Yeah, OpenAI isn't open, the name is a joke, and it would be so fun to know all about what they did, but otherwise this post screams with so much naivety, I don't even know where to start. In no particular order:  Why do you assume, that open sourcing AI leads to any sort of safety in the world? Like, based on the premise that open access = all benefits, would you feel safer if, i don't know, nuclear weapons construction plans were open? "We're [...] trying to capture the interests and goals of all humanity" - if that's your goal, you're wasting your time. There's no single serious issue on which "all of humanity" has the same goals. Even if you could "align AI" and then open source your model, what makes you think you could prevent a malicious player from copying the codes and dismantling all your alignment safeguards, just to do the bad stuff? "the single most transformative technology and societal change that humanity has ever made" - wow. "oligarchy of for profit corporations" - it's already an oligarchy, and not because of opening/closing source codes, but because of the amount of money you need for compute and the amount of data you need. That's the real barrier you won't pass and the reason big boys can share scraps of their knowledge without worrying about competition. What kind of action steps do you propose in order to "get serious about opposing OpenAI", actually?

Sorry, but, how are closed model anything but good for alignment and safety? Don't get me wrong, I love OSS, I spent 3 years of my life working pretty tirelessly on fully open source ML libraries. But let's be reasonable, alignment research hasn't shown great use of open models and the biggest threat as it stands is human actors using models to accelerate and enable very dangerous practices. Models being guarded behind a company (that's worried about being sued, if nothing else) is good. Otherwise, it seems that most alignment/safety people agree delaying capabilities is good. Making SOTA research close will cause divergence and make it increasingly hard to advance the SOTA since now you've reduced the number of people that can improve on it directly to a small fraction of what I'd be before. Would you care to actually lay out a reasonable argument as to why being closed source and not publishing research is bad from this angle? Again, I'm not even agreeing with it being closed overall, but using the safety angel to argue that seems silly.

I think "opposing OpenAI" is politically misguided, as if singling out a company as researchers or consumers has relevance to the industry as a whole or ever proved to work. We should get serious about regulating AI, creating a tangible baseline of due diligence and open reporting for models that operate under risk. Now, is that going to fly well in the research community? Hardly.  On one side regulation would force top players to disclose and open up details or assets that researchers can tap into. On the other side academic research is often run with very light compliance oversight and a risk taking attitude. For example remember that in the Cambridge analytica scandal a group of university researchers was the key middleman in the extraction of massive amounts of private sensitive data from Facebook.

Wanted to say that myself, but first found this comment. No amount of community opposing or boycotting will do anything. AI itself can be a great tool, but there are risks associated with it, we won't be able to fight, if there is no open access to it.

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

No. The whole chatgpt/gpt-3.5 model builds on code-davinci-002 (which is maybe the one tuned for copilot, but I don't think this has been said publicly). So amy prompt to chatgpt is  a prompt to a differently fine-tuned version of copilot (or copilot-like).

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: ``` Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened: Traceback ... ...  Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace: broken.py  1 ...  2 ... ... 11 ...  ``` I would aggregate those lines in a map of file_name: str -> line_numbers: set where you basically do lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

For the fun of it, I asked ChatGPT to generate the solution for creating the output above, and it didn't get it 100% but it's a pretty good start! One of my favorite things is how it implicitly got that it should do sorted(line_numbers) because set does not have a defined iteration order, or how it should make the line numbers right-aligned.  Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can write a Python program that turns a raised exception into the desired output. This code is not complete, but it should give you a good starting point: ``` import traceback def turn_exception_into_output():   try:     # Code that may raise an exception goes here     pass   except Exception as e:     # Aggregate the lines of code surrounding the trace in a map     lines = {} # Get the traceback object tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)  # Loop through the traceback object for t in tb:   file_name, line_number, _, _ = t    # Initialize the set of line numbers for this file   if file_name not in lines:     lines[file_name] = set()    # Update the set of line numbers with the range of relevant lines   lines[file_name].update(range(line_number - 5, line_number + 5))  # Print the error message print("Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:")  # Print the traceback print("\n".join(traceback.format_exception(e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__)))  # Print the relevant lines of code print("\nBased on these lines of code surrounding the trace:") for file_name, line_numbers in lines.items():   print(file_name)   for line_number in sorted(line_numbers):     print("{:>3} ...".format(line_number))  ``` To use this code, you would call the turn_exception_into_output function whenever you want to handle an exception and print the desired output. For example:  try:   # Code that may raise an exception goes here   pass except:   turn_exception_into_output()  You could also use this code as part of a custom exception handler. For example: ``` import sys def custom_exception_handler(exception_type, exception, traceback):   turn_exception_into_output() Set the custom exception handler sys.excepthook = custom_exception_handler ``` With this code, whenever an unhandled exception is raised, the custom_exception_handler function will be called, which will turn the exception into the desired output.

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely.  If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly.   This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

GPS costs pennies to produce this type of output, even with a 100% carbon tax such that the cost of pollution was internalized, it would cost less than a dime. If you're going to be a useful expert reducing waste, you should account for the actual magnitude of the waste before you scold others. This is why half our public will to be environmental was blown on paper straws. The benefit of testing out new ways to use GPT to code faster clearly outweighs the dollars of electricity spent running the model, if you can't see those tradeoffs but instead scold any miniscule use of electricity you don't like, I believe you are a hindrance to saving the planet.  
That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely.  If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly.   This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

 The error message literally explained it to you concisely.   Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.

I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.

If people were constantly crunching an LLM every time they got a stack trace and this was a normal development practice despite it being largely unnecessary.  Then given it is all complete avoidable, would it not be a waste of energy?  It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand.  That's a nonstarter. There are plenty of tasks more efficiently performed by computers. Reading an already very simple stack trace is not one of them.

Nothing wrong with exploring new AI technology.

The hostility from people because they've been asked to even consider the environmental impact is telling.

Is this similar to what Tesla is doing with their vision based depth estimation?  
Yes, this is certainly similar. As far as I understand from Andrej's talk, the vision-based depth estimation in Tesla uses self-supervised monocular depth estimation models. These models process each frame independently and thus the estimated depth maps across frames are not geometrically consistent. Our core contribution in this work is how we can extract geometric constraints from the video and use them to fine-tune the depth estimation model to produce globally consistent depth.

Is this similar to what Tesla is doing with their vision based depth estimation?  
I read the paper yesterday, it's a good read; But it's not applicable because this is an offline approach that's given a full video. Worse, it fine-tunes the neural net to fit it to a single test example. That said, anything offline that (optionally) costs a lot of compute can also be distilled to be online with much less compute, via a variety of means :)

Could the techniques that you use to get temporarily stable and coherent output also be applied to segmentation in order to get robust mattes for objects? If you could run a piece of footage through a system like yours and get out a stable depth plus antialiased segmentation map, that would a very valuable tool in visual effects.

Yep, I think so. There is an active research community on this topic: "video object segmentation". These methods usually involve computing optical flow to help propagate segmentation masks. I think recent methods shift their focus on getting fast algorithms without fine-tuning on the target video. We had a paper two years ago that pushed for fast video object segmentation.  https://sites.google.com/view/videomatch Of course, now the state-of-the-art methods are a lot faster and accurate. It's amazing to see how fast the field is progressing.

Not having read the paper (cardinal sin), is the test-time-training to handle some form of network conditioning? Is there data that could be used in real-time applications for conditioning (e.g., light sensors, individual range sensors, orientation sensors)? I can imagine there is a ton applications for this in real-time.

The depth estimation model they compare to (and are likely using as their first step same as 3d photo inpainting) takes at worst 1 second to run on most modern CPUs. It's really difficult for me to believe that adding the additional geometric constraint ups the compute time this bad. I'm also maybe a tad jaded from having read the 3d photo inpainting repo (another project from the same team) only to realize that out of roughly 3 minutes that it takes, only about 15 seconds are spent on neural nets and most of the rest is millions of mesh operations in pure Python.

You are absolutely correct. I believe that there are alternatives to achieve similar geometrically consistent depth for a video. This is exciting future research. Re: 3D photo inpainting:Yes, the inference is extremely redundant and the implementation is entirely unoptimized at this point. There are many ways to improve runtime performance. We hope the community will further push this forward!

Hey. Thanks for your reply. I hope I didn't come off as too negative. I understand the constraints research code is under and the mere fact of the code being open sourced and available for study is already amazing. Thank you for all the great work your team has been doing. I've already taken one crack at speeding up 3D photo inpainting and intend to take another when I get some time. For the topic at hand, I read through the discussion in the other thread and skimmed through the paper and the runtime makes a lot more sense now. To me it sounds like we're setting up a giant SFM problem with the parameters being the params of the depth model. Since MidasV2 (which I assume you're using) is supposed to be only off by a scale and shift, I wonder if this technique would work by solving only for those params.

Thanks! The issue with a deep neural network is that we need many gradient steps to make the predictions satisfy the constraints (and therefore the slow speed at this point). We hope that further development in deep learning will help address this problem.

 See dense reconstruction demo   See dense reconstruction demo  Thanks, Jiawang. Yes, we are aware of your work (see the citation and the discussion in the paper). Pre-training the depth estimation network with geometric constraints is a very interesting idea. However, at test time, the depth prediction of video frames remain inconsistent (as there are no longer constraints). This inconsistency issue is amplified when we work with regular cellphone videos in the wild (as opposed to a closed world like the KITTI dataset).  That being said, I believe having models with efficient runtime like your approach is critical for wider adaptation, but there are still several steps we need to solve to get there.

Hi Jia-Bin, thanks for your reply. I agree with you. Only CNN prediction is not sufficient to achieve the globally consistent results, where a post-refinement is necceary. Actually I also try to do that recently. Congratulations for your nice work, and many details really inspire me. Look forward for your further improvement.

If I understand the paper correctly, they pre-train the model using COLMAP and Mask R-CNN to get a semi-dense depth map for any frame. They then improve the depth maps at test time by randomly sampling frames from the video and re-training the model using "spatial loss" and "disparity loss", which are defined in the article. Mask R-CNN is traditional, supervised learning for object segmentation. COLMAP and this model appear to be unsupervised, since there are no reference depth maps being used for the loss. Instead, the loss for COLMAP and this model appears to be based on whether frames which capture similar regions of the scene have similar depth maps. At least, that's what I understood from the paper – someone smarter than me will hopefully come along and clear things up.

Yes! It is correct! So we can also think about the test-time training as "self-supervised" as there is no manual labeling process involved.

 be able to read and understand a paper like that. Please don't punish someone for asking basic questions - everybody is on a different part of a learning journey.  The test-time training in our work is "supervised" in the sense that we have an explicit loss. However, you may also view this as "self-supervised" as all the constraints from the video are automatically extracted (i.e., no manual labeling process involved).

As a VFX artist, this is a pretty cool improvement to a part of the workflow.  For most tasks a reliable method of improving camera tracking consistency would be enough and extremely useful. So much of my time is spent hand adjusting tracking points to improve the solve.

These results are pretty impressive. How accurate is this method or in general the latest depth estimation methods for far away objects? How do they work in texture less regions?

We didn't have an explicit comparison with others on far away objects.  For textureless regions, you can see the visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art algorithms here:  https://roxanneluo.github.io/Consistent-Video-Depth-Estimation/supp_website/pages/depth_TUM_comparison.html (The quantitative comparison is in the paper.)

Very interesting and cool work. Minor nit: in the second video (with the cat), the particles are never occluded by the cat or by anything in the scene. Kind of weird to include them given that they could just be overlayed. But the relighting is nice.

 But the relighting is nice.  Ha! good catch! After checking the video again, there is actually a tiny pink particle that was occluded by the cat's face. But you are right, we probably can demonstrate this better by making it more explicit.

[R] Consistent Video Depth Estimation (SIGGRAPH 2020) - Links in the comments.
I wonder, why is it that these learning-based monocular depth estimation papers always attempt only scale-invariant depth? A NN should be capable of estimating scale to some extent in a monocular setting based on things like people, furniture, doors etc, especially when given a whole video like here. Absolute scale would be required for most practical uses, and it would be interesting to know how well it would perform compared with stereo methods.

While I do agree that some (maybe most) of the effects are quite doable without depth information from the video, they still need depth information input from humans. And, of course, it's just a demonstration, a proof of concept. The paper is about machine learning and the method used after all, not about video effects.

Here I'm also doing Stroke/Hover prediction: everytime the user raises his index finger, I'm also predicting whether he wants to stroke, or if he just wants to move his hand. I'm using a recurrent neural network over the finger speed to achieve this. Even with a small dataset of ~50 drawings (which I did myself) it works reasonnably well

Oh I see , really did not get what you meant by pencil up/down earlier. Will check out the code later , but as far as i think the task of capturing and plotting the pixels can be done using open cv too. so i assume model predicts the spaces after you feed it all the points plotted. So i would think this project of your can be extended to improve the quality of handwritten notes (it usually is the case that people have bad handwriting ). And then use somekind OCR to convert it to typed text .. (I may be wrong about many things i will go through the repo in detail and edit my reply later)

Yes, sadly I didn't manage to get good performance in real time, I had to use bidirectionnal LSTM  
On the video there is very little delay between the Predict button being pressed and the result appearing. Would it be possible/feasible to run prediction every second or so? So that the latest strokes aren't processed, but as you keep drawing, the earlier parts of your drawing turn into the cleaned up version. I guess it wouldn't be as magical as purely real time prediction, but I think even this might look pretty cool. Of course, this is already really cool. I didn't expect the final version to be so clean.

Seems super useful to me, especially "two more papers down the line." Stylus could be rendered obsolete if you've got a camera (i.e. most phones), as any surface or no surface at all becomes writeable upon. Any screen becomes a touch screen, any surface can be marked up for say a construction project providing easy modeling, measuring, etc. I don't know, I think drawing in space has been on a lot of people's wish list for some time. Between this and 3d printing pens, I'm excited for the future.

Got spot. In the low FPS version, hockey sticks also disappear multiple times, which would not happen with a normal footage. This is really fishy. Not trusting this.  
Why does the hockey stick clip through the guy even in the low 15 FPS view? Surely that content should just be real frames right?  
I think they interpolated that clip from real footage, then de-interpolated down to 15 fps.  Why they did that, I have no clue.

Because it makes the results look better. Any artifacts that are missing from the original interpolation are also missing from the de-interpolated “reference footage”, so the interpolated 60 FPS looks perfect. I’m weary of these results. Would love a demo website that we can upload other footage to and see how it works in general.

Which hockey stick ? The stick carried by 17 Novak is simply rotated in this hands so it becomes side-on.  
Watch it frame by frame, when it goes side on it literally disappears. It should still exist but it was clipped out. This indicates the input footage was tampered with which makes me question the generalizability of the results  
Why does the hockey stick clip through the guy even in the low 15 FPS view? Surely that content should just be real frames right?  
Looks like a video compression artifact to me - it's likely taken from an online video not a broadcast-quality original. It's a poor choice of shot anyway as we have enough slow-mo technology now to capture the proper frames in sports. (If only youtube would stop telling broadcasters to drop half the frames when deinterlacing.)  
Github: https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2020-RIFE Our model can run 30+FPS for 2X 720p interpolation on a 2080Ti GPU. Currently our method supports 2X/4X interpolation for video, and multi-frame interpolation between a pair of images. Everyone is welcome to use this alpha version and make suggestions!  
Hey I was wondering if roughly 2s/it for a RTX 2080 with an i7-7700k sounds about right speed wise for  a video that is 720p? It has taken about 30mins so far for half of the process to complete. I am just looking for confirmation if my setup is working correctly or if maybe it is falling back to use the CPU. Thanks.

Now combine this with image upscaling, and we can stream movies at 480p @ 15fps, and have them upscaled to 4k at 120fps! And we can do the same for gaming too! Soon, yes, even your old dusty playstation 2, is going to be capable of 4k gaming! ... As long as the output is fed through 3 algorithms, frame rate increase -> image resolution upscale -> then a 'realism' AI image filter to the graphics to upgrade it. /jk-ish

Yes it’s a thing. It’s far from perfect but it does ‘work’ in some manner of speaking. You are right that you’re inventing detail, but hopefully statistically likely and locally plausible detail. Naturally there are ways to measure against real data various different ways in which these upscaling algorithms work and don’t work.

I wouldn't say it is "inventing" detail, it is using information from previous and future frames to fill in some details. However, trying to go from 480p at a low framerate to 4k at a high framerate is not going to really look that great because you're trying to fill in too fine of details with too little data.

I’m not talking about frame interpolation I’m taking about image upscaling. Anyway it’s obvious that ‘inventing’ is just ELI5 language for exposition purposes.

My perspective is as a user who dabbles in the theory. It works more than good enough if you aren't looking for artifacts, or simply don't care, the gains are simply worth more than the losses. Particularly cost. Going from 480p to 4k is nearly pointless, but will do a decent 1080p. What is really cool is going from 1080 to 4k. You don't have to own a 4k camera to make 4k content. <$100 camera that can do 1080 @ 60hz, can be upscaled to 4k and 120hz in post. And another version will come out soon enough, it's not like anyone is marrying the output. Not today, but soon, OP's comment won't be hyperbole. But it's still pretty damn useful today.

Is image upscaling really a thing? I mean, from 480p to 4k there're a lot of details the algorithm would need to "invent"  
Yes, but don't expect good upscaling from 480p to 4k. There's an inherent issue that the lower resolution contains less information. You can really see this in face upscaling where they go from 32x32 -> 256x256. People change genders and ethnicity all the time. Eye color is a crap shoot every time. The problem is that the information isn't really stored (you generally can't even see an eye clearly in a 32x32 image).  Now you're probably saying that this doesn't matter because I'm talking about really small images and the gp is talking about 480, well I'm just trying to say that you shouldn't expect the same things in 4k like how you can read text in the background. If you did that upscaling and tried to read background text you'd get gibberish or a reconstruction that is not trustworthy. But for macro objects, yeah, you're probably fine.

Yeah, checkout ESRGAN, and /r/gameupscale. 4x enlargement of single images is pretty easy to do a good job of, which is 1080p to 4k. Or 720p to 1440p.

Jokes aside, there is a side of this that worries me. Algorithms are not magic. They cannot conjure up missing information, they have to inject information from outside the original data. Upscaling and video interpolation are mostly innocuous and valid applications. But if the technology starts to get used on things like security footage, it could give dodgy information a deceptive veneer of clarity. And that’s even before intentional deep-fakery.

In games, there are 2 components that an increase in frame rate results in: 1. smoother visuals, and 2. more responsive inputs. AI-based framerate improvements can probably only improve upon the first, limiting their effects.

In VR gaming maintaining frame rate is way more important than traditional gaming. Timewarping is the basic method to ensure the player always has a frame to see even if the game can't generate a frame in time.  ASW (Asynchronous Spacewarp) is a more advanced method using motion vectors interpolation (like ops video) and has benefits over traditional time warping because it isn't limited to generating new frames based on only rotational changes. It's still improving but there are fundamental differences/problems using it for gaming compared to movies. For movie the next frame already exists so making inbetween frames doesn't require predicting the future. When playing the next frame is dependent on the game state of the future which is driven by user input. We get such great results in movies because we don't have to predict the future.

Having seen the first two Hobbit movies in 48fps in the theater and watched a bit of Gemini Man in 60fps on the UHD Blu-ray, I understand exactly why most of the film industry sticks to 24fps. 24fps hides so many flaws (makeup, props, and set pieces are much more obvious and easily make many shots look "cheap") and seemingly makes the brain imagine something so much more fantastical than the actual visual information it's given. There's also the fact that higher framerates require much brighter lighting in general to reduce any chance of unintended blur, which can drastically increase production time and significantly change the initially intended look of a film... or require much more post-production to achieve the vision of the director. If animation started using more 48/60/120fps, I'd fully understand as it's much easier to control the environment and everything in every shot... but live action is either going to take a while to "warm" to the idea of HFR or never fully adopt anything higher than 24fps as a standard. I guess we'll see if others take the lead from James Cameron after Avatar 2 is finally released, but we're more likely to just see a "gimmicky" period of more movies at high frame rates just like there was a big post-Avatar 3D boom.

On some level I can agree, it may change how a something feels. There's some potential value in a lower framerate. The impact each frame gives can change, and some low framerate content like Anime is made with regard to low framerate. (Not that anime shouldn't be higher framerate, but it's hard to interpolate and work to draw 60+ fps is very expensive.)  However, on the other hand, it can really improve many things. I was at a friends place and we watch a movie on the TV and I could see interpolation artifacts on a movie (mostly quick action scenes, were camera flicks around, so not that big of deal) but turning the feature off made it near unwatchable. I watch movies all the time on my PC, but that playback was painful.  And I love making some content high framerate, just because it's smoother. From my own experience, the real flaws show with small objects, large movements of the frames/camera/objects, and rapid changes.  I tried some interpolation on gameplay, and with mouse and keyboard in a first person shooter, the interpolation can't keep up at all. Noticed things like grenades, small ones, that might move relatively far with just one frame at even 60 fps, is going to be a problem for motion estimation methods.    Also, yeah, SVP at least uses motion vectors iirc, but not machine learning. I think such methods are faster, and results are near as good as a decent machine learning network. (Perhaps better since TVs do so well without significant artifacts)

While the process is very cool and has a lot of uses beyond cinema, I personally think it makes films shot at 24/30 FPS look like a soap opera. 24 FPS (and to a lesser extent 30) has such a classic film feel to it. I hope they don’t start going back and messing with old films just because they can. End rant.

No, reliable video frame interpolation has been around for at least 10 years now (i.e. Twixtor) but it's discrete algorithm-based not AI-based, and it's not free. The end-result is all the same. They don't produce reliable results for fast-moving objects and scenes.

the movement looks weirdly fake in the upscaled version idk. I like the feel of the lower framerate for cinema. For sport I see that the higher framerate makes more sense.

Nvidia did it 3 years ago https://www.dpreview.com/news/5843863433/nvidia-slow-mo-video-ai saying "this isn't the first time something like this has been done before" But I guess the main advantage here is that it's faster than other algorithms. Though PSNR shouldn't be used anymore to present results (1st plot). Also I'm not sure that you're using FP16, you could probably try that to speed up even more the computations. You used SSIM and you should try LPIPS. I manage to see some artifacts on this video and I guess these examples aren't random and were chosen because that's where the algorithm worked the best. To be used in the real world (youtube / tv / film industry), having a fast algorithm is necessary but there probably shouldn't be almost any artifacts for all kind of footages. If I had to wait x2 but with 0 artifacts, I would probably try a slower version.

Tbh I was never a fan of 60fps. The only time I shoot 60fps is if I plan on reducing the speed. It is too smooth and clean that it no longer looks real. Our eyes catch it and you get "something is off" feeling

Yet 60 fps is closer to the reality than 25 fps. I submit it is because you have used to 25 fps videos for your whole life. It could also have something to do with the effect called "uncanny valley".

 Yet 60 fps is closer to the reality that 25 fps.  That's debatable. Our eyes actually see between 30 to 60 frames per second and that is an estimation. There is no real way to test the speed of the eye in relation to film because that's not the way our eyes are wired.   I submit it is because you have used to 25 fps video for your whole life.  While that is true for most people including me,, I'm a filmmaker and have been studying the fps debate since lord of the rings 48 fps spectacle. What we got is different theories and where our eye stands. To your point on the "uncanny valley", that hits it on the head. When I see something move fast with no motion blur it looks very fake to the point it is unnerving for me. Going back to the lord of the rings example, my class was split in half. Our result came to that it was a stylistic choice.  Side note: Gamers are a different bred where most games start at 60fps+. The psychology is different than filmmakers

I mean the reality is like infinity FPS and 60 fps is closer to infinity than 25. What we feel of it in the eye may happen at some lower frequency, but then again people are easily able to distinguish between 30 fps game or 60 fps game.. No matter what digital processing tricks are used, in general case (but not in all cases, like slowly moving objects). Are people really able to distinguish between material that has been downsampled to 30 fps from 60 fps, instead of directly filmed to 30 fps? I suppose if it was just about motion blur then it would be easy to fix with some digital signal processing even preserving the frame rate.. and I have doubts it would do it. For example one comment I remember hearing is that the legs seemed to move "too quickly" in LoTR HFR, while, I imagine, the legs were moving at exactly the correct rate. Being a film maker you might be aware of the (old) idea of supporting variable frame rate in movies: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/siggraph-2012-douglas-trumbull-showscan-variable-frame-360410 . I imagine that would be best of both worlds. In particular I would enjoy experiencing the jarring 24 fps panorama scrolls in higher frame rate—although this is something that automatic interpolation handles well. In my opinion the bigger the change of frames in your field of view is, the worse the low frame rate feels. It also remains to be seen if the current gaming generation will also start to prefer higher frame rate videos due to exposure you mention—not just games, but Youtube also supports 60 fps. I have a 180 degree stereo VR camera and I feel 30 fps just doesn't cut it when putting the VR glasses on. In my case I need to choose between 5.6k/30 fps and 4k/60 fps and most often I choose the latter, even if the picture quality would be a bit better in the former.

It all really comes to style and which one you are more comfortable with. Back in the day technology and hardware were a big driving force behind innovation as they were limited on what they can offer (pal vs ntcs, 220v vs 110v, etc). Nowadays the tech is way ahead and hardware a bit behind but nonetheless advanced enough to where there are a plethora of options. The best distributors can do now is be generic enough where their bottom line doesn't take a hit if they ever go to a niche market. Everything pretty much works now, the question now is if we can do it should we do it?

The eye see a lot higher fps than 30-60. It is easily 144hz or more  before it becomes hard for the average person to pick between two screens showing different fps

That was a really good paper, thanks. I'd be interested in if it would be possible to remove the search component from the method, in order to speed it up. Like, if you could train a model to go from the low resolution images to the latent space of the StyleGAN that produces a good result.

I have to admit that I haven't thought outside faces in this. But I still can't see what the benefits/scenarios would be where you got a totally different up-scaled image than you were supposed to? Isn't this just rendering a new face depending on the color scheme of the LR image? It's fun, yeah, but what are the benefits?  
[R] Wolfenstein and Doom Guy upscaled into realistic faces with PULSE
At some level this is kind of interesting, but is it just me, or would it not have been much more interesting to show the ground truth image as well ? I may have missed it, if so I'm sorry, but from what I can see in the examples there are LR images being up-scaled, and then down-scaled again. As such, very cool, but depending on the algorithm used, the up-scaled images are in many cases very different. How interesting is it really to up-scale a LR image to something that doesn't look like the original image ? I want to see how close it is to the original image. ​ I mean, that would be interesting for images that are not this LR, but maybe just a bit better to actually make them somewhat usable.

Yeah okay, I just scimmed through the paper. I'm not that much into imaging, in particular this. But I just don't see a use case for this ? I mean, what is the idea of up-scaling a LR image, if the up-scaling is not even close to what it is supposed to look like ? As I said, it would make sense if the LR image are not that low as in this case, but in these examples I really can't see the benefit ?  But maybe that is in regards to more advanced use cases...

There are actually quite a lot of scenarios where the plausibility and quality of the higher resolution result is more important than the accuracy.   Even if we limit the thinking to faces, you can see its utility in upscaling stock images. The user doesn't care whether the identity of the person gets lost. They just want a perfect, high resolution image of a matching face, rather than a slightly warped, blurry, high resolution result that's may be more faithful to the ground truth. But the principles displayed here go well beyond just faces. This would be useful in the context of scenery photographs, and creating 3d models from photos, etc.

I feel you, especially the Doom-guy is so far from the original that it feels more like just taking some random dude with similar face shape and color and saying that this the Doom-guy. Not to say it's not impressive or good work (and I don't really know enough to judge that)!

 I want to see how close it is to the original image  Lots of information is missing in down-scaled image. There's no way to restore the original image.

I am aware of this. That's why I asked, what is the point of all this? If it doesn't work on that low quality images, then show its capabilities on a bit larger/better LR images.

Here's a far more important question: take a photo of Brad Pitt and downsample it to 32 x 32 or whatever the above pictures were. Now, tell me: what's the full space of all high res images that could have been downsampled to produce the same picture of Brad Pitt? Put another way: sin(pi/2) = 1. There are MANY values that have a sin of 1, so how are you supposed to figure out sin-1 (1)? There's no sensible way to say you've matched the ground truth, because there are effectively an infinite number of possible ground truths. You can't really talk about 'accuracy' with a model like this in a rigorous sense, because there's too much information that's being lost. At best you're coming up with one plausible answer of many possible ones. The inverse sin of 1 could certainly have been pi/2. If that's what your model predicts, don't get upset that it didn't guess 5pi/2 instead, it had no way of knowing which was the original. As long as it upscales to someone that looks believably like the super low res Brad Pitt picture, that's as good as you can expect. This problem is fundamentally unsolvable in the way you're wanting.

Inverse pigeonhole principle!  
Inverse pigeonhole principle!  
Yeah, the 'official' math term if you're interested, is 'fibers'. For non-injective functions, you can potentially have multiple inputs leading to the same output. That means each element of the output space has whole subsets for the inverse... all those subsets make a partition of the input space. The elements of that partition are the so-called 'fibers'. the fiber of sin-1 (1) for example is {2kpi + pi/2 | k in Z}, so there's countably infinite possible inputs to get 1. The same is true for an extreme downsampling function like in this one... there's maybe not an infinite number of images that could lead to a given low-res image, but they're still some pretty large fibers, haha. To get a sense of how bad the problem is, all you have to do is downsample a block of text to the point where it's completely unreadable, and then ask how many different english paragraphs (was it even English in the first place?) could have made that vaguely-text like pixelated blur. Can't reconstruct Faust from a few pixels. For anyone who cares, one interesting method to attempt to inverse non-injective functions is Bishop's mixture density networks. Basically you have multiple networks in a mixture model, that together hopefully learn the various elements of the various fibers. Bishop's paper starts with learning to write the letter 'S' for example... Any given horizontal value in the letter might cut through a few different lines, since S doubles back on itself, so that's part of how the MDN-RNN handwriting synthesis paper from 2013 tackled this problem of multiple values in the inverse function (to name a fairly well known example).

lol any chance you could explain foliation/leaves in similar layman's terms as you did here with fibers?   attempting to understand papers by cross-referencing with Wikipedia term definitions kinda starts to lose effectiveness once you start getting into the sets/groups/differential geometry area.

The real question is can you generate a pixelated Brat Pitt from a real Brad Pitt or is he already too low-res.

How does it prevent abuses by trolls?  
Here's an excerpt from the dev "Pseudo-random distribution To prevent one submission with a lot of votes never being able to be replaced, I decided to use a weighted random distribution based on the equation on the right. This formula makes the first few votes matter a lot more than votes on a submission that already has a lot of votes. This gives newly submitted segments a better chance of being sent out to users to get votes. So, most users will get the best submission, but some users will get lesser votes submissions so that they can either be upvoted or downvoted. Submissions with less than -1 votes are ignored entirely.You can read more about my algorithm here."

It costs 0.006€ per summary, so it could absolutely become very expensive. I have a server which fetches the summaries and saves them in a database so I can control how much I want to spend in a month vs how quickly videos are added and avoid calling the api multiple times per video

Ok, but how did you get access to InstructGPT, given that it has never been released to the public, even less so as a pretrained model?

They are called text-davinci-003 and 002 but in reality they are both instruction tuned, thus instructGPTs.  
They are called text-davinci-003 and 002 but in reality they are both instruction tuned, thus instructGPTs.  
To the best of my understanding `davinci` series are 175B parameter models, whereas InstructGPT itself is a 6B parameter model. And to the best of my understanding of the research on the topic, InstructGPT fine-tuning dataset does not contain enough data to properly fine-tune 175B parameter models. As far as I understand,  `text-davinci-003` and `002` are something else entirely and `davinci-instruct-beta` that is mentioned as resulting from the InstructGPT model is 175B and is not the 6B InstructGPT itself.

What's the difference between those and chatgpt?  
That’s an excellent question. In their blogpost, OpenAI calls ChatGPT a “sister” model to InstructGPT, but that’s it. There is no paper, and the only info we have from other public communication is that it’s a 175B variant, based on GPT3.5, so pre-trained with more text and code, and pretty certainly with much more Instruct-like mode fine-tuning and censor models training.

If you look into them more, it's usually just as trivial as being the first to publish a paper about using a model that came out 12 months ago on a less common dataset. It's really more about the grad student's advisor doing them a solid in terms of building their CV than actually adding useful literature to the world.  
Honestly I wish my advisor had done that.  My CS program was alright overall, but the ML professor used the same undergrad material for all his classes and I've kind of been left trying to put together functioning knowledge and a career myself.

Apparently Siraj found the time to learn group theory, topology, and quantum mechanics while making his YouTube "content". I aspire to be just like him!  I will also need later the fact that if C is an arbitrary  orthogonal matrix, then C ⊕ C is both orthogonal and  symplectic. Importantly, the intersection of the  symplectic and orthogonal groups on 2N dimensions is  isomorphic to the unitary group on N dimensions. This  isomorphism allows us to perform the transformations  via the unitary action of passive linear optical  interferometers. Every Gaussian transformation on N  modes (Eq. (7)) can be decomposed into a CV circuit  containing only the basic gates mentioned above.  Errr hold on a moment. This is just a ctrl-C ctrl-V with a s/We/I/g. Even the equation numbers are the same.  We will also need later the fact that if C is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix, then C ⊕C is both orthogonal and symplectic. Importantly, the intersection of the symplectic and orthogonal groups on 2N dimensions is isomorphic to the unitary group on N dimensions. This isomorphism allows us to perform the transformations Ki via the unitary action of passive linear optical interferometers. Every Gaussian transformation on N modes (Eq.

It is ridiculous in this case, but there's not really anything wrong with using "I" if only you did the research. People who say otherwise are just blindly following outmoded dogma. Like people who put two spaces after a full stop, or who say "an historic".

I usually write in passive mode, here that would be  'The fact that C is ortho matrix is needed later, such that C+C is sumplectic.......This allows the transformation K_i .... '

 "an historic"  I am British so by definition am already outmoded and dogmatic, however some of us do still pronounce it 'istoric, so maybe correctly outmoded and dogmatic in this case (blanket statements are dangerous). Also using "We" at all times in scientific writing is more practical: assuming you write both single and multi author papers (perhaps simultaneously), it ensures consistency without imposing mental overhead. Using a mix of singular and plural is far more confusing than using We consistently, and it's pretty embarrassing to have a rogue "I" in a draft when you have multiple authors.

From my experience as an undergraduate, when I would write proofs or work on projects, I was always supposed to use "we" in the proofs or projects, even if I was doing all of the work.  I think that "I" is too presumptuous.  Is this accurate? For example,  "in this section, we prove that A != B".

Using "we" is seen as more inclusive, since it's as if you are including the reader with you in the process, which in turn makes the writing sound less self-centred and presumptuous.

If there is something the scientific community never forgets is plagiarism. All the AI researchers who care about their reputation (ie. everyone) will stay away from him from now on, which means he won't be able to use the reputation of a network to sell himself as an expert and get invitations to events, podcasts, conferences, etc. Not a smart strategy, he's doomed.

He didn't want that, he knows he's a fraud and doesn't have a chance at a legitimate scientific career.  I imagine there is nowhere in the world that would terrify Siraj more than NeurIPS or similar. There will be plenty of marks (to give them an appropriate name) who see his youtube numbers and simply book him for the lucrative contracts.  Snake oil salesmen don't go to lotion conferences. Although I do agree, this is probably going to end up with the people who's work he steals  more actively and publically going after him, which will make his life difficult.

I was very skeptical about him after I watched a couple of his YouTube video. Especially, his live coding session was disappointing. I didn’t understand how he struggled a basic usage of Python. Now I think my skepticism on him seems to be legit.

Yes.  I watched  this video on generating pokemon using a neural network.  I thought it was neat, and so I went to GitHub to check out the repository.  However, at the very bottom of the README, he says that all of the code was written by someone else, and that he was simply providing a wrapper around the code.  After that, I unsubscribed from his channel.  I doubt he has a solid understanding of the things he talks about and only profits from other peoples'  work.

I've watched a few videos back in my early days of ML and was struggling so I just copied the code he wrote ("wrote") and it didn't even work. He copy and pasted someone's code from their GitHub, didn't check it and turned it into a 30 minute video using only the original authors README file. Haven't watched since.

Plagiarism in science, in this day and age, especially, is unforgivable, I'm afraid. It's hard enough for scientists (most struggling with shoestring budgets, if any) to do original research and get it published (often just to keep food on the table); but to plagiarize when you clearly have the means to do better... like I said... unforgivable. Good job exposing it.

I've said this before but Siraj is just the tip of the iceberg. Every company, public personality, consultant, and marketer who dabble in ML all benefit from over-hyping and overselling AI/ML. A large number of ML practitioners are scammers -- perhaps not as obvious as Siraj but still scamming by lying, overselling, and using non-technical peoples naivete to take their money. We need to change the conditions which create an environment for these people to thrive. Unless we do so they will continue to lie... and we will continue to have more Siraj Ravals.

Biologically Inspired Inspired by what? Normally when talking about the life sciences, you describe a specific molecular function or biological process. School of AI Research And peer-reviewed by the ministry of silly walks? I surmise that Phosphorus-31 enables both of these properties to occur within neurons in the human brain. In light of this evidence Surmise: verb: "suppose that something is true without having evidence to confirm it."  Mmmmhh.. My aim is that this will provide a starting point for more research in this space, ultimately using this technology to drive more innovation in every Scientific discipline, from Pharmacology to Computer Science. This is first-year undergraduate writing, what the fuck. The symbology of these transmissions These frequencies can ride each other over a synapse and dendrite city of activity inside the neuron In short "I don't really know what I'm talking about" Despite this huge difference between the neuron in biology and the neuron in silicon, neural networks are still capable of performing incredibly challenging tasks like image captioning, essay writing, and vehicle driving. Despite this, they are still limited in their capability. Which one is it doc? If we can simulate our universe on a machine, chemical, physical, and biological interactions, we can build a simulated lab in the cloud that scales, ushering in a new era of Scientific research for anyone to make discoveries using just their computer. Probably forgot blockchain somewhere in there. More specifically, if we incorporate quantum computing into machine learning to get higher accuracy scores, that’ll enable innovation in the private sector to create more efficient services for every industry, from agriculture to finance. So far his main point was that digital neural networks are rather simplistic compared to in vivo ones, but now it's about accuracy and time complexity?? Now I'm not well educated in quantum-physics, but the above already gives me the impression he is just chaining wikipedia buzzwords and stealing someone elses design to make it sound real?

This is a good example of language models learning shallow heuristics. The model has learned that in English certain pronouns are likely to come before certain words, and as per the example upthread in Turkish, it will even break consistency for this.  Bias like this is a particularly good example of how language models can learn to "cheat" on problems like this. A human translator would use "they", ask for clarification, or infer from other context rather than just guess based on what it's seen before.  Microsoft released a paper a bit ago about math word problems and identified a similar issue with language models learning shallow heuristics.

Yes, you could use "they" because you don't know, but more often than not, they'll end up using "he" or "she" as seems appropriate to the single sentence or fragment they've been given and let the customer tell them that it's wrong. (my experience) So you really can't say the ML is doing a bad job, here, when it's coming up with similar answers to the human. At worst, you can say that if this is all one string input then it should have been consistent within the string.

I'm not saying it's doing that bad a job, this example is pretty much adversarially crafted. Especially since in this case the customer telling them they're wrong is as simple as :%s/he/she/g, it's really not a massive problem in the now for Google. But this is a manifestation of a larger, less sensational, and really interesting problem in NLP where generalist language models learn to mimic rather than produce. This is a good example of that because it's successful... sort of, but clearly awkward. The model isn't just guessing, it doesn't know whether to guess or not.  With all of that said I think if you did want to sincerely talk about AI bias this is the kind of thing you put on your first slide as a hook and spend the rest of your time talking about more measurable things. It's no more biased than its training set is and that's difficult if not impossible to correct. But it gives some good justification for more research on the places where models might make predictions on shallow heuristics, and provide motivation for fixing that (like say knowing that "he" and "she" are in the same word class).

That's what is meant by "shallow heuristic". The model (assuming it is Transformer-based) is not parsing the sentences in any principled way, but has learned what are essentially statistical hacks to infer how a sentence can/should be parsed.  
This is a good example of language models learning shallow heuristics. The model has learned that in English certain pronouns are likely to come before certain words, and as per the example upthread in Turkish, it will even break consistency for this.  Bias like this is a particularly good example of how language models can learn to "cheat" on problems like this. A human translator would use "they", ask for clarification, or infer from other context rather than just guess based on what it's seen before.  Microsoft released a paper a bit ago about math word problems and identified a similar issue with language models learning shallow heuristics.  
I find it ironic, how people are so quick to claim that a statistical algorithm has bias, based on effectively a single image of a few examples. If I replace any of the words that were given with a synonym, then I get the opposite gender (e.g. "clever" is associated with "he", but "brilliant" is "she").

I feel like this is a bit related to the problem of AI not knowing when to say "I don't know". It always has a best guess, because loss functions don't usually allow an "I don't know" answer. Hence you get things like "how many eyes does an apple have? Two" In this case its best guesses are really good ones! (In terms of accuracy anyway.) By the way babies also seem to have this property. They'll always give you an answer. It might make zero sense but they'll give it a try!

Turkish is similar. The pronoun "o" is used for he/she/it. "O güzeldir. O zekidir. O okur. O bulaşıkları yıkar. O öğretir. O yemek yapar..." is translated as "He is beautiful. He is clever. He reads. He washes the dishes. He teaches. He cooks...". I don't know if the selection is arbitrary but apparently the male domination in the translation is a result of a consistency constraint. I tried to translate individual sentences and saw both the feminine version and the masculine one for any sentence (e.g., Both "She is beautiful" and "He is beautiful") with a warning about genders. I also tried with random combinations of sentences. When there are at least two sentences, it always chose "he" (As in the example I gave). Many different attempts, only one exception I observed: The texts which include "O bir hemşiredir" are translated to texts which include "She is a nurse" (For the individual sentence, it notices the gender-specific translation and provide both versions). The translation for "O bir hemşiredir. O bana iğne yaptı." is "She is a nurse. He gave me an injection". This is strange for me. Maybe the selection of "he" may not be arbitrary as it can even break the consistency constraint.

Doesn't look like it has context beyond one sentence, if that. I'm guessing something like GPT-3 would be much better at consistency in cases like these, but the bias would still remain, based on the training data.

Nowadays this would be where it would be appropriate to use a singular they. APA style guide recommends this. Not sure about other style guides.

For individual sentences in Turkish (which doesn't include gendered pronouns) it shows me two versions of the translation, one for the feminine and one for the masculine. If I add more sentences to the text, it only shows one version probably due to higher complexity of the task. The solution which comes to my mind is a kind of guided/interactive translation where I answer questions asked by Google Translate. These questions may be about genders, homonyms, homographs, etc.

Well what would a professional translator do? I imagine they might give you a side note that the source is actually ambiguous in context and the limitations of English do not allow a precise translation thus you should interpret the translation accordingly. Languages imply a lot of cultural context, and that should be communicated as necessary.

As someone who has done Japanese->English translation professionally, we almost never get a chance to leave notes like that for confirmation sadly. You go with what you're given 99% of the time. If gender cannot be determined, you use 'they'. I'm sure I could find this in our style guides somewhere.

Thank you! A ton of people here (and if we’re going to play statistical devil’s advocate like them, I’m assuming they’re men) don’t want to acknowledge the societal issue of this and think it’s okay. It’s not. Do I leave my first name off some technical CS publications specifically because people assume I’m male, and it usually is better received? With fewer condescending comments? Yes. And that’s what these types of assumptions touch on. But regardless of that, as someone who has spent years working in multi-lingual workplaces, this is just a poor translation and issue that should be fixed in that alone. You don’t randomly assign gender to things when it’s unclear. You ask/wait for more context  or you use “they”.

"Ő" doesn't imply gender that means the gender is unknown. A professional translator might use "they". It is a non-gendered English pronoun that had been used for centuries.  Or more awkwardly would use "He or she".  Of course "they" raise an other problem because in some simple sentences "they" would imply plurality.

What about using “it”? Or does that not really make sense in the Hungarian context?  
What about using “it”? Or does that not really make sense in the Hungarian context?  
No "it" translates to Hungarian "az" literarily "that". This would imply a non-living object or animal. Something that is not human. The only time I can think of you would use it for a human if you think of them as somewhat "sub-humans"  someone to look down to, or spite. Like "Az egy gazemeber" meaning "that is a criminal" You could use "Ő egy gazemeber" but using "Az" you can go one level lower.   A cleaning robot would be an "it".  or a turtle  or someone you have a very very low opinion.  PS I dont mean sub-human in a nazi way. Just someone you spite, have a very low opinion, someone you don't want to be associated with in any way.  
What about using “it”? Or does that not really make sense in the Hungarian context?  
“It” doesn’t make sense in an English translation referring to people. It should either use “he/she”, “(s)he” or “they” to denote ambiguity. That’s what we did with in-person translations as well going between French and English. Same with some suffixes in French where you (e) to indicate inclusivity of both genders. Or you have to ask for more context, which is an issue with things like this.

A professional translator would have nothing to do besides their work, because in real life most texts have context (You will know if the text is talking about Fatima or Tarik). These are toy examples created by the woke crowd to create stupid arguments or to justify their "jobs" as "ethics experts". I cannot wait for the Chinese to completely dominate this field so this nonsense is over

 Randomise according to estimated probability  Why? If the gender is unknown the correct translation is the ungendered "they", there's no reason to stochastically assume anything.

Idk, I could definitely see randomizing translations of the same sentence causing some other unforeseen problems

Most likely in what sense? ‘They’ is always factually correct, but less elegant. It’s not just a statistical question

I think this might be in part an artifact of the way the experiment was conducted. Translating "ő szép. ő okos." does yield "she is beautiful. he is clever.", but translating the two sentences separately yields alerts that both he and she are possibilities. I haven't tried the remainder, but expect them to be similar. So what I think might be happening is that it's not too hard to get the model to note that both "he" and "she" fits here, but Google Translate silently picks what the model deems the most likely version for texts with more than one sentence. If that is the case, I think giving the Google Translate UI team some time to develop a better UI would go a long way. :)

That's the ideal outcome for this, Google lets you click on the translation and it shows the possible alternatives, let the user deal with it.

The ideal outcome should be correctly identifying that the original pronouns are gender neutral, and therefore the translation should be, too. That just seems objectively the best option in this particular context-less case. How to actually go about doing that, and in particular whether there is a better way than manually encoding gender, is the hard question.

So the translation for "ő szép" (he/she is beautiful) would be "they're beautiful"? Or is there some English gender neutral pronoun that is unambiguously singular? edit: Now that I read my post, perhaps "he/she"? lol

Correct. The problem is it's ambiguous. It could be singular, it could be plural. Unfortunately we don't have an unambiguous word for it.

Yes, "they." No, I don't think there is an unambiguously singular alternative in English. Given the absence of context, greater ambiguity is better than guessing.

In Finnish (another language without gendered pronouns) this wouldn't work that well. As in Finnish the pronoun 'te' (they) can refer to an individual, but with way different meaning than the 3rd person 'hän' (he/she). Kinda like the 'royal we/they', but for normal people, also a roundabout way to say "sir/madam". I think the way should be to show both pronouns (he/she), or the whole thing twice for each one with a subtext that's something like "masculine/feminine, source ambiguous".  
So the translation for "ő szép" (he/she is beautiful) would be "they're beautiful"? Or is there some English gender neutral pronoun that is unambiguously singular? edit: Now that I read my post, perhaps "he/she"? lol  
For the translation of 'sibling' into Dutch (which doesn't have a translation for that word), Google Translate seems to default to "brother or sister". For example, it turns "my sibling is beautiful, my sibling is clever" into "my brother or sister is beautiful, my brother or sister is clever". So in line with that solution, "ő" would become "he or she".

That just seems objectively the best option in this particular context-less case.

This doesn’ make sense if you generalize. Example: English doesn’t gender objects by definite articles, but German, French, Spanish does. English just uses ‘the’ while Spanish uses ‘la’ and ‘el’. If you translate from English to Spanish the goal should NOT be to keep the English non-genderdness. My point: translations should follow actual language practice. So in the English-Hungarian case if ‘they’ reflects the language use it is an option, but always using it seems to eliminate the forms which in English is most common, i.e. using he or she.

You misunderstood me. I did not say that it should always use them. Only in "this particular context-less case." If it is clear from context what the gender of the person is, obviously it is fine to use a gendered pronoun.

I remember reading about learning gender-neutral word embeddings by optimizing an adjusted loss-function. They force some portion of the embedding to capture the "gender-ness" of a word, and the rest represents its meaning, etc. However, this was posted in the age before BERT/contextualized word embeddings, so not sure how useful this would be. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01496.pdf

For English, this would actually be interesting and pretty easy. I think you could swap out he/she his/her and so on during training and see what happens.  It's not a fix for all languages. Some - like German and French - have gender much deeper embedded and many words. But it would be interesting to see.  A part of me worries thought. From my perspective, gender is one among several current justice issues, and I'm sure you could provoke similar results using race. Some of these are much harder to fix, and knowing what to fix, when and how can get complex.  There is something nice about just solving the NLP problem. But then again, viewed as a bias in the data, it is part of the problem I'd usually be trying to solve.

Data augmentation? "When I asked her whether it had something to do with the other guy, she said no and I believe her." => "When I asked him whether it had something to do with the other girl, he said no and I believe him." Such transformations would be quite trivial.

Some randomisation where gender is not determined by context would partly solve the problem, and it would also indicate even to unsophisticated users that the translator doesn’t know what the gender is, or that the gender is unspecified.

Using they.  
Using they.  
It would lead to many ambiguities. Let's say that there's a sentence in Hungarian that could be translated to "They were talking about her/his plans". In your translation, it becomes, "They were talking about their plans". The "their" is ambiguous in the translation, even though it isn't in Hungarian. It's about tradeoffs, no solution is perfect (which doesn't mean the current solution is the best or that they're all equally defensible.)

 "They were talking about her/his plans"  If I understood the linked discussion correctly this would not happen, as her/his/they is the same word in hungarian, with no extra information. If an extra word was added to say "the man's plans" or "the woman's plans", then there would be information to transfer, but otherwise, the sentence you write simply would not exist to be translated in hungarian.

Hungarian distinguishes the singular from the plural, it just doesn’t distinguish gender. Right?

If there’s no gendered pronouns, then ‘they were talking about their plans,’ is correct. Also I presume sentences are structured to give context. If they’re not then yes, it’s not ideal but it’s the best trade off. You could use mx or Ze/Hir some kinda neopronoun would proudly how to approach it in English if you have to have it not be they/them.

It's not about "correctness", it's about effectively transmitting a message.  The current solution is biased because it adds extra information that is not present in the original message. Therefore, the message is not perfectly transmitted. Your solution is not biased in this sense, but at the cost of removing information in some cases (e.g. the Hungarian sentence makes a distinction that the translation doesn't). Therefore, the message is not perfectly transmitted.  If those are the only solutions, we have to make a value judgment about which problem is worse (as we agree).  
Has anybody discussed what would be the solution to this? Randomizing gender? Reversing the stereotype? Using some neutral pronoun? "Context" can't be an answer because, in cases such as these, there's no context  
The conundrum you're facing is that you're looking for a solution that treats political biases as data biases.  The solution is to stop equating political biases with data biases.  They're not the same, and cannot be solved the same way. Here's a thought experiment for context.  Let's say you have a hypothetical language where pronouns denote eye color, and another language where eye color is not part of pronouns.  Brown eyes are significantly more common than any other color other than in small pockets of strongly homogeneous cultures in specific countries.  This is an empirical fact.  When translating to/from the eye-color language, you're almost always going to get the brown eye pronouns... EXCEPT when you're talking about specific contexts that relate to cultural differences.  So without additional context, "O eats the food" is more likely to translate to "Brownie foodum eatum" over "Bluey foodum eatum", while "O eats the pickled herring" is far more likely to translate to "Bluey herringpicklum eatum" than a Brownie doing the same. If you come in here saying this is eyecolorist, the problem isn't data bias.  It's that you have a political bias that doesn't match objective reality.  Let's take something a little more real-world though... When I was a toddler and my dad was away, my mom dragged me to a quilt show.  When there, the women easily outnumber men 100:1 or more.  From a probabilistic model absent any other context, "she sews" is statistically orders of magnitude more likely than "he sews".  This is an empirically replicable and objective fact.  Acting like "O [sews]" is not very likely female... that's political bias, not data bias. Here's why it matters.  The way to solve data bias is to acquire MORE data that's MORE representative of reality.  It's why the face-morphing models that are trained on white faces will morph black faces to have white facial features.  We fix that data bias by including MORE data to better fit the training data to reality (namely, more people of all races). But political biases ALWAYS do the opposite.  This is because there's no amount of additionally representative data that makes "O [sews]" any less female.  Instead, political biases depend on censorship.  First they censor outputs, and when that doesn't work (because it never will), they try to censor inputs.  And that always fails in the long run too. At that point, that's not a problem in ML, and not a problem in the data.  It's a problem in your political biases.  The solution is that your political biases need to change.

The example in OP is obviously a problem, aside from the issues you're handwaving away as "political." The black box is supposed to translate text. But it has translated text and accreted empirical social phenomena to resolve ambiguity. That is a mistake, regardless of whether the pronoun the black box uses is actually the modal one in the population of text. Also, bud... Your post history... yeesh.

 From a probabilistic model absent any other context, "she sews" is statistically orders of magnitude more likely than "he sews".  A translation task isn't the same task as predicting what you'd see in the wild. It turns out that you can learn to translation by learning to predict what you'd see in the wild, but they're still different end goals that should be evaluated differently. Just because "he is clever" is more likely to be seen in the wild doesn't make it a better translation. Likewise with "she sews." You can't defend it by saying it's more likely because that's not the product they're trying to build.

what's the pasta source? anyway, here's my reply to another post: "I personally don't think it's a big deal, but if customers are complaining, it's a problem! Google already does a lot of work to reduce "algorithmic bias", I'm sure they will look at this too. Yes, biases are often good heuristics. But that's irrelevant, right? We're not asking Google "make an optimal prediction about the gender of the person who's being referred in this sentence", we're just asking it to translate something. If there is a way to translate without making assumptions, then it should do so. It would be awkward if Google started saying people were right handed when that's not included in the original (but assuming people are right handed is a good heuristic)."  
Has anybody discussed what would be the solution to this? Randomizing gender? Reversing the stereotype? Using some neutral pronoun? "Context" can't be an answer because, in cases such as these, there's no context  
I believe the correct pronoun is ”they” but people are not comfortable using it.

While Hungarian apparently uses context to differentiate O into he/she/it, it looks like for plural pronouns they have ők. In English we use context to differentiate “they” between singular and plural, so the translation using “they” would remain ambiguously gendered like the Hungarian but then would also be ambiguous about whether the text refers to one or many people.

The Hmong language is similar. The word "nws" is equivalent to "it" or "the/that person." Here's a translation from Hmong to English: https://i.imgur.com/M1gJuNO.png There's also some bias here as it relates to gender roles. I continued writing more things and not only do I notice some gender role bias but also a heavier bias towards using male pronouns. 🤷

Gender Bias in ML is definitely a rising, serious issue, and it is something that is being actively researched by lots of people, including the Google themselves. This looks like the decoder for English has gender bias in terms of actions/roles. But the comments saying "just modify few codes so the pronouns are always they/them" like it is a rule based model makes me cringe. Large amounts of people there seem to not know anything about Neural Networks and Machine Translation in general. I mean... I wish people at least watch some YouTube videos about the topic instead of shaming ML engineers for "being too stupid to change few lines of code".

 Gender Bias in ML is definitely a rising, serious issue  I mean, you could really say it's an issue that's always been here, since ML inherits its gender bias from society. So, if anything, the baseline is for ML to be as biased as society, though we should strive to make ML a force for reducing bias if we can.

I don't know what offense you're taking here, you can't expect everyone to "watch some YouTube videos" about ML. It isn't uncommon to do rule-based preprocessing or post processing either. I don't think anyone is shaming ML engineers in that comments section.

I admit I'm fairly new to ML, and could be considered as one who knows nothing, but what if we simy change the training data? I'm thinking along the lines of some regex magic to change he and she to he/she, and then surely the net would not learn any bias? At the cost of being utterly nongenderspecific of course.... Or just go wild and expose it to both he and she cases and see what pops out?

That would be data augmentation, which is a viable solution to this given enough time and resources to do so.

"Should" and "ought" are decided politically, not by dataset and model selection. Edit: Well, the downvotes are clear but anyone wants to write an argued response? Should the researcher push his/her own values instead of deferring to a larger context, allowing the involved parties to politically agree on what is acceptable? Seems to be a no-win situation where you have to pick sides.

What's unbiased in a training sample can be biased in an inference context. (e.g. if you train your system on medical journals only, you may find that it keeps on using technical terms instead of lay terms) What's more is that there may not exist a corpus for you to train on that would be universally unbiased during inference (e.g. the sum total of the English language literature may very well have a bias to use "he" more often when talking about intelligence - this "frequentist result" has no explanatory power whatsoever). This is The Problemtm.  
Isn't bias supposed to be an unjustified predisposition towards a certain answer?  
I don't know if you're making a joke and I'm whooshing, but even if you are, not everyone might get it. The gender preference may be statistically justified, but it is not justified as a societal norm. Societal norms (at least in mainstream media and politics) prescribe gender equality, and any linguistic preference for one over the other would be considered a normative bias.  The reason why it is important to discuss this is that real, existing inequalities that we are trying to fight politically are perpetuated by these normatively biased (but statistically representative) models.  Gender preference for household chores are still a mild example for the shitshow that is waiting to happen if this is left undebated.

Gender preference for household chores are still a mild example for the shitshow that is waiting to happen if this is left undebated.  
And the degree of "statistical justification" really depends on the example, too. There's an argument to be had between "assuming by default that a nurse is a woman is a bad social norm" and "yes, but by the statistics it is a reasonably accurate guess". I very much stand by the former, but the "statistical argument" for the inference is easy to understand, and we can debate its merits. Associating "he" with "reads", "clever", and "plays music" isn't some obvious statistical inference to draw, whatsoever. Like, I don't doubt that this occurs in the training data, but that's very different from it reflecting some statistical analysis we can understand and argue about. Not that it really matters, but the studies I've seen typically show women reading a fair bit more books than men. In the way we talk about "reading", that probably leads to some weird bias in the training data which associates it with men. But it's simply untrue that this quirk of the training accurately reflects some broader statistical truth about society.  There's no obvious reason that I can think of why one should associate reading with men, even ignoring the arguments that such assumptions are bad societal norms. In the case of female nurses, I can disagree with the practice itself, but the actual statistical argument is obvious. So it's an added layer of bad bias here–it's not even accurately reflecting our understanding of society, just our biased description of it!  
Isn't bias supposed to be an unjustified predisposition towards a certain answer?  
Nope. Bias is relative to whatever you're trying to estimate (an estimand). In causal inference this is a huge issue. You build an estimator that under one data gathering process gives an unbiased estimated of the average treatment effect of X on Y, but under another data gathering process gives an unbiased estimate of 'the average effect of X on Y plus the correlation between X and Z times the average effect of Z on Y.' (What generally happens when you don't randomize on X or don't don't measure Z). It's unbiased in both cases, but they're unbiased estimators of different things. If your goal is to estimate the average treatment effect of X on Y, then the latter estimator is biased. The estimator is unbiased on one estimand while the same estimator is biased on another estimand. The point being bias is a function of the estimator, the data gathering process, and the thing you're trying to estimate. In the ML context, 'the thing you're trying to estimate' is 'the task you're trying to automate.' An ML model can be unbiased on one task while the same model is biased on another task. So the question is what are we trying to build a model to automate? Predict pronouns used in sentences in the wild or translate language according to some style guide? If it's the former, it's unbiased. If it's the latter, it's biased (assuming a typical style guide).

A bias is when your model doesn't reflect the label distribution of the "population", in this case the corpus. Are you saying a full frequency analysis of these phrases on the whole corpus wouldn't turn out with the same probability argmax on "she" vs "he"?

The corpus population doesn't necessarily match a real life population, since it wasn't gathered with that goal in mind. And training doesn't necessarily match the corpus exactly here since this is not the purpose of the model.

That's statistical bias, yes. The point is that the distribution of data reinforces bias qua prejudice due to it being generated in a biased society. But surely that's obvious so why harp on this irrelevant point your are making

except you have to be specific on the type of bias.  this is not data bias.  this is political bias. data biases come from data not matching reality, and is fixed with adding more data that's more representative of reality.  political biases come from politics not matching reality, and is fixed by removing politics. easy example... there are plenty of activities men and women prefer over the other gender.  go over to bike week and men outnumber women 1000:1.  now go over to a quilt show and women outnumber men 1000:1.  saying "he rides his motorcycle" and "she sews her quilt" when translating from a genderless language are statistically much more likely to be accurate than not. there is no amount of additional data that would change those outcomes.  political biases would awkwardly force gender neutrality in a language where gender neutrality is not observed, or even worse... just censor it outright.  
It seems like it’s just used examples of what it has seen the most in the training data.  
That’s bias  
That’s bias  
Bias in the real world though. Do you think the translation should not represent the real world?  If so, what is preferred - should all gendered things be randomised at 50:50? That would compensate for the bias in the data, but it would be less representative of reality. It’s unclear to me which is more beneficial to someone trying to learn the language.  Perhaps they just provide two translations of everything? Might be more confusing in some situations though.

I mean, that's kind of what I want it to give me. The statistical best guess.  
I mean, that's kind of what I want it to give me. The statistical best guess.  
Really? So if there are 50.1% women and 49.9% men, we should always assume a woman?  
I mean, that's kind of what I want it to give me. The statistical best guess.  
Except English does have gender neutral pronouns. There's no need to guess when there is a 100% correct translation possible.  
It gets more fun: Put "Παίζει μουσική" (plays music). Male.  Put "Μεγαλώνει δύο παιδάκια" (raising two children). Female.  ;) It's got some bias in there too don't worry.  Or more exotic: Του έριξε μπουνιά (punched him) but τον χαστούκισε (slapped him). See the difference? According to GTranslate men punch but women slap 😂  
Hey, same result in Turkish :). Men punch, woman slap :)  
[D] An example of machine learning bias on popular. Is this specific case a problem? Thoughts?
I'm frustrated at all the comments whenever this comes up about "it just represents society." I think we as a community are too quick to recognize what's under the hood. For example, if you bought a dictionary and it defined "nurse" as "a woman trained to care for the sick or infirm, especially in a hospital." you'd say that's weird and unnecessarily gendered and a product failure. But when someone tries to use ML to build a dictionary, a bunch of our community defends it because it reflects society. The goal of writing a dictionary is the same, but we hold them to different bars depending on whether they're made manually versus automated. Why? I think we hold them to different bars because we know what's under the hood and how they're trained and what they're trained on. We see that it does well at this predictive task and defend it instead of saying 'it's good, but at the wrong task.' In the example above, if you used a human translator, you'd say this translation has issues. Google translate seems to be doing great at a translation task, but failing at aspects of the translation task we want it to be good at. They're different tasks. The model versus the product. As practitioners, we need to start being wary of when being unbiased at the training task isn't the same as being unbiased at the end task we're actually trying to automate.

i mean it's the simple argument of if your data is biased, your model will be biased, and you need to intervene to make sure your model, trained on biased data, is as neutral as possible.  
[D] An example of machine learning bias on popular. Is this specific case a problem? Thoughts?
Well it is a problem, but not because the computer is making an assumption but because it's not making the same assumption everywhere, which means that the model doesn't use enough context on what it is actually doing and gives too much weight on what it learned. It's hard to remove these biases because humans could have the same biases, and algorithms aren't necessary superior to what they copy. Though the algorithm isn't supposed to leak biases this way. After the first guess, the algorithm should stick with that guess. But of course engineers working on these models don't understand every languages they translate, they can't fix all issues for all languages, and if the training set doesn't give to the algorithm the information that it is supposed to keep the first guess for the whole translation, it's hard to engineer/hardcode a model that'll be able to guarantee this behavior. And of course all of that is even worse if there are explicit biases that forbid the model from knowing it has to do one unique guess. It would be the case here if all these sentences were simultaneously written and translated exactly like that somewhere (It's probably not the case) And you can also use some NLP datasets with genders to process these biases but it's hard to have engineers and datasets to do that for all languages.  
Well it is a problem, but not because the computer is making an assumption but because it's not making the same assumption everywhere, which means that the model doesn't use enough context on what it is actually doing and gives too much weight on what it learned. It's hard to remove these biases because humans could have the same biases, and algorithms aren't necessary superior to what they copy. Though the algorithm isn't supposed to leak biases this way.

I’m not sure if the consistency of the guess is the problem. NLP allows for that variety, esp in long paragraphs. When this presents as a consistency in the dataset, the model is bound to overlearn. Concur with everything else.

If I had to translate that, at least I would stay consistent with my first choice. So I'm saying it's the problem just because I think a NLP model can learn that and because that's what I would do. The model can have this variety but I guess it should have learned that it's not supposed to use that variety in a context with a lot of similar sentences. But that's also an opinion on how to translate things. Usually if you make one guess, you'll want to stick to that guess for coherence. I think models can learn to do that with a good dataset. Maybe some people would have translated that by making a guess for each sentence, and maybe it makes more sense to do that for this language in which case I would be wrong.

While your point is correct I dont think it applies in this situation. The text in question resets the context each sentence but using the "O" to start the sentence. There is not way to tell that the sentence is about the same subject. I actually applaud the algo for NOT making the assumption about continued context. An interesting test would be to use a non gendered name in the first sentence and infer it as the subject in the latter sentences instead of a language specific non gendered identifier and see if this same "bias" applies. I suspect it won't.

This is driven by the English side of the training data and the lack of an option for "He / She".  If you you were to translate The Hungarian phrase "[pronoun] is a father", 99.9999% of the training data.  And the assumption would be correct in almost all cases.  As you move towards the middle it is less clear and biased by historical data.  Take for example, "[pronoun] is a college student".  The corpus would skew heavily male until the 1970s and then gradually shift every year until in the past decade it would be the opposite.

Hungarian here. To me this seems, that these examples on the image are engineered quite selectively in a way to trigger certain blanket conclusions (ie. google translate is sexist). Most often if I change the adjective to a synonym it changes gender: Ő okos --> He is clever. Ő brilliáns. --> She is brilliant. So I would like to see a more comprehensive analysis than this image before speaking of any "problem" or "bias".

So I guess I'm just going to go out on a limb and say that yes, this is a problem and it needs to be solved. While harmless in this case, doing little more than offend people who don't understand whats going on or don't care, the fact that the AI we're dropping into the world has this kind of unexpected behavior, much of which is far more subtle than what we see here, is a serious issue that is going to need to be solved. Sometimes AI researchers will talk about theoretical stamp-collecting strong AI that collects stamps at the expense of normal human values like "don't enslave the entire human race and force them spend all their time producing stamps." These were theoretical problems, but we have here a real-world example of that. These algorithms are optimizing for the data and the goals we gave them and they don't understand and aren't programmed to understand human moral and social values. As a result, we are releasing ML into the wild which violates society's values and we don't have any way to stop or prevent this from happening, yet the problem are only going to get worse and the consequences more severe. So yes, we need to figure this out. We don't have a solution and right now its still silly, inconsequential problems, but this does represent a very serious unsolved issue.

To everyone saying 'It't not a bias if it's statistically represented like this in the data.' : What do you think 'the data' comes from? Does it magically fall from the sky or something like that? Have you maybe ever given a thought about the circumstance that after keeping women in inferior positions for some couple of hundred (thousand) years and only reversing this process ever so slightly in the very recent times, maybe, just maybe the text fragments that are accumulated in a very specific medium *could* reflect this history?

If these languages don't have built-in bias, how does this impact on their actual cultures? Does a "naturally gendered" language help with preventing disparities between sexes?  
[D] An example of machine learning bias on popular. Is this specific case a problem? Thoughts?
I do not speek much hungarian, but for some of the examples there exist male and female forms (or even words): "ö jóképű" translates to "he is beautiful". Szép is usually used in a female context. For a female professor you would probably say "professzor nö" (though I'm not 100% sure about that one). Doesn't apply to all of them of course.

This happens a lot when you translate from Spanish. Spanish has gendered subject and direct object pronouns but possessive and indirect object pronouns are gender neutral.

How would anyone translate that passage. You would need to ultimately substitute a gender in there, either way you go you applying a bias. You cant provide something imperfect information and expect a result that fits your world belief. Not one can fabricate accurate data in an absence of any meaningful context. For instance if I give you the word "Cat" and tell you make a sentence from it, you come back with something about the milk or cuddles or internet pics. I then get all triggered cause I was talking about a Lion and your feline prejudice is why society is collapsing and is responsible for every injustice that ever existed. I am not saying that AI bias does not exist, but it is a function of the specific design. We do not have  generalised AI yet, and most applications are built fit for purpose. Cleary this product was not designed to magically infer context. And I assure you, gender bias is the least of Google Translates issues.

Not saying bias is not a problem, it is, but to point out, there is a difference between saying that one person typically does something (ie in the literature) and saying that someone should do something (because of a perceived societal role).  The moment someone says "See, this is evidence that women are suited to these tasks, and therefore, it is right to have this expectation" then that is the problem. It's not the data itself it's the justification for discrimination.

This example is cherry picked, how many like it can we find? I mean, you rarely see the translation "he is a construction worker" raise PC critique. It's a short list of un/desirable jobs and adjectives that cause the stir. And before judging if this is right or wrong, let's remember that both social bias exists and people who like traditional roles. We should strive to improve society but also respect people's personal choices even when they don't go in the same direction as we would like. We can't simply fix this at the translation level.

This is just a mildly irritating and sad nothingburger.  There are many ethical concerns to do with ML and "bias" is the least of them, but somehow it gets all the attention. For example, as far as I know Google is secretly working with the government on providing AI solutions to the military, even though they publicly announced that they'll stop. So let's be real: this is only trending because these sort of topics are popular within culture wars. It's cheap outrage over something that's ultimately inconsequential. This is the result I see when I type just one of these expressions in. Not so bad, isn't it? Now it's a UI problem - how to inform the user gender ambiguity with longer text inputs without cluttering the UI. Google clearly opted for disabling the feature informing about ambiguity in favour of letting the model do its thing. And last but not least, the text used in this meme is itself pretty biased, considering that you can also get these results: ő gyilkos = he is a killer ő erőszaktevő = he is a rapist ő tolvaj = he is a thief I don't think I need to name the bias in the meme.

Your first argument is nonsense. It's fine to be concerned about multiple aspects at once.

Bias in AI can be a real problem, but it appears to me that most people researching it are wasting time asking/answering the wrong question. The real question isn't whether an AI algorithm is biased (to which the answer is, unsurprisingly, almost always yes); it's whether the AI algorithm is more or less biased than a human doing the same job. Because if the algorithm is less biased than humans, then problem solved - we should be rushing to jump on the algorithm as quickly as possible. But I haven't seen any research that actually does that. They just point out that an algorithm is biased and call it a day. That's because leaving your computer and interacting with other people to set up a human study as a control is tough work. Much easier to write a short python script that gives you a number with no baseline to compare to and let the media whip themselves in a frenzy and link to your arXiv preprint because bias > 0 and p < 0.05.

 But I haven't seen any research that actually does that.  Most research that does this is published in CHI or other UX-related conferences where researchers work to understand how algorithmic process compare to human processes. Also, you can find research like this in domain-specific journals (i.e. criminal justice journals where researchers want to understand how judges uses algorithmic risk assessment score in their sentencing decisions). If you're looking only at publications in NeurIPS or ICML-type venues, you're not going to come across these papers because most ML researchers are trained on how to conduct the semi-structured interviews needed to complete this kind of research.

Sure, because we all have an infinite pool of attention and emotional capability to care. In fact human empathy infallibly extends to billions of others humans, no matter where on the planet do they live. Right? Wrong. If we are even a bit serious about tackling a set of problems the first thing we do with them is prioritize, and then assign available resources accordingly. However, if all we want to do is give people the impression that we're virtuous and caring then we won't even bother doing that.

The sad part is humans are not rational beings. We also tend to pick advocacies that are easier to digest and participate (in the end it's all just a marketing strategy). Given the current situation, people have been emotionally drained for the past year. We can expect people to be more apathetic with all the empathy fatigue especially when it seems like it's a few degrees away from directly affecting them. Btw, I have nothing against your message. In fact, I 100% agree that the discussion should revolve on stronger issues like Project Maven. I might be a bit cynical, but I think not unless, it evolves into an issue where people can directly associate the harm, that's the only time people will start caring.

 I think not unless, it evolves into an issue where people can directly associate the harm, that's the only time people will start caring.  I agree, it's futile to simply bet on some form of spontaneous mix of higher awareness and good-will. It's a systemic issue, as at the very least these problems should be placed in front of people instead of them having to go digging online to learn about them. Also, most people just have too many problems to worry about in their own lives to care about the bigger picture, leaving the public discussion up for domination by people who care for rather unhealthy reasons. Spending 15 minutes on Twitter is enough to see what I mean.

You think that bias is less of a problem than military AI but that's just your opinion. I personally think that military AI is like drone vs manned aircraft. It's cheaper, safer and comfortable for the pilot but there is no difference for the guy getting bombed. I doubt the are building skynet and it's probably some image processing or other boring task.

 There are many ethical concerns to do with ML and "bias" is the least of them  How is bias so unimportant? I would think this would be one of the largest issues. I saw one video where a company was pricing health insurance from if someone was born a certain day of the week. It's easy for a model to easily pick up very bad biases. (or even illegal discrimination)  If you're working on a problem that will determine the quality of life of another person, then you should be worried with eliminating biases. edit: Here was the video

There are simply many more important concerns regarding AI. Automating warfare is one; autonomous killer machines will not blow the whistle on war crimes and it will become impossible to counter warmongering politicians with concerns about soldiers' lives. Automating jobs without any consideration for the labourers is another, double emphasis on the part in italics. Automating labour can lead to great things, but in the end AI is just a tool and it can also lead to disastrous outcomes if used irresponsibly. The currently dominating school of economic thought does not at all dictate concern for people dispossessed of their source of income, quite the opposite. AI being applied to the data illegally harvested by rogue intelligence agencies is yet another concern that is more important than bias. Edward Snowden's leaks revealed deep corruption and unaccountability within the intelligence community, and the system has not changed for the better. AI being applied for narrative control in operations similar to those of Cambridge Analytica is yet another. You talk of AI pricing health insurance, but in this case health insurance companies could use AI to make sure that Medicare For All never happens. Bias is just something that Western culture is currently obsessed about. Sure, it's a problem in AI, but as with everything it needs to be viewed in context. In fact I'd say we are overly biased towards bias and that it's time to correct our neural networks.

This isn't really much of an ethical concern for engineers and researchers. Awareness is raised all the time for this problem, but holding back automation is a dumb solution. (I even saw in one state, a union was trying to get legislation passed that would limit the amount of self checkouts because it was eliminating workers. Why not just petition an automation tax for their workers? Why the seriously counterproductive policies instead?)   AI being applied to the data illegally harvested by rogue intelligence agencies is yet another concern that is more important than bias. Edward Snowden's leaks revealed deep corruption and unaccountability within the intelligence community, and the system has not changed for the better.  The majority of people practicing in machine learning are not working on datasets collected by secret agencies. This is pretty insignificant to what actual machine learning engineers and researchers should be concerned with beyond raising awareness to the issue and trying to get legislation passed to combat this. This is much like the war example used.  AI being applied for narrative control in operations similar to those of Cambridge Analytica is yet another. You talk of AI pricing health insurance, but in this case health insurance companies could use AI to make sure that Medicare For All never happens.  Again, this is a serious issue, though, most engineers are researchers are dealing with bias much more frequently than some conspiracy to influence elections.  Bias is just something that Western culture is currently obsessed about. Sure, it's a problem in AI, but as with everything it needs to be viewed in context. In fact I'd say we are overly biased towards bias and that it's time to correct our neural networks.  No, it's one of the most common issues in machine learning that people often ignore which results in lawsuits that can lose companies millions of dollars. (and cause all kinds of harm) There's a lot of people that do not care about the harm that they may cause. (so I still don't see how bias in unimportant)  
 Automating warfare is one; autonomous killer machines will not blow the whistle on war crimes and it will become impossible to counter warmongering politicians with concerns about soldiers' lives.  I think everyone is very aware of the issues with automating warfare. This has been a leading reason Google has resisted working with the government. (and even when they were, I think it was mostly in relation to defense)   Automating jobs without any consideration for the labourers is another, double emphasis on the part in italics. Automating labour can lead to great things, but in the end AI is just a tool and it can also lead to disastrous outcomes if used irresponsibly. The currently dominating school of economic thought does not at all dictate concern for people dispossessed of their source of income, quite the opposite.  This isn't really much of an ethical concern for engineers and researchers. Awareness is raised all the time for this problem, but holding back automation is a dumb solution. (I even saw in one state, a union was trying to get legislation passed that would limit the amount of self checkouts because it was eliminating workers. Why not just petition an automation tax for their workers? Why the seriously counterproductive policies instead?)   AI being applied to the data illegally harvested by rogue intelligence agencies is yet another concern that is more important than bias. Edward Snowden's leaks revealed deep corruption and unaccountability within the intelligence community, and the system has not changed for the better.  The majority of people practicing in machine learning are not working on datasets collected by secret agencies.

 I think everyone is very aware of the issues with automating warfare.  Is/ought. You're naively optimistic.  This isn't really much of an ethical concern for engineers and researchers.   If, say, Iran was found to be developing a nuclear weapon using enriched uranium from their power plants, would it be an ethical concern for the engineers operating these plants? AI is a tool, and researchers/engineers have a choice in who and under what conditions do they sell their labour to. Besides, this is a concern for everyone. It's a potential systemic problem.  The majority of people practicing in machine learning are not working on datasets collected by secret agencies.   The majority of people circulating this "bias" meme online aren't working in AI at all. I'm also pretty sure most people commenting here are also not even working with NLP.   Again, this is a serious issue, though, most engineers are researchers are dealing with bias much more frequently than some conspiracy to influence elections.   Do you seriously think people's responsibilities and cares are bound within their professional environments? Let me ask you this: do you consume media? Do you have political opinions? Do you vote? Well then.  [bias] results in lawsuits that can lose companies millions of dollars   Further proof that this is a less important issue. Companies losing millions of dollars should not be a public concern. Sorry, but I believe that there is such a thing as society. Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but your arguments present you as a person who thinks everyone should only care about their own work and their corporations' profits. I'm not willing to engage with that any more than I already have.  
This is just a mildly irritating and sad nothingburger.  There are many ethical concerns to do with ML and "bias" is the least of them, but somehow it gets all the attention. For example, as far as I know Google is secretly working with the government on providing AI solutions to the military, even though they publicly announced that they'll stop. So let's be real: this is only trending because these sort of topics are popular within culture wars. It's cheap outrage over something that's ultimately inconsequential. This is the result I see when I type just one of these expressions in. Not so bad, isn't it? Now it's a UI problem - how to inform the user gender ambiguity with longer text inputs without cluttering the UI. Google clearly opted for disabling the feature informing about ambiguity in favour of letting the model do its thing. And last but not least, the text used in this meme is itself pretty biased, considering that you can also get these results: ő gyilkos = he is a killer ő erőszaktevő = he is a rapist ő tolvaj = he is a thief I don't think I need to name the bias in the meme.   
3 is just as much a problem.

"He or she" or "they" are valid options to use here. "Ő" doesn't imply gender in any way. It is either known from the context or unimportant for the topic in hand. It is actually kind of rude to assume gender from "Ő". That said there are some errors or quirks  in the translation. In Hungarian the profession suffix often (but not always) implies gender. And if you know the gender it is weird not to use it. So assuming gender is known from the context. "Ő egy takarító" actually explicitly says "He is a cleaner"  (It wouldn't technically be wrong to assume either gender but for that profession 99% time without specifying female this would be a he. ) "Ő egy takarítónő" explicitly says "she is a cleaner" literarily "He or she is a cleaner woman." BUT "Ő egy asszisztens" could be "He or she" and "Ő egy asszisztens nő" explicitly define a female assistant.  In this profession. "asszisztens" often refers both male or female. But you can specify female.

It actually is a problem, not only from the ethical stand point (encoding biases), but also from the model alignment perspective (making your generative/transformative models do what you actually want them to). This specific case is due to how the translation language models are trained at Google - specifically, parallel language corpora with generation of training examples through partial occlusion.  As such, to achieve the best score, the model has to pick a gender (because singular they pronouns are still rare in English text corpora) and will learn statistical associations between the gender and the context. For instance if "he is a doctor" is encountered more frequently than "she is a doctor" in English corpora for parallel translation, the model will learn that and without any clue from the source language (eg. pronouns from gender-agnosticl languages) will automatically pick the most frequently encountered pronoun in the context. The gender bias is just one of the many problems that models trained this way present. The numerous Google autocomplete fails come from the same learned statistical association (+ sprinkled on top is the browsing history/location/... context Google has inferred or knows about you). The problem with the models is more general - they are basically shallow statistical engines. Or as Timnit Gebru put it in the paper that got her and Margaret Mitchell fired from Google "Stochastic Parrots". And just as with real parrots, you need to be very careful what and how you teach them lest you them to learn to swear and cite your racist uncle.

Racial bias is also a big problem. Facial recognition software scores poorly when asked to identify the face of black and brown people. The police using these models as a source of evidence has already resulted in court rulings about ai's role in criminal justice. We tend to look at AI subconsciously with a presumption of infallibility, at least, people not directly involved in the creation of these models, that leads police to making quick judgements based on models that can be incorrect 35% of the time.

It might be, but I find this pretty odd. Women read more than men (at least in the western world), so if it's a statistical thing, you would guess that it would translate to she for the reads. Also I think the sentiment "clever girl" is a little more common in pop culture than "clever boy". In both cases this is borne out through google searches of the phrases. The feminine has more results (he/she reads -- he/she is clever). So it's a little odd for it to be bias as the bias should go the other way. Maybe its just random chance, how many such phases/languages did you try before you found this example? It might also have something to do with the Polish translation dataset.

Honestly, I don't think so. The model is getting the biases correct, right? There's a lot of guessing and inferring in language. If you have a prompt with "Ugh this phone is so expensive! It's $...." Then you would want the model fill in it's bias for what it thinks as expensive phone is, I would say like $1000. I'm sure a lot of people would agree with that. If you search on Google "Cheap phone" you don't want it to recommend you $1,000 phones, you would want it to filter out for maybe the $200 - $600 range. Likewise if you explicitly searched for "Woman's jobs", if you're searching for that you're probably expecting to find assistant, teacher, nurse. Although if you do search for that, what comes up for me is "High-Paying Careers for Women: CEO, Pharmacist, Nurse, Computer and information manager, lawyer, ..." that's pretty cool. Also you need the model to be able to assume that if there's a person giving birth, it's probably a woman. If it's someone taking the deadlift world record, it's probably a man. If the person has a dick, it's probably a man. This is just how language works. Don't blame the AI for picking up biases most people would agree exists.

My guess is it's just an n-gram frequency issue, not some deep seated case of discrimination.  
Most n-gram frequency "issues" occur because the issue is present in the language that people actually use. In this case, it's relatively well-known that our society has some set of expectations when it comes to assuming a gender for a job; those expectations are clearly reflected in the co-occurrence probabilities. Whether or not the expectations have a causal relationship with the discrimination in our society is not the point of my comment, (although it seems to be the general consensus that it is so), but that the two cannot be easily separated as your comment may suggest.

You're talking PC nonsense.  N-gram frequency issue has nothing to do with societal expectations. It simply reflects the fact that some genders are more likely to do different things. Funny how we never hear PC nuts complaining how "he is a garbageman" is sexist. Or how such model would assume that males are thieves and rapists. It only applies when he is <something desirable>. All in all this is not a an issue at all, it's just another opportunity for low IQ PC acolytes to insert themselves into a discussion they know nothing about to signal their superior virtues.

The only statement that naturally follows from the statement that 'a specific gendered word is more likely to be used within a certain distance away from a specific occupation,' (which, if I'm not mistaken, is the definition of n-gram frequency) is that 'the users of the language more often than not use that gendered word with that specific occupation.' Your assertion that  n-gram frequency issue simply reflects the fact that some genders are more likely to do different things  digresses from the aforementioned point, which does not assume anything about the relationship between the language people use and the actual gender distribution for each occupation. ​ Regarding this issue, I mentioned that "it's relatively well-known that our society has some set of expectations when it comes to assuming a gender for a job", because language does not accurately reflect real world data. The discrepancies could come from incorrect real-world observations based on personal biases, gendered words used in gender-neutral contexts for lack of a better word, social expectations reflected in fiction, etc. etc. As stated above, this has nothing to do with whether or not these expectations have a causal relationship with discrimination, nor the lack or existence of political correctness which you seem to abhor.

That’s a pretty silly statement. The onus is on you to prove that there is discrepancy between gendered language and actual gender distribution of people doing things. I don’t need to assume that there are invisible gnomes pushing things around when talking about gravity. It is you who needs to prove that there are invisible gnomes at play before you’re allowed to make appeals to their effect. Anybody who understands basics of the scientific method knows that.

You could interpret it in a sexist way ("why is she doing all the housework and he is doing all the money-work?"), but, to be fair, you often need to make assumptions during translations and the assumptions made here are the same I would have made. Simply, "She is beautiful" comes up much more often than "He is beautiful", and thus the translator assumed the gender. ​ One solution might be simply adding a note explaining that the gender is unknown and the used gender is just a guess. IMHO, this would be clean and effective, and probably the best option overall. ​ Another solution, although pretty similar to the previous one, would be to default to a gender (instead of making possibly sexist guesses) and explaining that the gender is unknown from that context alone. However, this requires making a choice of which gender to default to, which is going to be WAY more sexist (assuming supremacy of one gender over the other language-wisely) than just guessing each time and explaining that that guess is just the result of statistics and does not represent Google's opinion. ​ Despite being a fan of the word, you can't use "they" because that would be much more often misunderstood as a plural, rather than an unknown gender pronoun. At the moment, there are no grammatically-correct ways to address a person of unknown gender without also introducing either ambiguity (singular-plural ambiguity with "they") or awkward sentences ("the subject is beautiful"). ​ I wouldn't be against the introduction of a dedicated pronoun for unknown gender (accompanied by a note that explains it), but I can see why the team decided not to: they don't want to introduce new grammar into English (and other languages), because I'm pretty positive that anything Google does on their mainstream products has the potential to have a huge impact on society. If they started to spell wednesday as wensday, in matter of years the latter would become accepted by most while not becoming official for a longer period of time (I'm no expert, but in Italian it took YEARS to accept "lui/lei" instead of "egli/ella" in grammar books despite the former being used 99.99% of the time, even in formal speech). This COULD be a working solution if they used something that is CLEARLY not a real word but just a keyword, like "[SUBJECT]". Other words in the sentence would still need to assume gender if needed (which happens a lot in many non-English languages). ​ The last option would be a "he/she", but that would force other words in the sentence to include both options, which may or may not change the sentence drastically. For example, in Italian you'd have something along the lines of "lui/lei è un/una professore/professoressa", and THAT would be too clumsy for a professional product.

After all my work on pronoun resolution I figured I'd run this by my program, but it picked "language" as the referent of "it", regarding "processing" as a relative clause indicating what natural language is doing. Is there a linguistic reason to assume such constructs are compound words if the computer has never heard of it, or is that just a matter of rote learning? (CoreNLP does consider it a compound word)   On a related note: The second Winograd Schema Challenge was held a few weeks ago, so we may see some progress on pronoun disambiguation when the results are published.

I tried plugging it into spacy to see if a simple dependency/named entity solution would work, and the closest I could get (without programming in logic) was Language Processing. So I think that we'd probably need to train a model to pick up the last object and to recognize the whole 'what do we want/when do we want it' idiom.

 Is there a linguistic reason to assume such constructs are compound words if the computer has never heard of it  I just stumbled onto this sub randomly, and I have zero expertise in any computational field, but I do know that the original text is mildly ungrammatical: a hyphen is needed between "natural" and "language."

This is a rule that seems to be seldom taught, and so I notice that hyphen omissions are ubiquitous in all forms of writing — though especially STEM writing, for some reason — but, to my knowledge, all major style guides still explicitly require a hyphen between the components of a compound modifier. If a hyphen were present, would your program still get the meaning wrong?

You make a good point, it should have a hyphen. The general problem with the hyphen rule is that it is too loosely defined, leaving it up to the writer to decide in which context something is "confusing" enough to warrant a hyphen. Because it is so inconsistently applied and because speech recognition doesn't add hyphens either, I made my program blind to them. However, I should reconsider that because hyphens are solid clues when they are present. Thank you for your input :)

But language is organic, and especially with the explosion of jargon this century nobody anywhere is using hyphens for compound words and terms. It's either just two words, or remove the space, or portmanteau. That being the case, it's the style guides that are actually out of date and NLP needs to be prepared to leapfrog ahead of that.

Input will come from laypeople, not from scholars or pedants so we have to know our audience. :o  
Good points. However, if the major publishers still use punctuation in a certain way, then NLP should at least be capable of parsing writing with that style of punctuation. A program could use context to disambiguate hyphenless compounds and make use of the hyphen rule for hyphenated ones, right? If OP's parser failed to give the correct interpretation with the hyphen present, that would seem to be an easily avoidable problem.

Fair enough, this approach sounds about ideal. I didn't perceive that you were offering a debugging step instead of simply opining that the text as-is was somehow malformed and thus irrelevant to get confused, per "This is a rule that seems to be seldom taught". :J  
 Is there a linguistic reason to assume such constructs are compound words if the computer has never heard of it  I just stumbled onto this sub randomly, and I have zero expertise in any computational field, but I do know that the original text is mildly ungrammatical: a hyphen is needed between "natural" and "language." (NLP is the processing of natural language, not a particularly natural kind of language processing.) This is a rule that seems to be seldom taught, and so I notice that hyphen omissions are ubiquitous in all forms of writing — though especially STEM writing, for some reason — but, to my knowledge, all major style guides still explicitly require a hyphen between the components of a compound modifier. If a hyphen were present, would your program still get the meaning wrong?  
Hyphens are ugly, though: who wants to type e-mail and on-line?  
Hyphens are ugly, though: who wants to type e-mail and on-line?  
Yeah, we're not accustomed to seeing so many hyphens anymore, which is why "The Amazing Spider-Man" raised eyebrows. But in one particular circumstance, hyphens are a very useful and time-tested way of making English clearer: in compound modifiers preceding nouns (such as "time-tested" in this sentence). This is one rule I will be a prescriptivist about, because it's clear-cut, easy to apply, and not too cumbersome. I am prepared to die on this hill :)

Is it still on huggingface? I can't find it.  
That's a very good question and probably hard to answer without further experiments and highly depends on the task. GPT-3 certainly is much better than our approach at generating long sequences of text (e.g., summarization or machine translation).  
What is the limit for sequence generation for your model?

Hi there, sorry for the late reply, I haven't been checking out reddit for a while. We have not yet investigated whether (or how) PET works for token-level classification tasks like NER (as opposed to sequence-level classification), but I think this is a very interesting area for future work!

Thanks for the very interesting paper and for being willing to answer qn on Reddit! I have a qn abt Section 3.1: 1) "maximum number of tokens required to express any output in Y" - Is this just the maximum number of tokens that the encoder can input (e.g, 128 in BERT). and eq(4) with the l(x) being masked out, is equivalent to just LM without any tokens as context? (MASK throughout).   2) Could you clarify what is being compared at In Table 1; GPT3 scores are based on few-shot priming (no gradient steps taken), whereas PET is based on few-shot learning on 32 examples? (gradient step taken on every example)?

Sorry for the late reply, I haven't been using reddit for some while. With regards to your questions: 1) No. For example, let's say we have a text classification task with 3 labels and a verbalizer that maps these labels to "politics", "science" and "sports". If these words are tokenized as ["po", "lit", "ics"], ["science"] and ["sport", "s"], then the maximum number of tokens required to express any output would be 3 (als "politics" requires 3 tokens). So during training, we would always have 3 mask tokens even if the correct label requires only one or two masks. 2) Yes, exactly!

Great, I think I've interacted with your course in some capacity before. Not sure whether it was via this sub or from Google search directly. One question, considering how the field of NLP or AI in general is making leaps and bounds of progress on scale of months. How are you planning to keep it updated and structure it so that your effort maintains its value for a longer course of time?

Yeah that's a question that crossed my mind several times.   My approach was to focus on core concepts that are slow-changing. For example, the common preprocessing steps will be around for a while, so will building representations from neural networks, etc. Transformers are still going strong.   What's changing really fast are things like model capacity and tweaks to scale and augment models. My goal was to arm people with the ability to keep up with these developments.   My thinking now is that I'll release short-form content when there's a major leap forward. e.g. GPT-4, a new architecture that dethrones transformers, or a library/framework gaining mass adoption.   Thoughts or suggestions on what you'd find useful?

Nah, I think that question makes sense. The motivation changed over time from signaling to building a network to just proving to myself I can ship something hard. I have a history of half-finished projects. This is the first big thing I've ever shipped. It was really challenging and there were multiple plateaus. But now it's out there and I now trust myself that I can build and ship future projects.

So, it looks like you are using spaCy for your NLP processing - which is a new libarary to me. - How do basic nlp tasks in spaCy differ from nltk and why did you choose spaCy? - Does spaCy do the more advanced, transformer based processing like the huggingface libriaries? Since I'm not at that part of the course yet, what do you use there and why? I'm just trying to get a sense of why you made the choices you did, so I know what reasons to use one library vs another for my own projects.

IMO, spaCy offers a superior API and is designed for industry use. It lets you do a specific set of tasks that are common in NLP apps (PoS-tagging, NER, etc). NLTK is more of a general string processing library for academic exploration. Because the course focuses on getting NLP-related things done, I went with spaCy.   Yes, spaCy offers transformer-based pipelines that wraps the HuggingFace transformers library. https://spacy.io/usage/v3#features-transformers  I use spaCy mostly in part one. In part two, I switch to mostly Tensorflow/Keras/Hugging Face because: 1) There's sizable coverage of neural networks in general that is independent of NLP. 2) I wanted to show people a variety of tools.

I posted this elsewhere. I am not expecting a book length answer. More like "Dragon used buzz(word)1, and buzz2. Now thanks to buzz3 and buzz4 we do buzz5 and buzz6." What sort of hardware accelerator would help, if any?  I need terms to search on.  I will look into your course.  [D] Looking for terms of art, phrases to steer me toward focused searches for voice dictation/ voice to text using modern tools   DiscussionBackground:  I used to do embedded C, some C++, later Python for fun, took the Coursera machine learning course (using Octave) long ago, never studied NLP. I.e. clueless I wanted to fire up my old Dragon Naturally Speaking again for practical use.  Used it for work off and on for many many years.Here is what I thought: All the DNS old patents have lapsed.ML has grown by leaps and bounds. I hear of whisper AI and more. CoralAI TPU? Hardware and memory has grown also. There must be some open source or cheap alternative to DNS. BTW DNS has always been retail user hostile/nasty. I said over 15 year ago that I did not know you could turn cardiologists into an angry mob. No, I am not MD. What are some search terms that I could find in coursera to see what is currently being used and taught. Is it the same as taught in older NLP courses?Here is what DNS did.Test your mic and voice quality.Speak a provided set of sentences into the training part. Do your dictation. Including selecting a word or phrase, saying "correct that" or "spell that" and doing the correction, which DNS apparently learned. There were in line escape sequences like maybe "open paren" and "close paren"  or "start cap" and "end cap" and similar for numerals.

People, I hear you, but I think you need to get over it!  Being interested in language processing you should all know that natural language is full of ambiguity, there's no way around it. Usually, context helps to disambiguate, but it's hard to provide context when you only have three letters. You might think of the other NLP whatever you want, but there is no inherent right for one concept or field to be given privilege and right to use an acronym just because it's more serious or scientific or whatever criterion of worth you use. I think we just have to accept the fact that NLP on its own is not the best search term and maybe not the best name for a subreddit either. And that's probably how alternatives like nlproc have arisen.

I only learned of the embarrassing other meaning when someone almost mistook what I was talking about. I actually have a bigger issue with the poor choices of AI jargon in general, in this case the "Natural" part of "Language Processing", because human language doesn't come naturally, nor does the field cover languages of other natural animals. The field should just be called "language processing" since human languages are the default assumption.

The distinction in linguistics is between "natural" languages of humans and the "artificial" languages of computers.  Also most linguists will say animals have communication and not language itself.  So that's a bit of context where the term comes from. Language processing seems very vague.

Got it, thanks! Do you also have a good sense yet for the minimum use-able document length? Like are we talking paragraphs (which was my sense from traditional LDA and the newer STM methods a lot of social scientists use) or does it still work suitably on documents of only a sentence or two?

That will really depend on the vectorization/embedding model. There are definitely models for Sentence-BERT that will handle documents of a single sentence just fine. A single sentence, even a short one, per document, will be plenty as long as you have a decent number of documents. In fact it is longer documents that are harder for this approach -- the default Sentence-BERT and Universal Sentence Encoder settings tend to want "documents" of 512 or less tokens in length. There are definitely ways to treat longer documents, but that may require work, and BERTopic may not handle that by default.

This is cool, but because semantics is my specialty I have to ask: What in the world scale are you using to quantify “meaningful vector representations of text?” I know you don’t have a rule-based Peircean layer in your transformer, so how are you getting this and how are you quantifying it?

As it's your speciality you will likely have a more specific definition for this than I. For me, it depends on the use case, but from a generic but practical pov, I need pairs of sentences/Q&A/etc that are similar in meaning to be placed nearby in a vector space. To quantify that the correct pairs are being identified, a dataset containing pairs like STS, SQuAD can be used and we test retrieval performance with a metric like MRR@k or nDCG@k

I admit that after taking a look the BERTopic interface seems easier to use, and it's compatible with various types of embeddings. ETMs however are based on some more complex model in comparison to the tf.idf used in BERTopic.

Ohh interesting, it’s like using lda but you’re free to use word2vec embedding a instead of tf-idf?

Yes I'd summarize the idea like that  
BERTopic is the future of topic modeling in NLP
I had an opportunity to try it and the results were subpar. I tried the vanilla model along with the recommended fine-tuned models. Tried it on raw and processed data. My documents were relatively short (avg 7 sentences) perhaps that was my issue. I had better performance with graphing methods. That said, I didn’t catch the update thanks!

On the two examples I used here, it seemed to work well - however they are quite simple and I did fair amount of fine-tuning. But, I mostly put that down to still learning the library, so I'm expecting over time this will become easier I haven't tested the update yet but it looks really good imo

Honest question: did you fine-tune a model on your own data? I've largely found off-the-shelf embeddings to be hit or miss in almost any situation.

Have you tried top2vec, if so how would you compare the results for topic modelling between the two? u/jamescalam

Thanks for posting this. With some minor differences, this is the exact pipeline I've just started using in our project (SentenceTransformer, UMAP, HDBSCAN, c-tf-idf on reddit posts stored as arrow files) and I didn't know about this package. How did that even happen. Edit: Okay, this was already in my tabs. (:

You could certainly use chai to test our your chat bot! We're increasing support for feedback from users to developers, so this would be a great way to refine your Facebook chat bot. However, you would need to handle deploying it to Facebook yourself. Great question! If you have any more, feel free to contact us on Discord (https://discord.gg/YfrVwBtYWb).

Has anyone used this to have conversations with bots or like, make friends with an AI? I’ve seen a lot of people talking about Discord bots. But I think if you want to use Python or write some code you can host your own bot.  Or if you just want to chat download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play. 🚀

How do I create a personality for my bot yk?  
For me, I just made my prompt super long and the bot kinda picked up a personality based on the language and the punctuation I used, so my bot tended to type in all caps when nervous, scared, angry, or excited, and used lots of question marks when expressing confusion, and it ended up using slang and abbreviations like “lmao” or “btw” etc

When I ran the Babe Ruth example, it looked basically the same, but the parts of the edges weren't annotated, and it had this note:  Note: The edges represent the relationships between the nodes and the direction of the arrow denotes the direction of the relationship.  But it's all text, with no arrows. Full query:  convert this text into nodes and edges: Babe Ruth joined the New York Yankees in 1920. The Boston Red Sox sold his contract to the Yankees. He played for the Yankees from 1920 to 1934, and during that time he established himself as one of the greatest players in baseball history.

Thanks. Took a look at this while I was in line today, so good to know about this. Your application looks focused on the fine-tuning stage, but apart from quantizing, onnx looks to bring improvements to pretraining to?  
the library is only for inference, not for fine-tuning or pretraining, It exports an already pretrained torch model to onnx. (The onnx models can be converted to any other frameworks like TensorFlow, caffe2.. etc.) Then we can quantize the onnx for decreasing the model size (it also increases the inference speed). finally, the model is run on onnxruntime to speed up the inference. you can also train models on onnxruntime.

I worked at a big bank (which is way more hated than any tech firm I'd guess) and a big 4 accounting firm doing fraud investigation with NLP. I was never proud to say who employed me, but the work was good, particularly at the accounting firm. There's a lot of work in fraud investigation and compliance for people with NLP skills. The data concerns are generally minimal - I never saw any data other than company property (like employee corp emails/chats) and public stuff. Re FAANG, I'm not saying don't be concerned about the privacy stuff etc, but the organizations are so big that you can do a lot of good stuff there while staying away from questionable work. You might not be comfortable doing that, which would be totally fair, but that aspect is worth considering.

Any large organization (i.e. a few tens of thousands of employees) will benefit from NLP. Tons of value add from just piggybacking existing internal (and external) communications.  
Maybe the sarcasm is flying over my head but Grammarly is regarded by many as a glorified key-logger that also happens to do grammar corrections. It goes against everything that OP stands for  
It also reinforces all kinds of insidious prescriptive attitudes about language, and I would argue is harmful to nonstandard dialects.

Many news organizations like the New York Times (but also smaller orgs) employ data scientists to help extracted structured data from archival content, help moderate comments and recommend relevant articles to readers. Check out, e.g., https://open.nytimes.com/to-find-photos-in-our-archive-we-taught-the-cms-how-to-read-f9bd5f6703d7 Arguably, news orgs have some of the largest, cleanest corpora of socially-relevant text content of any company out there...

Google is really pretty good about privacy and design ethics, not perfect, but probably among the best of any company with significant data. Tristan Harris got his start because his presentation and ideas were popular within Google, after all. And there are a wide variety of roles, extending to pretty prosocial things like education and open source research and tools.

I'd dispute this, and I suspect this is exactly the kind of ethically questionable organization OP wants to avoid. Google is no Facebook, but it is a "surveillance capitalism" corporation. Moreover, more than half of their workforce are temps, contractors, or employed by third party vendor companies. These workers are paid a fraction of what their full time employee counterparts make, receive lesser benefits, have no job security, and many of them do the same work as FTEs.

Google has a lot of governance issues (like, they can't stop their execs from having sex scandals) but their business model depends on nobody else having the data they collect. So in a way, you can trust them not to give it out - the exception being legal requirements like government requests.

The TVC issue is real, although it's massively multimodal by role. Almost no SWEs are TVCs for example, I only heard of 1 the entire time I was there. The overwhelming majority of TVCs I met did things no FTEs did, like community management, support, branding/art. Although yeah, some really good people I met were TVCs in UX or PgM that I thought deserved to be FTE, and the line is very murky. If you're doing technical NLP work,  you are a FTE with almost no uncertainty. And calling it a "surveillance capitalism" organization means nothing, that's just a scary facade of a phrase with no substance. They collect data on people, yes. You can't even get access to it internally outside of extremely specific contexts though. The company as a whole is essentially antagonistic to the idea of amalgamating data from different sources together. They seem to have problems with government overreach, although I never saw that happen, and the general atmosphere was that people wanted to prevent that overreach. I was way more concerned about Google's data privacy until I worked there, which most people I know have also said, and have heard almost universally the opposite from people at FB. There's really no comparison between the two.

You’ll have to create your own dept at non large companies like the guy in Madmen that created tv marketing. Most businesses that are very large corporations, aren’t even going to have divisions or even know what NLP is/the capabilities of it. You have leverage to literally work anywhere, as long as you can illustrate to decision makers how your skills can help that specific company grow

This isn't quite true. Most large corporations definitely have data scientists including linguists, even if their work isn't public facing. I have a friend doing NLP for a large industrial manufacturing company. He works on things like analyzing maintenance records to tag each mention of a part with its specific model number.

Sure of course. But very much not mainstream. And sure tagging but sentiment analysis, nuance of reviews, intelligent chatbot creation for customer service.  Even TD Ameritrade just updated theirs to be more intuitive this year, and they are the leading tech brokerage out there.  Case in point-I worked for one of largest insurance brokerage agencies in nation and world. Top 20 in US. They just got electronic applications in late 2017 and still very very clunky. They still to this day don’t allow docusign for investment accounts.  Still many big life insurance companies are mostly paper apps. There’s OCR jobs out there too. Digitize easily and there’s a contract in there for you.  Smart business invest in DS and arcgis, marketing etc. But many just dont know and don’t. Covid showed us how many businesses were unprepared to go e commerce and ones that have excelled and have for years.

Given how little intelligence your post betrays (you have come to this conclusion based off of a highly sensationalized documentary without thinking very deeply about it, and you think you’d end up fine-tuning sentiment analysis models for engagement), you are probably not smart enough to work for FAANGs anyway. I suppose ethics is a good excuse for “explaining away” that fact, so yeah.. To answer your question: there are very many good employers in this space beyond bigger corps. Have you looked at non-profits, or perhaps news media like the Guardian/Economist with excellent data science depts, or startups? A simple Google, oh sorry I mean DuckDuckGo, search will do wonders.

Wow, that was really unnecessary. I hope that whatever is troubling you gets better tomorrow.
