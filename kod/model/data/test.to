Which place in the world sounds the most exotic or distant to the Vietnamese?  For example in my country the stereotype goes something like " It's as far as China" or "Timbuktu", is there something like that for you?  
 Probably USA. Vietnamese have a strange obsession with this country, and they think the "50 States" is best of the best. I'm not though, despite my father's family side are living there. Japan, because of the manga and anime that selling very well here. Africa. Whiten skin products loved by a lot of natives so anything dark is exotic for them.   
Do Vietnamese people hate Americans because of the war?  
No, of course they hated the war, but now they're very liked Americans, especially the Whites.  
 especially the Whites  Oh, lol  
It was so honest and un-pc i died laughing  
What do you think about the Korean war? Do you think that the US/UN should not have intervened, and let South Korea fall? What do you think about French involvement in Vietnam, compared to American involvement? Also, you referred to Saigon. Does anybody actually call it Ho Chi Minh City? Why do you think that the name “Saigon“ persist despite the official renaming?  
 I don't care and don't know about the Korean war. Vietnam is basically the twins with France, everything from appearances, behaves, feminism and patriarchy is deeply influenced by their. I like the term "Saigon" because, first, I was born in the decade that term was preferred over "Ho Chi Minh City". Also, I don't like Ho Chi Minh nor the government.   
Thanks! I wish you and your country the best. Edit: I asked about the Korean War because there are a lot of similarities and differences compared to the American war in Vietnam, but I can understand why it would be of little interest to you.  
Do you come from a rich, poor or middle class family?  
Middle class!  
What are some underrated things that you would recommend people to do or places to check out when visiting your country that usually get overlooked.  
I'm a Saigon city born so I recommend you go to the 3 famous parks that almost every city's kids (except the poors) were all used to visiting: Đầm Sen Park Suối Tiên Park Thảo Cầm Viên Park Every park has their own interesting and very different to each others.  
What do your fire hydrants look like ?  
Red! And not special or inferior to other countries' hydrants.  
Hah, sorry I didn't mean it in any way. I only realized recently other places have fire hydrants in different colours (white and green v. Red) so it was the first thing that came to mind. Have a good one !  
As someone who is ethnically Vietnamese, but born and raised in America, what do you think about us?  
To be honest I think nothing, I don't see Vietnameses are superior than any other asians like Thailands, Philippians, Japaneses,... I don't see Americans or westerners or africans or middle easterners are superior. So Vietnamese-American to me is just a person!  
Do you feel that your immediately neighboring country of Cambodia would have become more politically and economically stable if it had remained under Vietnamese occupation well into the 1990s as opposed to the UN becoming involved in post-conflict reconstruction, leading to the rise of Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party?  
I don't know much about the whole Cambodia's political and the world's general (politics would be the least thing of me interested in). I can only tell that, it's a joke to think Vietnam is a stable itself. Cambodia and even VN would have become a quite more stable if it is under France or Germany. Not count that Vietnamese seems very looking down at Cambodians for their poorer country and natural skin colors and idoling Korea and Japan for their richer and "fake" pale skin like a lot of VN using whiten creams.  
What are your favorite Vietnamese foods that you'd recommend people try?  
Umm, Bún Bò! You could have both beef Bún Bò and vegan Bún Bò. I'd eat it every day without sick of it.  
How do you feel about the French people? Do Vietnamese people have strong ties or feeling about France?  
I feel there is never a nation's people that so similar to Vietnamese as French. Vietnam women have feminism from French women, Vietnam men have patriarchy from French men. And do Vietnamese people have strong ties or feeling about France (Whites)? I think yes, since "Nhà Thờ Đức Bà Sài Gòn" is one of the most popular place.  
[deleted]  
I'm an introvert and a freelance onliner (job name is secret, but it is nice money and not that I do Onlyfans or sex jobs) and I don't have any partners or kids so my average day would be stay at home with my mom, who is an ambivert and can tolerate my quiet trait.  
Should I move there?  What is life like for an American expat?  
What Vietnamese dish do you recommend?  
Hi! I live in the USA and my best friend is Vietnamese, her mother was born in Vietnam and came here when my friend was one year old. She is like a second mother to me. She has been very sick and hasn't been able to go back to Vietnam in at least a decade and due to her health, she will never be able to go back.  I don't know if you can answer this question, but do you have any recommendations of what I can get her to remind her of home? She is around 70 years old. I haven't found any Vietnamese Online Stores that ship to the USA. Thank you!  
How much has French influenced your cuisine? This is something new I've been talking about with my colleague!  
Cool, you have people. I aspire to have people one day  
How does an average vietnamese consider trash? I love your country but the amount of trash and plastic is so sad to see. Are you bothered by it, or how do you feel? For an avarage vietnamese what is a rich/dream summer vacation destination? As for culture goes, what are the most exciting ones that vietnamese people love or would love to visit? What countries/nations that vietnamese love and what are that they usually hate?  
How are you handling the South East Asian heatwave? I lived in Malaysia, with a similar hot and sweaty climate to Vietnam, though I left before the heatwave started, how's it going?  
In the off chance I end up in Vietnam one day, where would you recommend for the best Vietnamese iced coffee? I really didn't expect to like it, but it's awesome!  
What makes Vietnamese food so good?  Have a favorite recipe?  
Not a question but I found Vietnam to be absolutely amazing with the nicest people  
so you still see a lot of the Vietnam war in Vietnam?  
Vietnam won a war against the USA, in order to keep a socialist government. Do you think that it was worth it? Do you consider the Vietnamese economy to be capitalist or something else? Especially compared to the nearby Chinese  
Why are Vietnamese so hot?  
Have you had any situations where a foreign diplomat did something shady and pulled the DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY card?  
We've had a few of their dependents try to pull the diplomatic immunity card but never for something serious. Most of the time it's to try and get out of traffic tickets or parking violations. Edit to add: while I've been here Unfortunately for them, they're not their parents and (typically) have much more limited immunity and if any of them pulled anything seriously criminal it's very likely we would either label them persona non grata or request  their home country to waive immunity.  
Which countries are the worst for that?  
It's always Spain and Austria. Korea has had a few but the Korean government was pretty easy to work with to resolve the dispute out of the courts.  
is that long term for bribe???!  
Heh. I worked in a university registrar's office in California and sat with the residency officer (California residency or the lack thereof controls how much tuition you pay).  I came in one day to find her tussling on the phone with the regional consul from a certain south Asian country trying to wrangle down his son's non-resident tuition.  He even asked if putting his son onhis  staff would get the tuition down!  
What was your job like during the height of the pandemic? Were there foreign dignitaries here or did they all go home?  
There were dignitaries here but with either digital or spaced contact depending on their home country and current US policy (which changed almost daily due to having to deal with multiple countries guidelines).  
My girlfriend just finished her master's degree in an international relations-related major and is working for a State Dept. contractor, what's the best way to get a role in the State Department itself?  
Ho early? If she's at a contractor and wants to transfer, depending on how long she's been at her current position, I'd apply. Especially if she has contacts in the State Department who can act as references.  
She's been at her current role for about seven months, and this is her first state department-adjacent role. She knows she's early on in her career and it can be extremely competitive to get in so she's not expecting anything soon, but I'm really proud of her for the work she's put in so far and I really want to see her make it. Any advice or encouragement for her would be much appreciated. I'll definitely pass on what you told me. Thank you so much.  
The best advice I can give is to actively seek out projects and try to network as much as possible. Getting a foot in the door is pretty much number 1 to getting in  
I'm sure you have experienced your share of office or inter-agency drama. What are the top three instances of this that you can tell us?  
 Dealing with DHS, literally anytime we have to deal with DHS.  Had an ICE office literally make us send almost two years of paper files, which were housed in DHS HQ to prove a dignitaries status. Which required us to have an agent physically go to DHS HQ to fill out paperwork to request them transfer an itemised list to us so that we could send them to ICE (and this is not the worst the red tape gets).  Firearms certs.  You always have that one person who complains about having to recert which then delays everyone as you have to pick up their workload while they retrain to meet cert. Just maintain your cert, it's not that difficult! I do enough as is in my position, I don't want to be doing your job.  Translators taking forever.  You're literally professional translators who hold near native fluency from DLI, why is it taking you a week to translate a simple car rental request from a hosting nation?  
Geez...reading this seems to give more evidence to the belief that even if you have a university degree, you still can be a bloody moron in the professional working world.  
Common sense is woefully uncommon in the professional world.  
Have you seen the new show The Diplomat with Keri Russell and if so what did you think of it? If not, what are you watching?  
I've not. Most recent show I watched was Night Agent and that needed a lot of suspension of disbelief.... but I rather enjoyed it otherwise.  
Is your current position what you consider to be your dream job? If not, what is the position that you want to obtain and keep until retirement?  
It's far from my dream job but my dream job only makes money for the extremely lucky who have a lot of connections with casting agents and such. So I'll take this boring office job that pays above average for my area.  
Is it typical to work 10hr days? How busy are you per shift? Considered switching to another role or department?  
Officially no. Realistically, you'll be fired if you don't meet strict deadlines. Especially if they're meeting with any higher profile officials in the government. Government doesn't wait for you to get your job done. But it's not really that busy if you stay on top of it.  
Have you ever had sex at this job?  
I haven't had sex in over 20 years because of trauma  
I have TRAUMA too.  
Are you hiring?  
Probably. Check careers.state.gov though warning you probably won't be making much.  
Soo…. Do you need to pass a drug test?  Is so, what kind of drugs are they looking for? Asking for a friend!  
We get subjected to random drug tests where they test for all illicit substances  
What's your take on weed?  Do you know folk that smoke at your job?  Do you care? Should the government care?  
Do you steal toilet paper from work? How about pens? Do you steel pens? Do they give you lunch at work or do you bring your own?  
I've not stolen any pens or toilet paper. I typically bring my own lunch.  
Was your degree in International Affairs or something similar? Do you work domestically or abroad, and do you ever have a “grass is greener” feeling about people who work in one type of posting or the other?  
My degree is in business administration with a minor in sociology. I work in a DC office and I've made a few visits to the White House in the time I've been with the department (and yes, I've met the Trumps and Bidens... it sort of loses any specialty after a while). I kinda feel like most jobs in the State Department are pretty boring. But you get to meet interesting people. Sometimes I wish I could transfer to be a Foreign Security Agent but they don't get paid nearly enough for what they do. I still have yet to make it to AF1 (it's never gonna happen, but it would be so cool if it did).  
Is this secretly an ad to get people to check out careers with State Dept?  
Trust me, you get paid pennies for the work you do compared to private sector admin jobs. It's only really a good job for people who are fine with giving a little bit on salary in order to get predictability and security. I have a job for life as long as I don't get fired. The only time that wasn't a guarantee was when we got a memo after a certain November saying 80% of us would be fired in order to "clean house" None of us were fired.... except for Michael but he deserved it. Edit: I should add I make about $123k/yr, private sector I could likely get double that if I had similar connections to get in like I did with the state department (my parents worked as foreign dignitaries to Italy and later as Economic Analysts for the CIA).  
Oh I get it. That predictability and security are enticing to me and I’ve taken a look in the government sector a few times. But I don’t wanna live in the DC-area.  
I live in Alexandria and commute to DC. Plenty of cities and towns within commuting distance in Virginia and Maryland.  
I learned about slugging many years ago, thought it was such an interesting concept. I’m not ready to leave private sector yet either but I definitely entertain and check the career pages for different govt branches time to time.  
Wait, are you saying the private sector would pay $250k for similar role?  
For a similar role with similar networking, yes. I mean at a private company it would be an upper management job.  
Any tips for someone wanting to work a job like that?  I always try to apply to jobs via USAJOBS site but man, I'm just never selected. I'll take any state department job at this point. Or any decent gov job 😅  
You really need an in. Networking is the name of the game. I'd say try to get a job with a contractor and make as many connections in the State Department as possible. Then apply with them as a professional reference. In-house references are an easy way to get an interview. If you get the interview, depending on which sector or department, expect to be asked questions related to your prior clearances, history of drug use, and any criminal or delinquent behaviour you've ever partaken in going back to childhood. They're not looking for you to be spotless, but honest.  
Thanks for the information and response. I should have known it's about all about networking and connections. I guess I'll keep trying. I had no idea about contractors or what they do but I'll look into it. Thanks for the advice.  
No questions, just a bit jealous of your boring job. I have a role that is a mix of HR, office administrator, and sysadmin that makes me wanna tear my hair out at least twice a day. Pay is great and my colleagues are great, but the vendors and our technicians really go out of their way to kill my vibe Monday thru Friday lol. I work so much overtime 😩  
You have vendor and tech issues. I have to coordinate allowing our vendors and technicians in the building because somebody (not naming names cough Evanna cough) forgot to process their clearance applications. It's not actually that bad.... when people do their jobs. It's when they forget to do their jobs that you start to have issues.... or when your boss is completely incompetent and changes your work policies almost daily to spite foreign leaders who called him names (again, not naming names but you can probably guess)  
I feel ya. That clean up stuff makes me wanna tear my hair out. Just do your danged paperwork!! Operations doesn't enforce a lot of the policies we have put out for vendor relationships or for the technicians in the field, so I end up having to play clean up and rush to cut invoices that I had no idea were due or process a new employee's paperwork that I did not know was being hired or brought on.  My job would still be busy, but it would be less stressful if other people cared to cross their t's and dot their i's.  
Have you been working there long enough you’ve experienced both parties in power? Any difference?  
Yes I have. There's major differences and I take issue with both parties. However I much prefer one over the other for reasons.  
Où est la salle de bain?  
Dans l'hall da droite.  
Merci  
Hey, your job actually sounds kinda intriguing.  Why don't you go overseas and work at an Embassy or Consulate?  I bet those assignments are more interesting.  
Do you see a lot of waste of taxpayers' funds there that likely wouldn't occur in a private business?  
I see a lot of waste of taxpayer funds, however much of it would still occur at a private business.  
Do you feel any guilt about manipulating young bitches?  
Hey hey don’t kink shame me  
Is dog grooming your dream job? If not, what is?  
I’ve always wanted to own my own business and work with dogs, so in a way yes 100% it is. But I’m naturally very lazy and I adore performing so my absolute dream job would probably be something like actress, etc Edit: not saying actresses are lazy, they’re absolutely not. I just love performing and being in the spotlight and the money would be a great bonus!  
did you ever had any crazy/weird requests from your clients?  
Someone did recently request their dog to have a mullet, and I did it! It was great fun and the dog looked cute as heck  
Damn i wish you had a picture of that, how do you deal with aggressive dogs?  
here you go! Usually, I don’t deal with aggressive dogs. My hands are what make my money, so I don’t risk a bite. If the dog shows genuine aggressive behaviour that I can’t control with a muzzle/calming hammock, I will stop the groom and advise they try somewhere with multiple groomers, or vet sedation if the dog is very bad. I have managed to calm aggressive dogs though if the owners are compliant with regular visits and desensitisation at home.  
Heh heh heh that a cool mullet, what's your top 3 favorite dog breeds?  
What are you drinking that has gotten you "kinda drunk"?  
Kopparberg ciders and passion fruit gin mixed with lemon squash (or cordial if you’re not from the UK)  
What dog would be the best drinking buddy?  What does is the best to groom? Worst?  
What are 3 wild stories you can tell us that occurred in your life so far?  
Okay so I don’t have the focus to type loads right now but I’ll give brief overviews:   My dog, granddad and rabbit all died on one day  I accidentally flashed everyone in a cathedral when I was like 14  I got to hug Derren Brown?? Idk if that’s wild but I can’t think of a third one lnao   
How's your evening been?  
you're not that famous youtube one, are you?  
What the hell is your favorite movie?  
Dog groomer? Thats sick  
Hello fellow groomer!  
Were you holding it in your hands? With your feet? In your mouth or some other orifice?  
actually the spoon was in me and i didn’t realize it until I became older and had to start working  
Do you still have the spoon?  
No, the spoon will disappear when I graduate uni because they’ve “given me the education I need already, everything i achieve from here on out has to be completely on my own”  
What or where do you plug into? Do you have a vampire guide?  
it's a vr world, everything is simulated in your headset.   and to become a vampire you have to steal energy from others til you transform, it's pretty pleasurable.  
Oh, that’s hot!  
Can you give me a red pill  
go to  a mental hospital and take meds.  
Whatever  
Why are you a Norwegian?  
A random coincidence  
Of the Scandinavian countries Denmark, Finland, and Sweden - which do Norwegians seem closer to and least closer to? Do you have family in the US? What do you think of towns in the US that have Norwegian festivals? I know here in Kansas City their is a Norwegian group of persons of Norwegian heritage. They get together and practice speaking the language and discuss events back in Norway.  
Closest to Denmark. Norway was under Danish rule for hundreds of years. Language is based on Danish.  Least to Finland. Finland does it’s own thing and are closer to Estonia than any Nordic country. (Finland is not a Scandinavian country, it’s Nordic) I do have family in the U.S. They live in Minnesota! Norwegian-Americans are great! In fact, they’re the only ones who keep the «old traditions» going. Folk dancing and such is not something we do here any longer.  Norway’s constitution day was May 17th so I’d imagine there was a parade and such in Kansas City.  
Do you like it over in Norway? Overall, do you view Sweden or Finland in a more positive light?  
I like it here. I view Sweden in more positive light due to having more connections to them.  
are job salaries satisfying enough to afford whatever you want?  
Salaries are high. I currently make 480 000 NOK ($43k) a year. However, inflation is high at the moment and prices have increased more than the average salary.  
How open is Norway to immigration? Are there job vacancies for engineers? Is the weather too harsh on major cities? How old are you?  
I’m 26. I don’t know anything about immigration to Norway but you can read about it here Engineer jobs are always open! Summer in Norway is wonderful! Winters are long and harsh (worst in Northern Norway)  
Many thanks. How difficult do you think it is for a norwegian to learn german? I'm asking this because besides my native language and english I know some basic german and I know there are great differences (being, if course an entirely different languange) but also many shared roots and some vocabulary in common, so it may give me an idea of how difficult it could be gor me to learn norwegian.  
Norwegians have the choice to learn German when starting 8th grade. In addition to English, German is probably the easiest language to learn for Norwegians I would say.  Not many people can speak it fluently though.  
Nynorsk or Bokmål?  
Bokmål  
Hotdogs with shrimp salad - yum or yuk?  
Yum? I guess. But in an interesting way  
Did you do that high school grad thing with all the weird challenges? I lived in Stavanger and saw all the kids in their blue overalls going bananas, looked like so much fun!  
Yup, it’s called «Russe-feiring». It’s fun but I think it’s gone way to extreme these days.  
Some of the challenges I read about did seem pretty extreme 😅  
Absolutely! Some are harmless fun as well but to much has become lethal stupidity  
Are you a Viking?  
Only when no one is looking  
Fair enough.  
Krumkaker or Fattigman?  
Krumkaker! Yum!  
Okay then… salmon with dill, or lutefisk? 🤣  
Hmmm. You made it difficult with this one! Salmon with dill takes it  
Fjords, am I right?  
Fjords. Fjords everywhere!  
Do you like Lutefisk?  
Yes  
I heard you guys ferment fish underground? Or was my buddy just screwing with me?  
In the old days that was the process. Due to lethal bacterias that is not allowed anymore.  What you do instead is; take a lid and add weight on it  
Have you been to this Norway tourist attraction called "Pulpit Rock". It looks scary.  
How safe is it? Like actually. I want to give it a go but I'm scared 😅  
I wont give you the standard sales pitch that it is safer than driving a car, but among air sports, it is pretty safe. It definely "feels" very safe I havent had a passenger who was so scared that we had to land, people are sometimes anxious at first but enjoy it after a couple of minutes on the other hand, from personal experience, I have tried paragliding and I was horrified all the way through. I think am actually too spoiled from the comfort and safety of my balloon. Go for it.  
Thank you for your honesty. I think I'll give it a try over the Hunter Valley 😊  
What does a new hot air balloon cost?  
Depends on the size but the most common ones are for 5-6 people and cost about 50k USD. Most pilots are flying passengers so we get some or ideally most of that cost back during the lifetime of our balloon the cost can be further reduced by having advertisements on the balloons envelope. You can get a new smaller one for less but it is not really economical for passenger flights so it ends up being the costly option. You can also buy a used balloon which is common or possibly even make the balloon yourself although it is rare.  
To follow up on this, what's the operating cost per hour?  
What do you eat while you're flying? What do the controls look like for the burner?  
The flight usually last about an hour so I dont have to worry about getting hungry. We do however offer small snacks to passangers before the flight while we inflate the balloon, usually sweet buns and also cofee or tea. After the flight we serve champagne. You can think of burner as sort of like a regular grill. The burner unit consist of a fuel source, a pilot light, and a burner valve. The burner burns propane but unlike the on a grill it burns liquid propane not vapors. We can control the intensity of the flame and adjust its direction. There are gauges that monitor fuel and pressure.  
Aha. I had not fully grasped the nature of the burner. I thought it would have burned gaseous propane (if it used propane at all), for some reason. "Intensity of the flame" - is that like a throttle in a piston engine (controlling both air and fuel flow, proportionally)? Actually, I figure I should just use a search engine for all this. What's your favourite thing to eat while on the ground?  
How do you pilot a hot air balloon?  Isn't it just up and down, then you're at the mercy of the wind?  
Yeah basically, but we do have some level of horizontal control by knowing where the wind is blowing. We have meteo forecast and we release a small party balloon just before the flight to check the winds that is usually enough for passenger flights.  There are balloon competitions where pilots chose a target and fly towards it from several kilometers away and sometimes come within just meters. They use the above mentioned meteo forcasts and helium balloons and to check for winds below them they drop something very light like shaving cream, popcorn etc. There are even live meteo data nowadays. But even with all of this having simple luck still plays the largest part.  
That's actually fascinating, thank you. As a balloon enthusiast, how do you feel about inflation?  
I hate to see the economy ballooning out of control!  
So if the winds changed direction suddenly and unexpectedly, sending balloons into a dangerous direction (miles of woods, ocean etc) what do you do? Or is it just about choosing a launch area where there is always an alternative landing spot?  
Ever had any accidents, near misses or panic moments?  
I have not had any accidents so far. I have had several encounters with powered paragliders and drones flying too close for comfort around my balloon which definitely raised my heart rate quite a bit though.  
how did you get into the profession?  
Does it have any impact on the environment that you know of? Just curious  
It uses propane which is clean burning and considered environmentaly friendly. You can probably make an argument that it uses a lot of propane which production has its own environmental costs. But still the impact will be pretty negligible. I would say ballooning is definitely more environmentaly friendly than airplanes (even the sport ones) and helicopters. One thing that I wonder though, is if it has an environmental impact on animals, especially birds. I have noticed that birds really freak out when they see a balloon in the air. They seem to be okay with other aircraft, but they really dont like balloons. so there is that, but again pretty minor thing.  
How many people are needed for launch and recovery?  
A lot depends on the wind speed during the inflation but the standard is three people. Two people hold the mouth of the balloon during the inflation and another person, usually the chase vehicle driver, holds the crown line to prevent the balloon from rolling around on the ground. The crown line is a line that goes from the top of the balloon, the crown. For packing up after flight more people to do the work faster. The balloon needs to be then loaded onto a trailer and that can take several people in some cases.  
I see these festivals where they launch dozens maybe hundreds of balloons at the same time. Whats the biggest festival you've ever been a part of? Also what keeps all those balloons from hitting each other? Do they actually work better in cold weather?  
I have actually been part of the biggest balloon festival in the world where over 1000 balloons participated. The festival is called Lorraine Mondial Air Ballons it is held every two years in France.  The balloons when next to each other float in the same mass and even if they bump by their envelopes (the balloon part) it is harmless, it is called kissing. But the dangerous thing is envelope and basket touching, when one balloon is ascending into a basket of another balloon above it the bottom balloons envelope can very easily rip. The bottom balloon does not see above it therefore have the right of way and the above balloon have to wach out. Yes, hot air balloons are all about temperature differential and work best in cold weather. The balloon records for duration or distance for example are always set in winter for that reason.  
Do most ballons have a way to turn? If so how?  
The bigger balloons with large baskets can turn around around its axis by releasing air from special slits on the envelope. The pilot can rotate the balloon and its large basket so that the passengers from the other side of the basket can see a particular landmark. But more importantly it is used to rotate the larger basket so if the balloon drags on the ground when winds are faster it drangs on the longer side on that rectangular basket. If you meant like turning to change the horizontal direction then we only have winds that change course at different altitudes. How to find those winds I have already covered in another answer (basically meteo forecasts and releasing small helium balloons)  
Given that the way it flies sounds really simple from a scientific standpoint, are you afraid of how easily something could just stop working and the flame would stop? Are there any failsafes or would you just start falling? You know how machines sometimes randomly stop working for seemingly random reasons or for no reason at all. So what do you do is something just stops in the burner?  
Could the balloon have made it out of Oz?  
Who has been the biggest jerk you’ve encountered thus far and what did they do?  
The guy in front of me in one screening started recording voice notes and then got incredibly angry when people started telling him to stop.  
Huh. You would think all the people at Cannes would have actually have been to a movie theater before but here we are.  
Smaller festivals that's what is happening usually, ppl taking notes, leaving early to make another screening. They're there to "shop" for projects for their companies  
Where does a person find a safe source? Asking for a friend.  
That's a tough one. Try to participate in alternative social circles (progressive rock-heads love that shit for example). Meet lots of people. Build confidence with at least someone who's consuming. They may be your source, LOTS easier said than done. I've personally met people who have been hanging out in the right circles and haven't found a supplier in more than a decade. I got lucky I found someone early.    Also, easier to find in bigger cities.  
Look into LSD analogues. You can get stuff like 1p-LSD, Eth-LAD etc. These analogues are almost the exact same as taking real tabs. They are usually pro drugs, meaning your body converts it to LSD after ingesting. If anything, I actually like getting this stuff better because you’re ordering it online (you can find vendors out of Canada or Europe) and it’s dosed accurately. If the tab says 150mcg then it is, not like buying on the street and the guy says “these are double dipped hits, they’re really strong” when it’s really a 75mcg tab  
I always felt that acid trips went on too long. I would enjoy the first 3 or 4 hours then I just wanted to come down. I haven't done it in years. Will, on occasion, do mushrooms in the right setting. How do you feel about the duration of a trip?  
Oof tell me about it. I try to take a tab early on the day so I can rest at night. Taken too late in the day and sleeping will be impossible. If necessary I'll take a sleeping pill to cut the trip short.  
Pancakes or French toast?  
Generally, pancakes. If French toast's well made, then French toast.  
How much does acid cost these days?  
Between $8 and $15 per tab afaik  
did you ever have a challenging experience and if yes, why? if thats not too personal.  
First time I did acid I laughed uncontrollably for like 3 hours straight. It was definitely awkward, as I was in a public setting. I was in this kind of bar though so I didn't stand out at all though lmao. After that, most other challenging experiences came in the form of unavoidable interaction with out of trip people. Trying to talk to normal people when you're tripping balls is hard. I keep to myself and my trip buddy most of the time.  
Have you had those Gamma Goblin acid tabs yet?  
what's thatttt  
Just some well known LSD that's been going around.  
I’m on acid right now hehehe hello  
Greetings from beyond the plane  
I only took about 50mg but it was nice and loosey goosey and fun :)  
Do you paint or draw or do anything artistic when on acid?  
I enjoy writing but I personally don't like doing it while on acid. I'd just write non-sense. I rather just stay outdoors and appreciate nature. I could try drawing but I'm not good at it. Yesterday I went to a contemporary art museum during the peak of the trip. One of the most amazing experiences I've had.  
constantly?  
Once a month on average  
Isn’t the definition of an incel young men who are deeply misogynistic and hostile towards women. I guess “involuntary celibacy” you could technically call yourself an incel. Also why would you call yourself autistic if you haven’t been clinically positive for autism? If your family and peers call you that I would highly consider changing the people around you.  
Incel = involuntary celibate. Doesn't have to be a misogynistic young man necessarily.  
Just my opinion, I know u dont mean it the bad wau... but as a heads up so as not to disqualify yourself from potential friends and romantic/sexual interests, don't call urself an incel. Calling urself an incel in public settings generally means that you believe you are entitled to women's bodies and sex with them (big ew!). It does not actually refer to the literal, simple meaning, that you're a virgin or having an extended period without any sexual intimacy. U could say 'its been a while' or u havent had sex yet so you dont push others away. If you say incel girls are just going to think, wtaf?!  I hope u find someone soon!  
While you are true, incel is usually used to describe the misogynistic mindset that these men adopt in which they blame their inability to get into a relationship or similar on all the women instead of looking at their own personality and actions  
Weird way to categorise yourself regardless considering the overwhelmingly negative association of that term.  
Do you think a bear could beat a gorilla in a fight?  
Yes  
I mean as other people have said here, you're not really an incel. The literal expansion of the contraction is involuntary celibate, sure. But that's not what society understands when you use that term. Incel is a term used for those who are involuntarily celibate AND ascribe to the "red-pill" philosophy and its variants. If you say to someone "I am an incel" they will likely back away slowly. If you say to someone "I'm still a virgin because I have not had any luck dating", they're going to understand that completely differently. They'll also probably point out that this is a Wendy's, sir. In any case, your life experience is different enough to mine that I'm not going to offer any suggestions. Are you happy being single?  
8.5 and never had a girlfriend?  
Never even met another lesbian irl before  
Aren’t there Pride Month events in your part of California?  
So when you get a car and find a girl then you're not an incel anymore?  
I don't think getting a car would make me not incel anymore. But finding a girl would.  
Why would you look different on the outside of you had gotten laid?  
Did you get a lobotomy?  
Not this time.  
I’d rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy!  
A bottle of what?  
Anything! Whiskey? Beer?  
Have you listened to Danny DeVito on the Sunny podcast talking about being cast in Cuckoo's Nest? Its quite the tale.  
I have not but I will. Thanks for the heads up. The movie is outstanding.  
what was your first automobile?  
And the name of the city you were born in  
Getting a bit specific here. I was born and still live in South Africa.  
Nononono my dude. Don’t actually answer!  We’re joking around about hacking your accounts.  
Whatever dude. Come and find me. We’ll do coffee.  
Toyota Corolla. Probably a late 80’s model.  
cars back then cars were all unique. folding headlights, automatic seat belts, never knew what side to park when getting gas.  
This one didn’t have any of those bells and whistles. But yes. I prefer older cars. I currently drive an 11 year old Honda. It just keeps going.  
Are you enjoying the movie? I almost watched it for the first time last night, but went with the Irishman instead. Great movie.  
I’ve finished watching it. I would probably put it in my top ten of all time list. Highly recommended.  
High praise indeed.  
Medicine time!  
Amazingly haven’t needed any meds so far.  
What was the surgery?  
I had a large lipoma removed.  
Where was it? Are you diabetic?  
On my side. No I am not diabetic, are you?  
Nope I don't.  People who have diabetes often get lipomas. Hope you have a good day, the sun is shining in CT, it's icy cold and clear skies. One flew over the cuckoo's nest one of my favorites.  
A fabulous movie  
Superb.  
Have you read the book?  
I have not. Have you?  
I read the first few pages.  
That's quite an undertaking!  Well done :D I cheaped out and got most of my 400k karma from my kid being his awesome self :D  Now we can swim in pools and pools of reddit karma..  
I cannot imagine the hours you’ve spent looking at pics of people’s pets. What are some obscure subs I should take a look at? How many subs have banned you?  
so many pets. i like /r/specializedtools not sure how obscure it is but it’s interesting to see how creative our species is. started with a rock and now we’re all here. i’ve been banned from two or three? r/interestingasfuck banned me because they thought one of the post was not interesting (subjective af) and r/politics don’t remember the reason but it was years ago  
Dumb ban  
How do you feel about Reddit now compared to how it used to be?  
Wow congrats on your achievement!  Do you think you could have had done it in a shorter span? What do you think is the essential element in posting and commenting to make it interesting for getting loads of karma?  
How many hours total do you think you've spent on reddit?  
Yeah nice try. I'm not going to comment just so you can ghost me. Not today!  
Haha, you haven't been chosen to become the ghosted one  
Ok whew 😅  
😂 😂  
Which family members have you ghosted?  
What impact has Luca Brecel had?  
Are Belgians as obsessed with bicycle racing as they’re rumored to be?  
Obsessed? No. It is somewhat popular but personally I don’t believe in competitive sport.  
What do you think about africans  
In what sense do you mean? I’m somewhat curious about African cultures, I’ve been to Maroc and enjoyed myself, and I am very opposed to racism, xenophobia and imperialism if that’s what you mean.  
What is there to do in Brussels and Antwerp and which is better  
Would you happen to have a good waffle recipe? I just got a waffle maker and can’t wait to try it. I’d love to make a Belgian waffle.  
Is yo mama so gay she can’t even drive straight?  
She actually used to be a pilot, lol. She's not bad at driving but she's terrible at parking the car, she backed into a tree a few months ago.  
That is really cool that she was a pilot.  I just saw the opportunity and knew I’d never forgive myself if I didn’t take it.  
Don't ask me how she could land a plane though. I guess as long as she didn't have to reverse she was okay. As a bonus my dad was a mechanic so there used to be this constant cycle of her backing up into something and him having to fix it.  
That’s the beauty of aviation. The one thing every plane does is land.  You never mentioned they were soft landings though…  
Yo mama's so gay, she makes Ellen DeGeneres look straight ( meant as a joke )  
How do you feel about it? How did you come to be in this scenario?  
It took me a while to understand it, but I was never against it. Her partner is lovely, like I genuinely consider her my own mother just as much as my biological mom. I think she had to keep it a secret growing up because her parents were very conservative and it got to a point where her and my dad were getting along really well but felt pressured to be in a romantic relationship, so I think both of them were happier to divorce and remain platonic friends. So for a few years I was a bit confused, but never upset by it.  
So how did she get pregnant with you? Does her partner have legal rights as a parent/guardian with you?  
She got pregnant with me when she was with my dad. See, they only divorced after I was born, they remained friends and all. My dad died a couple of years ago and after that her partner adopted me so yeah, she actually is my legal parent now.  
You’re a hero. When I was at my lowest point I tried to kill myself. A therapist counseled me for free over multiple sessions. At that time, I really needed proof that someone on this planet cared about me and not just money. She saved my life. She didn’t have to do what she did. I’ll never forget her.  
Thats a Noble cause, glad you're doing better and thanks for passing by!  
Are you getting paid to be a therapist now?  
Not yet. Still wanting to help for free.  
This is very noble of you, thank you for being supportive of the needs of your community!  
Thank you for the kind words :)  
No problem 😊 I've only ever been on the receiving therapy side of things but having a good therapist helps so much.  
How did you afford costs while working for free?  What led you to do this work? What caused you to stop?  
Being a therapist isn't my main job so it was mostly costing my time and mental efforts.  As an introvert a key skill I have is introspection, it helps understanding others tremendously. I still work occasionally when possible, even for family.  
Interesting! Are you licensed?  
Not yet, mostly training until I feel ready  
How to be a therapist?  
Depends on the education system but I believe any college degree in the psychology department or a diploma.  
I can only really speak for the UK because that's where im from but in the UK you need a specialist qualification to be a therapist. You absolutely cannot become a therapist just with a psychology degree. I believe the system is similar in the USA Source: I'm an aspiring therapist with a degree in psychology and counselling and am looking to start my therapy qualification in the coming year or two  
how did you establish yourself and get clients? this is something i want to do as well to give back.  
Well my interest started with my family and colleagues as well as helping others online you can spread from there; Especially If you are pursuing a real career then you should seek the requirements your country lists, degree, etc. If you just want to return the favor, you can post educational content on your preferred platform if like you want to help on a bigger scale because that's what some do nowadays, people will start to reach out for advice and the community grows and such.  
What degree do you hold to do this?  
Psychology  
What kind of performers work on cruise ships?  
Lots of different types. My wife is a singer and dancer, but there are also stand-up comedians, magicians, compares, children’s entertainers, ect.  
In a year, how long is she away from you?  
In the first year she was away from home for 10 months. I’m not going to to lie that it was really tough on both of us and she nearly quit a couple of times. She follows a pretty basic pattern of 5 months on, 1 month off. Of course within those 5 months she would get a few weekends off (thankfully our home city is a popular port destination and so she could spend those weekends at home or if not I’d take a short flight out the wherever she was docked) but that’s roughly how it went. After doing a year she got some privileges that meant in the quieter winter season I was able to join her for around 5 months. I’m lucky enough to work remotely(I did this even before the pandemic) so I lived with her on her ship and worked from there. It was certainly an experience. Now because it’s summer and the high season it’s a bit trickier to do that plus I’ve also had a lot of travel for work in the last few months which is a bit unusual, but she has September off and then I’ll be joining her again in October.  
Is the cruise ship industry doing anything to be less heinous to the environment? I'd love to go on a cruise, but the polluting (well, and the tales of norovirus) are scaring me off.  
 Is the cruise ship industry doing anything to be less heinous to the environment?  To be honest, I doubt it. I don't think most of the people running these businesses high up have a lot of ethics. I read this story a while back, so I'm certainly aware of the issues though: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/08/massive-tax-exempt-cruise-ships-damage-environment. Personally, I would never have considered going on a cruise if it wasn't for my wife's job. I much prefer independent travel. And actually, as you mention it the norovirus tales are very real. If one person has it, you ca be pretty sure most of the ship is coming down with it. My wife's been working on cruise ships for two years now and has already had 3 pretty awful bouts of stomach flu.  
Eef! I'll continue to stay away, then. Here's hoping your wife stays safe and breaks out soon.  
Yep. Apart from the being away from home obviously I think my wife would probably say that’s one of the worst parts of the job. There constantly seem to be illnesses going around the workers onboard.  
Do you have kids? Are you knit concerned that she’s hanging out with hunky male dancers 90% of the time? What do you do for a living?  
No we don’t have children yet, but it is something we are seriously thinking about in the near future and obviously if and when it does happen that will change things.  I don’t worry too much honestly. We’ve been a couple for over 10 years now and I trust her and she trusts me. It’s certainly difficult spending all that time away from each other, and it does put pressure on our relationship at times but I understand why it’s important for my wife to be doing this.  Without doxxing myself as I work in a small field, I work as a researcher for a research institution in Europe.  
Favorite travel destination?  
Gosh I don't know. I really enjoyed America when I was there tbh.  
Oh America is fun! What part did you go to?  
Maryland Washington state. Also visited Washington as well.  
Oh hey i live in Washington! Small world  
Why did you start? Why did you stop?  
Started because I enjoyed sex and someone I was sleeping with said why don't you eacort and make money. So I tried it and then of course the money was a factor. Stopped cause I guess I just got burnt out by it and wasn't enjoying it anymore  
What did you learn about men while you were doing it?  
Hmmm gosh I don't know.... that men will pay for anything lol honestly I was gonna say that men are desperate but I met some lovely guys including men who were on leave in army etc and just didn't want to have to look for sex for ages.  
How did you feel opening the door for your first appointment? Scared? Excited?  
What where your rates?  
So baring in mind this was like gosh over 10 years ago. I changed up to £80 a hour and £50 or so for half hour.  Obviously I had more rates for multiple hours but I forget those now. Sometimes I did offers or discount android a hour for £60  
Did you ever have a favorite or least favorite client? Any stories about either?  
I mean I made a good friend from escorting who I'm still in touch with today so won't mention him. He is a older dude I'm not attracted to him he wss just a genuinely nice person.  I do always remember this really muscular man who had his cock pierced he was obviously memorable to me. And another dude I liked seeing who I saw alot was a scouse (I actually hate the accent) but he was a really nice genuine guy. I remember telling him that I was giving it up and he was so upset. We didn't keep in contact.  There was a few I hated. I remember one dude I seen a few times mega unattractive to me. And he used to always show of all the money he had literally hundreds of notes.  I used to wish I was bad enough to try steal of him but im to nice lol. I hated seeing him I just didn't have any thing good to say about him.  You probably wonder why I saw him more than once but it was safer to meet people I'd seen before and so I just did it for the money.  Another guy I hated was one who fell in love with me. I did finally cut him of and block him because he began to repulse me.  Sometimes I just had to close my eyes and think of the money ya know. Its not like I was one of the high end escorts who look like models. I was a average bigger woman lol. So I couldn't afford to pick and choose loads.  
how would you have reacted if a man paid the full price but wanted to just cuddle?  
I'd have obliged and gave him the best possible cuddle ever lol. Just to note I was also until quite recently a professional cuddler and got paid to give cuddles lol. Haha.  
Do you think escorts in general are okay with it? How common is it for escort clients to want just to cuddle? Professional cuddler sounds awesome! How might a cuddling session look like?  
OK with cuddling? I'm sure loads would be as it's less work after all lol.   I don't have alot of time as have to dash very soon. But a typical cuddling session would start with me offering them a brew (tea, coffee) or cold drink.  Baring in mind I will have already got there specific likes and dislikes regarding cuddle positions already sorted out. Then usually they tend to get into what there comfortable in. Usually they took there jeans of and shirt and left boxers and a vest on or something.  After that we get into the first comfortable position and start to hold each other and also sometimes some caressing in a platonic way of course. We can talk or not it's up to them. Also sometimes we may watch something like a film etc. Then throughout the meet we change positions a few times depending on what they enjoy. And that's pretty much it. Once session ends they get dressed and thank me again. (Oh they pay before the cuddle I forgot to mention) and then we say our goodbyes. Simple easy and friendly 😌  
What happened?  
I was tired of hating myself and feeling like I was invisible. I had a hard time making friends in high school, I would try to talk to people but I mean I was both overweight and too depressed to put effort into my appearance otherwise so I pretty much just looked like a slob all the time. Nobody wanted to be friends with me back then and I can't blame them though I like to believe I would never treat anyone else the way I was treated because of their appearance  
That sucks, I'm sorry about that :s How are you doing nowadays?  
People treat me better, I still don't have a lot of friends but that's my fault since I'm a hermit lol. But just in public it's a lot different and people actually talk to me  
My overweight mother thought that if a girl has weight issues, it means that they had issues with their mothers. Do you think that there is some truth to this? Also, have you ever talked with a therapist?  
Honestly, yes. Disordered eating runs in my family, but since none of my relatives have anorexia specifically and more just the general yo-yo dieting and unhealthy outlooks on food, they consider it to be normal. Which it is sadly in our culture.  Both of my parents were overweight when I was as well but my mom has lost weight since then. They was never malicious towards me or made any rude comments, just wanted the best for me, but I was never raised with the fundamental understanding of nutrition.  I just ate fast food every day even when I wasn't hungry, my parents don't cook so it was either that or frozen junk food and such.  
Do you have a support system in place? Recovery fucking sucks, but you deserve to feel good in your body.  
I mean, kinda? Not really. I don't think I'm ready to recover which I know is probably a bad thing to say  
Are you underweight currently?  
No </3 I'm really short so for the "underweight" bmi I would have to be 90 pounds or something which I am not and never will be tbh  
So you're not actually anorexic then 🙄  
Yeah pretty much  
Since you’ve experienced both sides of the spectrum, which one is more preferable?  
One million percent I prefer myself now. It's not even comparable - I'm a "healthy weight" rn just not emotionally healthy, but I feel really good about myself sometimes, which I NEVER did before. On some level, I know that I look good, but my thoughts get in the way so I keep losing more weight.  It's a power trip in a way? For me there's no better feeling than seeing the scale go down and seeing my body change. Like it's a better high than any drug I've ever done. I know that no amount of weight I lose will never be good enough to make me want to stop, but... that's why I'm in therapy  
If you haven't already, check out the podcast maintenance phase ♥️  
Do you like Karaoke?  
[deleted]  
OP don’t listen to this clown. “use your eating disorder to lose weight” is terrible, dangerous advice.  
I got the notification for the comment they left and thought, Yeah maybe this was a bad idea 😭  
[deleted]  
i’m p sure the fact that anorexia can lead to long term conditions like diabetes, kidney failure, weakened immune system, permanent organ damage, and death isn’t an “opinion” but if you want to be a dumbass go right ahead.  
Diabetes? um noooo  
I've had my ups and downs as well. You ll probably get fat again, thin again, fat again. I am here for one tip of advice. Find a fit personal trainer that is old. Not a young one. An old one. Not one that is obviously on roids. A normal looking one. And train with him for a month or two steal his secrets. No matter what happens, Warm up regularly Stretch regularly Do body posture exercises.  Then...  Train normally. Don't go crazy.  3 20 minute medium cardio routines per week are enough for a normal human being.  Lift normally, a few normal exercises, no need to go crazy.  The butt is supposed to be the most important muscle.. (that is what they say, I suck at squats)  Egg whites, beans, turkey, fish twice a week And you ll be fine. Dont go crazy  
Self-diagnosing Munchausen is peak Munchausen  
What does that mean? How did you get ro that conclusion?  
Not op, but its basically when you deliberately make yourself sick because it will make doctors pay attention to you  
you would probably know....  
Who's grandma's food is better? Be honest!  ; )  
My grandma’s food!!! His family’s food is great (his family makes a mean pico de gallo!), but my grandma’s Vietnamese style steak is sooo unique and nostalgic. :)  
Does he agree though? I mean I'm sure he doesn't taste the nostalgia. ;)  
He doesnt, haha. He loves his family’s food and misses it dearly when he’s away, which is fair. Their carne asada was delicious. :)  
We really want to know this one  
you are gonna give birth to the hardest-working baby this world has ever seen  
Have you been to your partner's country of origin? Has he been to yours? How was it?  
We haven’t! He admitted he’s afraid to take me to Mexico because of the crimes. On the other hand, I don’t want him to go to Vietnam because of how expensive tickets can get.  
Are you 1rst, 2nd, or 3rd generation? On average 10% of 1rst generation marry outside their group. About 30 % for 2nd and about 60% for the 3rd.  
I am 2nd gen. My parents immigrated here and I was born in USA. Thus, I grew up Asian-American, but with a strong cultural upbringing. Same goes for him. :)  
So you are both in the 30% category. Welcome to being Americans! Question: Will you raise your kids speaking Spanish or Vietnamese?  
Well we live in the US, so probably English. But I bet we would only teach them Spanish since it has the most use here!  
How’s the sex?  
Amazing! We have lots of chemistry. Also, not sure if it’s a biology thing, but his smell drives me crazy as well.  
Which of those three countries have the spiciest food in your opinion?  
Probably Mexican food! I usually handle spicy Vietnamese foods just fine but the first time I had my boyfriend’s mom’s salsa verde, I thought I was gonna turn into a dragon lol.  
It's actually been proven that spicy levels vary among the world, so be probably isn't as used to Asian spicy like you are. Probably explained it bad but it's really interesting lol  
Are interracial relationships considered controversial or are they stigmatized at all in your corner of the world?  
Both of our families are immigrants into the U.S., so yes, they are definitely stigmatized in our circle. His family was not the happiest about us being different races, and my family was initially extremely racist to him. Despite all their anger though, they see that we’re still going strong so they’ve mostly put that aside.  
In the US?  
how are you feeling? what are your symptoms? i’ve only had it once and it’s the sickest i’ve ever felt  
It was super bad yesterday, terribly high fever, chills, and achy limbs. Headache.  Those are mostly gone today, but now I'm stuck with the cough. Never coughed so hoarsely in my life.  
Zero judgement either way, but I'm curious if you've had any vaccines? I ask that strictly because I wonder what the current variants are like for people who decided not to. Hope you get back to feeling good asap!  
Oh, I'm fully vaxxed. Still hit me like a truck, this one.  Thanks for the good wishes!  
Interesting, I am also. I've had it three times, never worse than a mild cold. Its so interesting how these things affect people differently. Biology is crazy man! Have a good one!  
There’s different strains of COVID as well!  
I got the new booster in October and when I got Covid for the first time in February I was straight up dying (no lie--it was terrifying). Thank God I was able to get the anti-viral meds!  
damn, that sucks dude. i got it for the first time last september and it was just miserable. make sure ur takin care of urself! what r u doing to prevent boredom staying at home? any hobbies ur catching up on?  
I'm currently in the "feeling too terrible to do anything involving any kind of menta acuity" stage of covid to really try picking any up any hobbies. So it's mostly been mindlessly watching videos and old episodes of TV shows (Taskmaster is goated)  
Understand. Normally when I'm sick at some point throughout the day I'm like "SICK DAY! Video games for a couple hours" Naw I was out for the first 3 days the first time I had covid. Headache was massive. Could barely pay attention to TV  
Were you proud of never having it? I’ve never had it either and it makes me feel like I’m better than everyone.  
I've actually been in a competition with my friend. We were the last ones in the group to not get covid, and we were sooooooo smug about it. I was sure I would outlast him too, but alas...  
I've still never had it so I'm curious if you lost your taste and or smell? I always figured I'd try eating things I normally dislike the taste of just to say I did lol.  
Didn't get the taste or smell loss! I'm pretty happy about that. Those are my favorite senses.  
Only the first wave of covid had this symptom. Now it’s like a regular cold basically.  
My friend had Covid in March and lost her sense of taste for a few days. So it does still happen.  
I don't have a question.  Get well soon and rest as much as you can💕💕  
💖  
still living in 2019  
This might be a dumb question, but I don't know anybody personally who had Covid. Is the whole 'I can't taste food' thing real? Like I know it dulls your senses, but is eating anything like eating cardboard?  
Huh, you know, I actually don't have the taste loss thing. Lucky me, eh? Although with my luck, I'll have the brain damage to look forward to though.  
Did you die?  
🪦  
Covid isn’t real  
Neither is your intelligence  
Lol I’m sure your glad you got vaxxed and 3x boosted just to catch Covid anyway. Congrats. You got played.  
You don't know the difference between your and you're. So how did I get covid if it's not real? Choose your words carefully here. People can get injured doing mental gymnastics, especially when they don't have the equipment required to do it. Such as a brain.  
Getting “Covid” is the new flu. You realize if they were to tell everybody that illnesses were advancing but they don’t know how exactly, everyone would adhere to what the media is saying? There was no lab leak, everyone is inevitably going to catch it because it’s the air we breathe.  
I may have had it once, but idk. I didn't want to get the test because I hate having the thing go up your nose. I can't remember if I got the covid booster...I think I did. I know I got at least 2 shots though, since I had moderna. And I never get sick anyway. NEVER get a cold, or flu. Don't even bother getting a flu vaccine. But then I think about a year ago, I started feeling like shit. Cold. And one night I woke up and my ears were so congested it was making me feel like I couldn't hear. Only lasted like 3 days though. And if it was covid, I know I'll never get it again. Since I'm vaccinated and now have natural immunity, with how I never get sick, I'll be good.  
Favorite meal?  
Yaki-udon with gyoza as a side  
Sounds super yummy! I hope you get some soon!  
Thank you lol  
Do you know much about octopuses?  
Yes I do! I don’t know how to disseminate this information in general so ask me something and I will answer :)  
How well do you think you could train an octopus to play connect 4?  
What's the best thing you've learnt so far? Do you have beef with the land biologists/ zoologists?  
 Whale sharks, my favorite animal, are known as ca ong in Vietnamese, which means "sir fish". I will be willing to dispense more facts if you wish. Kind of, lol. I have a beef with people who prefer land animals cause I think aquatic ones are better.   
Hit me with more facts  
 Octopuses have been known to eat small sharks, such as dogfish There is a type of stingray called the electric ray, which can discharge huge amounts of lethal electricity to discourage predators from eating it. The bubbles popped by pistol shrimps when they use their claws have been known to interfere with submarine radar   
What are the benefits of being a marine biologist  
Wdym? For me it's just chasing my passion.  
it's a meme  
Found my new favorite meme  
what is an aquarist? for some reason it sounds like it’s just someone who’s really into water.  
Basically an aquatic zookeeper. People who take care of the animals at aquariums.  
do u have any remaining vision or r u totally blind? what's ur favorite thing to snack on?  
I have light perception but no depth perception. So I can't see shapes/outlines. My favorite thing to snack on are chocolate chip cookies. They're the best  
does that mean u can also see colors? good choice, i love a good warm chocolate chip cookie  
Yes, I can see colors, though it is a bit difficult to differentiate between them sometimes. The older I get the harder it gets.  
I know it is possible nowadays, but how you play games and what do you play on most times then not?  
Mainly computer, as you can find a whole load of games specifically for blind/visually impaired people. They're called audio games. Go figure.  
What kind of person are you attracted to?  
Oh, I'd say women. I do have hands in loo of eyes, so I know perfectly well what a woman is, physically speaking and that is what I very much enjoy.  
Do you network or do other things with other blind people?  
I've got a handful of blind friends, if that counts.  
dumb question and probably been asked a lot, but how do you type?  
My phone has a screen reader on it, called Voiceover. It basically makes your phone accessible, and you can do everything via gestures on the screen with your fingers. I also use a keyboard, which is much faster for typing purposes.  
dumb question and probably been asked a lot, but how do you type? or read comments?  
What kind of blindness?  
My eye condition is called retinopathy of prematurity. Basically just means that my retina’s are not fully developed. I was born at only 24 weeks.  
Can you see any https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene? Like by rubbing your eyes?  Can you visualize things with your mind's eye like a geometric shape?  
While I can see Phosphene, I can't visualize shapes because I only have light perception and can't differentiate shapes from one another. I can see colors, though, but that's steadily leaving me.  
what’s your favorite movie  
Avengers: Infinity War.  
So do you ‘watch’ movies by listening to the sounds? What makes you like that movie better than other ones?  
Most movies nowadays have audio description. Basically what that is is somebody describing what is happening in the movie.  
what’s your favorite movie  
do you have any idea what color is?  
Yes, I can see color, though not nearly as well as I used to. Certain colors are almost impossible to tell apart for me now, such as red/orange and blue/purple  
what are your favorite noise environments? (e.g. sitting in a coffee shop, riding in a car with music, riding on a train, walking on a busy street)  
I like listening to the general chatter of restaurants and coffee shops. I also like the interior of trains, walking on the boardwalk at the beach, and listening to the ocean. I also like nighttime in the country. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a sound environment that I didn’t enjoy.  
I think I would enjoy providing image descriptions for people who are blind. Any idea where I could start?  And/or are there any images you’d like me to describe for you?  
I believe there is a subreddit for that. I forget what it’s called.  
I have a blind classmate in a class of mine and I’ve always wonder if it’s hard to comprehend and follow mathematical processes when you can’t see the symbols. I would also like to know what is your definition of color?  
I'm bad at math in general, especially geometry and trigonometry. I can see colors, but I can't describe them as anything but that color. I'm steadily losing that ability though.  
do you have visuals while dreaming?  
In a way, yes. Mostly just flashes of light and color. No shapes though. Sometimes I’ll see the sky or the interior of my room, but nothing is in detail.  
When you say you see the sky, is it just a notion of blue without shape? And what is the interior of a room without detail, it is just the color and idea of your room? Are these dream seeings of the sky and your room visually about the same as when you are awake?  
What condition do you have?  
My eye condition is called retinopathy of prematurity. Basically just means that my retina’s are not fully developed. I was born at only 24 weeks.  
do you dream ?  
Yes, I do, in fact, dream. Usually they are just auditory, though. Sometimes I’ll have flashes of color, but that’s it.  
i really hope you are happy mate, if not, i wish you all the happiness in this world.  
Thank you :-)  
How do you think you would you react if you suddenly developed eyesight?  
I'd be very happy... and then I'd play Skyrim, since I'd be able to.  
Did you do your research on spiders and snakes in your new home city and how to best burn it down? Also, why made you choose the particular city you did?  
I didn't, no, but bug spray, lots and lots of bug spray, that always works a trick, except for snakes, I'd just run the other way and look like a complete idiot doing it haha. And I chose the city I moved to because of the beaches and lifestyle, it's by the beach so I can wake up each day, see the beach and go for a walk along it if I like. That and there are a few cute surfer men up here too as it turns out haha.  
For next level new start, Australia, NZ and Canada have an agreement for young people to travel to the other's country for work for a year or something like that. We have so many Aussies here in Vancouver and Whistler, BC! They're all attractive mountain bikers and snow sports people 😉 Any plans for employment in your new home city?  
I'd not really thought about moving overseas, just moving cities here in Australia was bad enough, but I guess I'll keep that in mind for the future as I don't have many ties here right now. And for employment, I've got some bar work at the moment which pays the bills, but I might look to get something else once I'm a bit more settled in.  
Awesome. Good luck, Lucy! 🤙🏼  
Why did you move?  
So like there are a few reasons, but it mostly all comes down to me wanting a change, to almost start afresh a little. I've lived in the one city all my life and I just got hooked on the idea of seeing somewhere new, meeting new people, having new opportunities, and hopefully making the most of it.  
How far away is the old city?  
It's roughly 1,700kms, which sounds like a lot, and it definitely is, but it's just a few hours by plane, so not the other side of the world, but if I do want to go home at any stage, I sort of need to plan it with flights and the like.  
Most interesting thing to happen since moving? other than this ama (haha)  
Well this AMA is pretty interesting, thanks for asking questions, but away from this, when I was looking for somewhere to live it was pretty wild, just how expensive even some tiny places are, and some weird people in share houses. But then I got really lucky as a friend's work colleague has a place up here where the tenant moved out and they've let me stay which is amazing.  
Sounds perfect  
What are you hobbies?  
I've got a few, so in the summer I love being outdoors, whether it's walking in the wilderness or visiting the beach, and in the winter, I've done a little skiing but I'm rubbish at it. I also love spending time with friends, I used to do some sports but not so much anymore, that's probably been replaced by shopping haha.  
I'm guessing you travel in your country as a hobby. How do you afford it?  
I travel for pleasure, like holidays and stuff, yeah, but not frequently at all, and I obviously have to save before I do. It's just by putting away money from work and having that goal to go away somewhere, plus looking for offers and such to make it cheaper where possible.  
One of my uncles used to do the same with his family. He used to go a lot during summer vacations and travelled all around the country. What are some of your favorite places you've visited so far?  
I've not done a heap of travelling, but I'd like to do more though. I've visited parts of Asia before, I have family there, and I really enjoyed that, and I've also been to New Zealand which was pretty cool. I really want to get to Europe though.  
That's cool! What countries have you visited in Asia? I'm from Asia too. I've never been outside my own country but I heard Europe is really good. They have a lot of beautiful places.  
Did you move from Perth to Alice Springs?  
I didn't, think more moving from the south and going further north, to hopefully find some warmer weather and I guess just see how things go.  
Ah, well I hope you find good things and happiness.  
Do you know Nanette?
