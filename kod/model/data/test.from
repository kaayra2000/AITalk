Which place in the world sounds the most exotic or distant to the Vietnamese?  For example in my country the stereotype goes something like " It's as far as China" or "Timbuktu", is there something like that for you?

Do Vietnamese people hate Americans because of the war?  
No, of course they hated the war, but now they're very liked Americans, especially the Whites.

What do you think about the Korean war? Do you think that the US/UN should not have intervened, and let South Korea fall? What do you think about French involvement in Vietnam, compared to American involvement? Also, you referred to Saigon. Does anybody actually call it Ho Chi Minh City? Why do you think that the name “Saigon“ persist despite the official renaming?  
 I don't care and don't know about the Korean war. Vietnam is basically the twins with France, everything from appearances, behaves, feminism and patriarchy is deeply influenced by their. I like the term "Saigon" because, first, I was born in the decade that term was preferred over "Ho Chi Minh City". Also, I don't like Ho Chi Minh nor the government.

Have you had any situations where a foreign diplomat did something shady and pulled the DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY card?  
We've had a few of their dependents try to pull the diplomatic immunity card but never for something serious. Most of the time it's to try and get out of traffic tickets or parking violations. Edit to add: while I've been here Unfortunately for them, they're not their parents and (typically) have much more limited immunity and if any of them pulled anything seriously criminal it's very likely we would either label them persona non grata or request  their home country to waive immunity.  
Which countries are the worst for that?  
It's always Spain and Austria. Korea has had a few but the Korean government was pretty easy to work with to resolve the dispute out of the courts.

My girlfriend just finished her master's degree in an international relations-related major and is working for a State Dept. contractor, what's the best way to get a role in the State Department itself?  
Ho early? If she's at a contractor and wants to transfer, depending on how long she's been at her current position, I'd apply. Especially if she has contacts in the State Department who can act as references.  
She's been at her current role for about seven months, and this is her first state department-adjacent role. She knows she's early on in her career and it can be extremely competitive to get in so she's not expecting anything soon, but I'm really proud of her for the work she's put in so far and I really want to see her make it. Any advice or encouragement for her would be much appreciated. I'll definitely pass on what you told me. Thank you so much.

I'm sure you have experienced your share of office or inter-agency drama. What are the top three instances of this that you can tell us?  
 Dealing with DHS, literally anytime we have to deal with DHS.  Had an ICE office literally make us send almost two years of paper files, which were housed in DHS HQ to prove a dignitaries status. Which required us to have an agent physically go to DHS HQ to fill out paperwork to request them transfer an itemised list to us so that we could send them to ICE (and this is not the worst the red tape gets).  Firearms certs.  You always have that one person who complains about having to recert which then delays everyone as you have to pick up their workload while they retrain to meet cert. Just maintain your cert, it's not that difficult! I do enough as is in my position, I don't want to be doing your job.  Translators taking forever.  You're literally professional translators who hold near native fluency from DLI, why is it taking you a week to translate a simple car rental request from a hosting nation?

Is this secretly an ad to get people to check out careers with State Dept?  
Trust me, you get paid pennies for the work you do compared to private sector admin jobs. It's only really a good job for people who are fine with giving a little bit on salary in order to get predictability and security. I have a job for life as long as I don't get fired. The only time that wasn't a guarantee was when we got a memo after a certain November saying 80% of us would be fired in order to "clean house" None of us were fired.... except for Michael but he deserved it. Edit: I should add I make about $123k/yr, private sector I could likely get double that if I had similar connections to get in like I did with the state department (my parents worked as foreign dignitaries to Italy and later as Economic Analysts for the CIA).  
Oh I get it. That predictability and security are enticing to me and I’ve taken a look in the government sector a few times. But I don’t wanna live in the DC-area.  
I live in Alexandria and commute to DC. Plenty of cities and towns within commuting distance in Virginia and Maryland.

Any tips for someone wanting to work a job like that?  I always try to apply to jobs via USAJOBS site but man, I'm just never selected. I'll take any state department job at this point. Or any decent gov job 😅  
You really need an in. Networking is the name of the game. I'd say try to get a job with a contractor and make as many connections in the State Department as possible. Then apply with them as a professional reference. In-house references are an easy way to get an interview. If you get the interview, depending on which sector or department, expect to be asked questions related to your prior clearances, history of drug use, and any criminal or delinquent behaviour you've ever partaken in going back to childhood. They're not looking for you to be spotless, but honest.

No questions, just a bit jealous of your boring job. I have a role that is a mix of HR, office administrator, and sysadmin that makes me wanna tear my hair out at least twice a day. Pay is great and my colleagues are great, but the vendors and our technicians really go out of their way to kill my vibe Monday thru Friday lol. I work so much overtime 😩  
You have vendor and tech issues. I have to coordinate allowing our vendors and technicians in the building because somebody (not naming names cough Evanna cough) forgot to process their clearance applications. It's not actually that bad.... when people do their jobs. It's when they forget to do their jobs that you start to have issues.... or when your boss is completely incompetent and changes your work policies almost daily to spite foreign leaders who called him names (again, not naming names but you can probably guess)

If the dog shows genuine aggressive behaviour that I can’t control with a muzzle/calming hammock, I will stop the groom and advise they try somewhere with multiple groomers, or vet sedation if the dog is very bad. I have managed to calm aggressive dogs though if the owners are compliant with regular visits and desensitisation at home.

I am a hot air balloon pilot AMA
How safe is it? Like actually. I want to give it a go but I'm scared 😅  
I wont give you the standard sales pitch that it is safer than driving a car, but among air sports, it is pretty safe. It definely "feels" very safe I havent had a passenger who was so scared that we had to land, people are sometimes anxious at first but enjoy it after a couple of minutes on the other hand, from personal experience, I have tried paragliding and I was horrified all the way through. I think am actually too spoiled from the comfort and safety of my balloon. Go for it.  
I am a hot air balloon pilot AMA
What does a new hot air balloon cost?  
Depends on the size but the most common ones are for 5-6 people and cost about 50k USD. Most pilots are flying passengers so we get some or ideally most of that cost back during the lifetime of our balloon the cost can be further reduced by having advertisements on the balloons envelope. You can get a new smaller one for less but it is not really economical for passenger flights so it ends up being the costly option. You can also buy a used balloon which is common or possibly even make the balloon yourself although it is rare.  
I am a hot air balloon pilot AMA
What do you eat while you're flying? What do the controls look like for the burner?  
The flight usually last about an hour so I dont have to worry about getting hungry. We do however offer small snacks to passangers before the flight while we inflate the balloon, usually sweet buns and also cofee or tea. After the flight we serve champagne. You can think of burner as sort of like a regular grill. The burner unit consist of a fuel source, a pilot light, and a burner valve. The burner burns propane but unlike the on a grill it burns liquid propane not vapors. We can control the intensity of the flame and adjust its direction. There are gauges that monitor fuel and pressure.  
I am a hot air balloon pilot AMA
How do you pilot a hot air balloon?  Isn't it just up and down, then you're at the mercy of the wind?  
Yeah basically, but we do have some level of horizontal control by knowing where the wind is blowing. We have meteo forecast and we release a small party balloon just before the flight to check the winds that is usually enough for passenger flights.  There are balloon competitions where pilots chose a target and fly towards it from several kilometers away and sometimes come within just meters. They use the above mentioned meteo forcasts and helium balloons and to check for winds below them they drop something very light like shaving cream, popcorn etc. There are even live meteo data nowadays. But even with all of this having simple luck still plays the largest part.  
That's actually fascinating, thank you. As a balloon enthusiast, how do you feel about inflation?

Don't ask me how she could land a plane though. I guess as long as she didn't have to reverse she was okay. As a bonus my dad was a mechanic so there used to be this constant cycle of her backing up into something and him having to fix it.

Is the cruise ship industry doing anything to be less heinous to the environment? I'd love to go on a cruise, but the polluting (well, and the tales of norovirus) are scaring me off.  
 Is the cruise ship industry doing anything to be less heinous to the environment?  To be honest, I doubt it. I don't think most of the people running these businesses high up have a lot of ethics. I read this story a while back, so I'm certainly aware of the issues though: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/08/massive-tax-exempt-cruise-ships-damage-environment. Personally, I would never have considered going on a cruise if it wasn't for my wife's job. I much prefer independent travel. And actually, as you mention it the norovirus tales are very real. If one person has it, you ca be pretty sure most of the ship is coming down with it. My wife's been working on cruise ships for two years now and has already had 3 pretty awful bouts of stomach flu.  
Eef! I'll continue to stay away, then. Here's hoping your wife stays safe and breaks out soon.

Do you have kids? Are you knit concerned that she’s hanging out with hunky male dancers 90% of the time? What do you do for a living?  
I was once a escort AMA
Favorite travel destination?  
Gosh I don't know. I really enjoyed America when I was there tbh.  
Oh America is fun! What part did you go to?  
Maryland Washington state. Also visited Washington as well.  
I was once a escort AMA
Why did you start? Why did you stop?  
Started because I enjoyed sex and someone I was sleeping with said why don't you eacort and make money. So I tried it and then of course the money was a factor. Stopped cause I guess I just got burnt out by it and wasn't enjoying it anymore  
What did you learn about men while you were doing it?  
Hmmm gosh I don't know.... that men will pay for anything lol honestly I was gonna say that men are desperate but I met some lovely guys including men who were on leave in army etc and just didn't want to have to look for sex for ages.

how would you have reacted if a man paid the full price but wanted to just cuddle?  
I'd have obliged and gave him the best possible cuddle ever lol. Just to note I was also until quite recently a professional cuddler and got paid to give cuddles lol. Haha.  
Do you think escorts in general are okay with it? How common is it for escort clients to want just to cuddle? Professional cuddler sounds awesome! How might a cuddling session look like?  
I went from being morbidly obese to anorexic in 3 years (18f)
What happened?  
I was tired of hating myself and feeling like I was invisible. I had a hard time making friends in high school, I would try to talk to people but I mean I was both overweight and too depressed to put effort into my appearance otherwise so I pretty much just looked like a slob all the time. Nobody wanted to be friends with me back then and I can't blame them though I like to believe I would never treat anyone else the way I was treated because of their appearance  
That sucks, I'm sorry about that :s How are you doing nowadays?

My overweight mother thought that if a girl has weight issues, it means that they had issues with their mothers. Do you think that there is some truth to this? Also, have you ever talked with a therapist?  
I went from being morbidly obese to anorexic in 3 years (18f)
Do you have a support system in place? Recovery fucking sucks, but you deserve to feel good in your body.  
I went from being morbidly obese to anorexic in 3 years (18f)
Are you underweight currently?  
No </3 I'm really short so for the "underweight" bmi I would have to be 90 pounds or something which I am not and never will be tbh  
So you're not actually anorexic then 🙄

Since you’ve experienced both sides of the spectrum, which one is more preferable?

OP don’t listen to this clown. “use your eating disorder to lose weight” is terrible, dangerous advice.

i’m p sure the fact that anorexia can lead to long term conditions like diabetes, kidney failure, weakened immune system, permanent organ damage, and death isn’t an “opinion” but if you want to be a dumbass go right ahead.

I (22F) have been in an interracial relationship for 2 years. I am Vietnamese-Chinese, he (21M) is Mexican. AMA! :)
Who's grandma's food is better? Be honest!  ; )  
My grandma’s food!!! His family’s food is great (his family makes a mean pico de gallo!), but my grandma’s Vietnamese style steak is sooo unique and nostalgic. :)  
Does he agree though? I mean I'm sure he doesn't taste the nostalgia. ;)

Have you been to your partner's country of origin? Has he been to yours? How was it?  
I (22F) have been in an interracial relationship for 2 years. I am Vietnamese-Chinese, he (21M) is Mexican. AMA! :)
Are you 1rst, 2nd, or 3rd generation? On average 10% of 1rst generation marry outside their group. About 30 % for 2nd and about 60% for the 3rd.  
I am 2nd gen. My parents immigrated here and I was born in USA. Thus, I grew up Asian-American, but with a strong cultural upbringing. Same goes for him. :)  
So you are both in the 30% category. Welcome to being Americans! Question: Will you raise your kids speaking Spanish or Vietnamese?

Which of those three countries have the spiciest food in your opinion?  
Probably Mexican food! I usually handle spicy Vietnamese foods just fine but the first time I had my boyfriend’s mom’s salsa verde, I thought I was gonna turn into a dragon lol.

Are interracial relationships considered controversial or are they stigmatized at all in your corner of the world?  
Both of our families are immigrants into the U.S., so yes, they are definitely stigmatized in our circle. His family was not the happiest about us being different races, and my family was initially extremely racist to him. Despite all their anger though, they see that we’re still going strong so they’ve mostly put that aside.  
I just got covid for the first time, AMA
how are you feeling? what are your symptoms? i’ve only had it once and it’s the sickest i’ve ever felt  
I just got covid for the first time, AMA
Zero judgement either way, but I'm curious if you've had any vaccines? I ask that strictly because I wonder what the current variants are like for people who decided not to. Hope you get back to feeling good asap!  
Oh, I'm fully vaxxed. Still hit me like a truck, this one.  Thanks for the good wishes!  
Interesting, I am also. I've had it three times, never worse than a mild cold. Its so interesting how these things affect people differently. Biology is crazy man! Have a good one!

damn, that sucks dude. i got it for the first time last september and it was just miserable. make sure ur takin care of urself! what r u doing to prevent boredom staying at home? any hobbies ur catching up on?  
I'm currently in the "feeling too terrible to do anything involving any kind of menta acuity" stage of covid to really try picking any up any hobbies. So it's mostly been mindlessly watching videos and old episodes of TV shows (Taskmaster is goated)  
I just got covid for the first time, AMA
Were you proud of never having it? I’ve never had it either and it makes me feel like I’m better than everyone.  
I just got covid for the first time, AMA
I've still never had it so I'm curious if you lost your taste and or smell? I always figured I'd try eating things I normally dislike the taste of just to say I did lol.

Only the first wave of covid had this symptom. Now it’s like a regular cold basically.

I don't have a question.  Get well soon and rest as much as you can💕💕

This might be a dumb question, but I don't know anybody personally who had Covid. Is the whole 'I can't taste food' thing real? Like I know it dulls your senses, but is eating anything like eating cardboard?  
I just got covid for the first time, AMA
Did you die?  
I just got covid for the first time, AMA
Covid isn’t real  
Neither is your intelligence  
Lol I’m sure your glad you got vaxxed and 3x boosted just to catch Covid anyway. Congrats. You got played.

What's the best thing you've learnt so far? Do you have beef with the land biologists/ zoologists?  
 Whale sharks, my favorite animal, are known as ca ong in Vietnamese, which means "sir fish". I will be willing to dispense more facts if you wish. Kind of, lol. I have a beef with people who prefer land animals cause I think aquatic ones are better.   
Hit me with more facts

What kind of blindness?  
My eye condition is called retinopathy of prematurity. Basically just means that my retina’s are not fully developed. I was born at only 24 weeks.  
Can you see any https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene? Like by rubbing your eyes?  Can you visualize things with your mind's eye like a geometric shape?

I have a blind classmate in a class of mine and I’ve always wonder if it’s hard to comprehend and follow mathematical processes when you can’t see the symbols. I would also like to know what is your definition of color?

do you have visuals while dreaming?

How do you think you would you react if you suddenly developed eyesight?  
I [F24] have just moved cities on my own to start a new adventure. AMA.
Did you do your research on spiders and snakes in your new home city and how to best burn it down? Also, why made you choose the particular city you did?  
I didn't, no, but bug spray, lots and lots of bug spray, that always works a trick, except for snakes, I'd just run the other way and look like a complete idiot doing it haha. And I chose the city I moved to because of the beaches and lifestyle, it's by the beach so I can wake up each day, see the beach and go for a walk along it if I like. That and there are a few cute surfer men up here too as it turns out haha.  
For next level new start, Australia, NZ and Canada have an agreement for young people to travel to the other's country for work for a year or something like that. We have so many Aussies here in Vancouver and Whistler, BC! They're all attractive mountain bikers and snow sports people 😉 Any plans for employment in your new home city?  
I'd not really thought about moving overseas, just moving cities here in Australia was bad enough, but I guess I'll keep that in mind for the future as I don't have many ties here right now. And for employment, I've got some bar work at the moment which pays the bills, but I might look to get something else once I'm a bit more settled in.  
I [F24] have just moved cities on my own to start a new adventure. AMA.
Why did you move?  
So like there are a few reasons, but it mostly all comes down to me wanting a change, to almost start afresh a little. I've lived in the one city all my life and I just got hooked on the idea of seeing somewhere new, meeting new people, having new opportunities, and hopefully making the most of it.  
How far away is the old city?  
I [F24] have just moved cities on my own to start a new adventure. AMA.
Most interesting thing to happen since moving? other than this ama (haha)  
Well this AMA is pretty interesting, thanks for asking questions, but away from this, when I was looking for somewhere to live it was pretty wild, just how expensive even some tiny places are, and some weird people in share houses. But then I got really lucky as a friend's work colleague has a place up here where the tenant moved out and they've let me stay which is amazing.

What are you hobbies?  
I [F24] have just moved cities on my own to start a new adventure. AMA.
I'm guessing you travel in your country as a hobby. How do you afford it?  
I travel for pleasure, like holidays and stuff, yeah, but not frequently at all, and I obviously have to save before I do. It's just by putting away money from work and having that goal to go away somewhere, plus looking for offers and such to make it cheaper where possible.  
One of my uncles used to do the same with his family. He used to go a lot during summer vacations and travelled all around the country. What are some of your favorite places you've visited so far?  
I've not done a heap of travelling, but I'd like to do more though. I've visited parts of Asia before, I have family there, and I really enjoyed that, and I've also been to New Zealand which was pretty cool. I really want to get to Europe though.

Did you move from Perth to Alice Springs?  
I didn't, think more moving from the south and going further north, to hopefully find some warmer weather and I guess just see how things go.
