IAmA Wild Sketch Appeared. The r/IAmA mods decided remove my AMA (even though they willingly allowed ShittyWatercolour to do the same exact thing). So lets take it to r/CasualIAmA! Ask me anything.
I remember Shittywatercolour got a job with the BBC out of his work on reddit. Have you had any opportunities open up as a result of what you've done on reddit?  
Not actually full-time job opportunities.  At least so far.  I like what I'm doing professionally outside of artwork.  But anything can change as long as something has even better pay and security in the future.  If I can make additional money off to the side with artwork- I say why not?   It's like having a second job that you actually like doing instead of toughing it out for only the paycheck.  
Do you think that he turned it in to a job is why his AMA stayed up?  
not going to pretend to understand the workings of moderators there, but I guess it's based on stuff done outside of reddit.  Also just to clarify, I'm a student. I work with the BBC on some things, but primarily I'm still a student.  
Do you think that he turned it in to a job is why his AMA stayed up?  
At a minimum, the fact that shittywatercolor did an AMA would mean that AWildSketchAppeared's AMA would probably no longer be considered "unique."

Whatever happened to SureIllDrawThat? He was the first drawing celebrity on Reddit, before Shittywatercolour.

How do you feel about ShittyWatercolour? Is he your mortal enemy or are you guys friends?  
yeah we are really good friends on facebook actually. =) He tends to drop off the face of the earth most of the time though.

What is your all time favorite sketch? Are there any sketches you later regretted doing?   
Favorite? Snorlax/Sloth blazed out in front of a celtic cross. Stuff I regretted?  The infamous rape sketch I suppose.  Even though I've drawn some that's equally fucked-up and rapey. Only difference is those "victims" were all male and they are explicit as fuck, but the one that caught extra attention (in large part due to the SRSers) happened to be an obscured female in a car.  
Link? I will also accept a reenactment sketch of the sketch.

Dude, I feel for you. They removed my AMAs after both of my book releases. Something something about being "Internet famous." The AMA mods are the worst.  
That is funny, given that IAmA started as a place where anyone with a cool story (of something they do/did) could talk about. I remember the girl that was a Disney character in Disney World... they were not famous at all. Now it is just a blatant advertisement site for people who want to promote whatever movie, music, political campaign and/or any other shit they've got.  
Some of those early AMAs were great. I remember one by a guy who had done basically every psychedelic drug known to man and meticulously cataloged his experiences. Fascinating. Much more interesting than asking some actor, "What was it like working with such-and-such person?" EDIT: A lot of people are asking for a link to that AMA. I searched, but either OP deleted it or my Google-fu is not what it used to be. If anyone else wants to try, I can tell you it was probably within the first six months of the creation of /r/IamA. EDIT 2: Thanks to /u/NO_TOUCHING__lol, here is the AMA I mentioned.

Wonder which has a lower approval rating, the US Congress or the IAmA mods.  
What are you going to do, right? I'm a huge fan of your stuff by the way.  
Who knows. But yeah, that's total bullshit.  "A guy who is famous on Reddit for painting watercolors? Right this way! A guy who is famous on Reddit for sketching stuff? DENIED!" "An internet-famous author making an AMA to promote a book?  Nope, can't let 'im do that.  Get a Hollywood actor to do an AMA for promoting his/her newest movie?  Instant approval!"

what a bunch of bullshit, they're so proud when a reddit writing prompt get's turned into a movie, so proud that Wired writes an article about it, so happy to bend over backwards for publicists trying to promote some shitty movie.  But snub people who haven't been a part of a hollywood production?  They gonna delete Pewdiepies AMA?  dunno if he ever tried but fuck him, he's only 'internet famous', doesn't matter if more people have seen his videos than have seen every superbowl ever* , oh by the way check out all those great commercials here on reddit!  Oh you want to share a comic you drew?  Sorry that would be self promotion and we can't have that *statistics are not researched and completely made up  (and edit: just checked, 'internet famous' Pewdiepie has done at least 3 official AMAs, for doing let's plays on youtube) edit3: redactions redacted

You should really do an AMA here at some point. You're probably my favorite guy on the internet (I still deeply treasure the handwritten letter), and it sucks that the /r/IAmA moderators removed such a golden opportunity.

Why did you start doing this? What was the first thread you posted a sketch in?  
2 and a half years ago, so Aug/Sep 2011.  First sketch was a chick who works at Home Depot with a Hollywood celebrity (the dude who looks like a combo of Bradley Cooper and Chris Pratt - I totally forgot his name!! I've spent the last 15 minutes just trying to find that sketch and who his name is!). Edit: It was Paul Rudd!!  
Wasn't 2 and a half years ago 2012?  
Considering that 2015 is still fresh.  I know for certain I been drawing on reddit a year before the 2012 elections. *edit: Oops, it was actually Aug of 2012. -_-  Time really flies too damn fast and the new year's really been fucking with my head.

She wasn't giving any information but she was just saying things like "thanks!"  Now I look at her comment history and her most recent post that's listed there was 2 days ago. Did someone delete her comments from the last day or two?

as much as I'd like to see this happen, chances are it won't. Last time we had a former reddit employee come in on an AMA, Yishan Wong himself (former CEO) showed up in the thread and made a huge ass of himself by calling out every single infraction and complaint registered about that employee out in the open. I doubt Victoria would want to risk that happening to her as well (and possibly ruining any chance at a different career in the same field she was in), seeing as her personal identity was closely associated to her activity on reddit and as an employee.

true, he was badmouthing the company, and on it's own website no less. but at the same time it's insanely unprofessional to divulge that kind of information, especially in the way he did. If Yishan had just come out with a cool and level headed response, it would have been a different story. but with the response he gave, he was playing on the same level as the person doing the AMA.

Wong didn't make an ass out of himself; he fought fire with fire.  And he certainly did so in a surprisingly professional manner.  There was no tit-for-tat bullshit going on; he simply addressed all the bullshit, in one well-structured post. Just because the truth isn't always pretty, doesn't mean it should be sugarcoated.  Sometimes, blunt and to the point is the best way to go. Society would be so much better if everything was handled this way.  
that was the complete opposite of professional. it was a borderline "fite me irl m8" post. I agree sometimes it's better to be blunt and objective. and that kind of situation was definitely one of them, but the response was in no way professional, especially for the fucking Chief Executive Officer of a company.

She is letting a bit of information out, like this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3bwev7/i_had_the_pleasure_of_meeting_uchooter_in_person/csqanbb I would love to see her do a full Q & A, but on an actual news site.  The story of her being canned is going to hit blogs and the general internet in a matter of hours, so she can easily tell her side of the story - the admins are going to be hard pressed to present their side in any legit fashion, since if there was a good reason, they would have acted differently. Bad decisions deserve bad PR in return, I hope to see some sites get to work on this

Did you bring the girls up from the club? How much did they cost for the night? What else did you do in TJ? I think if I ever decide to pull a Leaving Las Vegas, this would be my style.  
Yeah, I brought the girls up.  The club offered to send them in for me, but I quickly realized that meant they would send up only the girls who didn't drum up much business, so I started going downstairs and picking and choosing.   Roughly $60 an hour or $300 a night.  I didn't pay for the night.  I'd get a few girls, have some fun, then pass out for a few hours, get some food and water in me, and then pay for a few more girls.  Kept  cycling like that for about 5-6 days.

 Roughly $60 an hour or $300 a night.  Do you worry about human trafficking or is that a normal price for Mexico? Because that seems cheap as fuck.  
I was in a bad, bad state.  Really fucking BAD.  I don't think any of the girls were trafficked.  $60 was just the going rate.  From what I understand from research after the fact, they probably were not trafficked.   It's my shame that I might have participated in something horrific like that, but I think it was all legit.  Or as legit as it can be.   The women were definitely legal age.  Brothels are legal, or there's a legal loophole or something, and police were around keeping the order.  It wasn't like some back alley freakshow.

 Somewhere in the midst of my coke-fueled orgy I decide life wasn't so bad after all.  Best story ever. Why did you want to die?  
Abusive childhood lead to severe depression and bitterness.  I pushed everyone away. Just hated life, didn't want to face my problems.    
That's how I am! I take drugs too. I also make good money. Both help, but we will always be fucked up. Look into the drug "2c-b". You will like that one, and it's much easier on your system than fucking coke.   
I've met accountants, businessmen, government drones, etc., in their 40s with families and six figure incomes who get fucking THRASHED.  It's weird.  Most people think of drug users as being creepy people living in the bad part of town, but those people don't have any money!  They're smoking pot at best.   It's the guys with money that are the true drug fiends!  They can afford to chase the dragon. I'll check Erowid on 2c-b.  I've heard of it before.  Mostly I stick to LSD and mescaline these days.  Psychological mindfuck, but not so hard on the body.

I don't want to be condescending here, as I'm sure many of you are aware of this, but 2cb is crazily potent! we're talking milligram-tens of milligram quantities to get a decent high (as opposed to hundereds of milligrams for substances like MDMA). you can easily overdose if you don't have a clue as to what you're taking. just be fucking careful and if you have to take it, get a good balance to weigh it out! Also, I've heard it's one of the most painful things that you can snort...

Whats the nastiest thing you did with one of the prostitutes?  
One girl was down for some lezzy shit but the other wasn't, so I offered her an extra $50 if she'd let the first girl go down on her while I fucked lezzy from behind.  Something about a straight girl getting eaten out by another girl just  drives me up the fucking wall.   I don't know if that's the kind of nasty you're thinking of, but that was definitely my favorite moment.    
Nah thats cool, pretty tame though. . . .figured someone woulda got shat on.  Thanks for the answer

Ha! Many years ago was in a similar place, made similar choices with similar results. Today I still have depression but the bottom line is I'm curious as to what the fuck happens next. Life is an adventure. That doesn't mean "fun," that means "adventure." This world is full of surprises. I first considered suicide when I was ten, 45 years ago. Since then I have seen things... a naked girl, machine guns in anger pointed at me, True Love, betrayal, real love. I have French kissed a French girl on a boat sailing across the Adriatic. I have crossed the finish line in regattas ahead of America's Cup skippers. I have sat alone on a tall mountaintop and watched storm clouds boil beneath me. I have known women who were and are truly special to me. I am old but last week I raced a truly fast motorcycle on a racetrack faster than I have ever gone. And I have held a pistol to my head many times. Any day I can choose to leave. many times, countless times, I have considered it. Tonight, sitting here, right now I have a lovely Colt Defender Lightweight I bought in 2011 (100th anniversary of 1911). I just this moment, between sentences, thought of adding that final punctuation to my life. the thing is, I can't wait to see what comes next. I'm only 55, dammit. In 20 or 30 or 40 years my body will betray me and quit. GODDAMIT! Only 40 more years? I really want to see the ghosts of the Ayn Rand worshipers talk their way out of the coming droughts and polar thaws. I want to see the Canadians gasp as the Columbus Blue Jackets win the Stanley Cup from the Bogata Bombers. Depression sucks. Sure. Meds help. Sure. The bottom line, as in Hamlet, is choosing whether you choose to participate. "To be or not to be..." WTF do you think he was talking about? Life isn't pretty, but dude, it has flavor. edit- typo

I've always dreamed of doing something like this if I ever caught cancer. Round up some dough and go to Brazil to do drugs and fuck women before dying.  Great story, I'm glad you stayed with us a while longer.   
Glad I stuck around, too. I firmly believe every man should have a threesome once before he dies, and since threesomes probably won't happen naturally, I say put aside a happy-time fund.  20 a month until you have $700.  that's about the going rate for two women in the US.    
how far would 500 get me in Tijuana?  
One woman for a night or several women for an hour each.  Some good meals.   Loads of booze.    Bottle or two of Valium or Percocet.

If you don't mind me asking, how'd you get into the field?  
When I was younger I looked at being able to program as a super power,  so as I kid I thought to myself that if I can type the correct symbols and numbers in a logical order I can make a computer do something that no human could ever do,  to me that was a super power. I did not plan on it being anything,  so I left Chicago and moved to Dallas,  got a job at Intel Security which at the time was McAfee.  I learned Linux when I was younger due to it being easier to compile and execute Perl and Python scripts etc.   McAfee SIEM takes off as a project,  I learn a ton about all sort of network devices cause SIEM touches all of them. That experience on top of my programming and Linux background gives me a birds eye perspective on how everything works.  My friend Brandon,  talks to one of his contacts who is a pen tester.  The guy gives me a job,  now I travel and do drugs and scream myself to sleep 2 nights a week.   TLDR: The grass is sometimes greener on the other side cause it rains more over here

Did you take a lot of US currency or did you use an ATM in Mexico? Well, you know, not that much. Did you leave a will?  
I took cash, bu I did use plastic to pay for hotel rooms.  I never tried the ATM  
What is happening now? It's dawn in Mexico.  
Right now most of the ladies at the Hong Kong Club are stumbling home.  Men are taking massive diarrhea dumps because they spent all night drinking cocktails and forgot the ice in their drinks includes Montezuma's Revenge.  (I fucked up that way once).  Others are freaking the FUCK out because they took way too much coke and they think they're going to have a heart attack.  They'll fall asleep in a couple hours and start all over again.

Honestly this is how I would like to go out, Suicide at this point feels like my only hope, However, I don't have 3000 pounds to finish myself off, though it would involve more alcohol and less drugs.

any lasting side effects? how much money did this whole ordeal end up costing you?  for some reason I have a feeling this exact situation will happen to me at least once in my life  
No lasting effects. The biggest cost was the plane ticket.  I think a round trip was $700.  The drugs and the room and the sex probably cost me another 1300-ish.  It was pretty fucking cheap, really. But I'm really, really fortunate.  I was suicidal, so I wasn't concerned with survival.  My coke was definitely cut with other shit, and I don't know what.  Could have been Ajax for all I knew.  My cab driver could have taken me out somewhwere secluded and had me beaten and robbed for my money.  I was mixing uppers and downers.  Easily could have killed myself.   Not to mention risk of addiction.   I'm not saying never take drugs, but there are ways of taking drugs that don't bring you to the brink of ruin.  
Why a round trip if you wanted to off yourself? Comfort of your own home and all that?  
I didn't buy a round trip, actually.  I went with a one-way ticket.  I was just guesstimating on the round trip cost.

How dangerous is Tijuana? congrats on your trip btw.  
I had a death wish, so I was stumbling through the streets drunk at 2am.  I went down alleys and everything else.  It was creepy as fuck, but nothing happened to me.  Probably dumb luck. I think if you stick to the populated touristy areas you'll be completely safe.  There are LOTS of cops there.  It was funny, but outside of every major brothel there were always a bunch of cops standing around to keep order.    
I'm glad you're still around, but shit, that's ballsy, man. What ethnicity are you? I'm Hispanic, but you couldn't pay me enough to walk down those streets. And it sucks, cause I kinda need to go down there to get some dental work done. Last time I went, I was 16 years old or so and had a group of guys in a truck pointing their rifles at me cause I had long hair at the time.   
Part Hispanic, but not enough that they didn't all know I was a gringo.   I wasn't ballsy.  I just didn't care what happened to me.  It was like playing a first person version of Grand Theft Auto.  Totally did not give a shit about anything.

There have been recent reports of "Death by Cows" to many hikers in the UK and other counties. How do you feel this is changing peoples perception of the friendly cows we knew in the 90s? Cow Crime seems to be on the rise.  Source: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/07/hiker-gored-to-death-by--in-austrian-alps  
I can't defend the cow in question but I believe that while cow crime IS on the rise, it is most likely due to extrinsic factors, as the vast majority of cows are docile and friendly, more research should be put into cow communities to understand the psyche and reasoning a rogue cow has.  
I'm pretty sure rogue cows have just had too much to drink. But I'm not the expert. https://i1.wp.com/www.besttastingspirits.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rogue-Cow-Cookies-and-Cream-Liqueur-Copy.jpg

So if I told you I had an IEP meeting later today in the MP with 2 different APs and that B2SN is next week, do you think I should still have to attend the PTCs I have scheduled?  While we're on the subject, what do you think about the GRR method of CM? Have you tried it in relation to SysELD?

ok, how did you score all your touchdowns?  
Rebbitors have shit for defense cuz the admins banned all the good football men and now its sooooo easy to score a touchdown 🏈 on a field of unsuspecting crybabies, lol.   TLDR: Sal plays for the winning team 😎✌

If you're willing to break character, I'd love to know what inspired you to make this absolutely legendary troll account, and what went into creating the character that was Sal Bundry?  
I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days. The reason I'm ending my trolling is because this was, by a long shot, my favorite characterization, and I don't see myself gaining any further satisfaction from any other idea at this time. Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal. I received so many messages of love and hate! An important point to mention: given my history of working with people with mental illness, I was careful about going over the line. If I thought I had done so, I would shoot a PM to the user. I did this as recently as 1 or 2 days prior to the suspension of my account. Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.  
Holy shit. Were you GivesFreeCompliments or one of those types? I really wish I could know if I ever saw your comments from your positive account  
First thing I thought, too. That ban was really unfair.

And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.  
I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days. The reason I'm ending my trolling is because this was, by a long shot, my favorite characterization, and I don't see myself gaining any further satisfaction from any other idea at this time. Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal. I received so many messages of love and hate! An important point to mention: given my history of working with people with mental illness, I was careful about going over the line. If I thought I had done so, I would shoot a PM to the user. I did this as recently as 1 or 2 days prior to the suspension of my account. Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me.

Wow... I don’t even know what else to say. You’re a good person, and your contributions will be missed. And I guess since this is probably goodbye, I should probably also thank you for all the laughs at times where I really needed it. Those five touchdowns made my day better so many times when I needed something stupid and trivial and funny to laugh about. Many times you gave me (and so many others) a desperately-needed escape from the real world, if only for a moment. You brought a lot of joy to a lot of people’s lives, and I hope you always remember that. So thank you, Sal, for being the most memorable troll to ever score five touchdowns in one game of American football back in high school.

Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal. I received so many messages of love and hate! An important point to mention: given my history of working with people with mental illness, I was careful about going over the line. If I thought I had done so, I would shoot a PM to the user. I did this as recently as 1 or 2 days prior to the suspension of my account. Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.

I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days.

Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.  
I'm only going to break character once. To address the name, Sal_Bundry_5TDs1Game, that's a direct reference to Al Bundy, the lead character from Married With Children. He scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game, was married, and had 2 kids, etc. It's a wonderful show with jokes that match my sens of humor; it gets my highest recommendation. I find it hilarious, and I loved how the character lampooned many things that we find silly in what can be seen as a stereotypical middle-aged man with regrets, who has little left in life but his warped worldview and his glory days. The reason I'm ending my trolling is because this was, by a long shot, my favorite characterization, and I don't see myself gaining any further satisfaction from any other idea at this time. Regarding my beliefs: I don't personally believe many of the things I've said, except that people are too sensitive. I'll expand on this a bit later.  Since I'm not using this account anymore, here's the truth. I actually used to have an account here, for about 4-5 years, that contributed very positively to the website. I helped literally thousands of people, and I truly put my heart into it because I wanted to encourage positivity in every way possible. That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal.

That account ended up suspended because of a brigade from a number of users who didn't like the "excessive positivity." When I tried to reason with the administrators, they weren't very open to helping me. For a short while, I tried to recreate an account like this, but since they knew my IP address, they suspended me within days. They quite literally prevented me from continuing to help people the way I had been for years. I think you can understand how that can affect someone's attitude towards a website. That was a few years ago. Despite the amount of time that's passed, I'm still quite reluctant to put my heart into another "positive" account. I had a few troll accounts a couple of years ago which were closed within 1 or 2 weeks. At this point, I'm only using this account (as well as the prior Sal account), and only on this website. I don't care nearly as much about these because even though I did put some time and effort into Sal, it doesn't carry the type of heavy 'baggage' that my prior account entailed. A pertinent point is that, while I was using that positive account, I was always a fan of troll accounts because they brought a type of entertainment that required people to escape the confines of their regular way of thinking in order to enjoy them. I still enjoy troll accounts greatly, and am a fan of virtually all of the ones that go beyond simply swearing or throwing out racial slurs. My philosophy regarding troll accounts is that you can either choose to get angry at them, ignore them, or laugh along with them. I choose to laugh along, especially those rare times when I fall for a troll. What I think people liked about my account it that it became funny once they understood that it was a troll - because they realized there was nothing to be mad about in the first place. I took advantage of Reddit’s voting system to point out how people get mad and overreact to nonsensical comments. It's a reminder that we shouldn’t take the internet or ourselves too seriously, as we often tend to do. As such, I had intended to continue using Sal as long as I was still able to, because it brought myself and quite a few followers some simple, skewed kind of entertainment, even if it's just simply memeing the "5 touchdowns in 1 game" deal. I received so many messages of love and hate! An important point to mention: given my history of working with people with mental illness, I was careful about going over the line. If I thought I had done so, I would shoot a PM to the user. I did this as recently as 1 or 2 days prior to the suspension of my account. Sometimes I would go overboard - but I'm just a human, and I acknowledge that I am imperfect and make mistakes, like anyone else - including those who banned and suspended me. When I was running the positive account, I always emphasized trying to empathize with others and understand their point of view, no matter their background or history. And here I am, just one example of an imperfect human being. I think that if we can openly acknowledge our own imperfections as people, we can become far more humble and happy. Because I recognize myself as an equal to anyone else with whom I interact, I don't seek out the satisfaction of correcting someone or reacting angrily when they say I disagree with. I see it as an opportunity to talk to them so that they can learn from me, and more importantly, I can learn from them. Because, my friends - I have so much left to learn in this limited time I have on this planet.  People have asked about my career / job in real life. I'm a medical student in the US, finishing up my 3rd year on an individualized schedule. I will be a licensed physician in 2021. I've used the lessons I have learned on Reddit to make myself a better healthcare provider. I learned to listen to people better, how to ask the proper questions, how to provide empathy at the right time, and how to acknowledge the limitations of my own knowledge. I've had excellent, meaningful interactions with patients, healthcare providers at all levels, and with my fellow students. In my view, this blatantly defies the idea of trolls as completely asocial or antisocial people who run to the internet for attention and interaction which they are incapable of receiving in the real world. This account has been a fun way to fill moments of stress or waiting around (and these can happen frequently in the hospital!), but I have certainly spent more time on it than I had intended. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did it and I am happy to finish my trolling 'career' with this account. The timing was just fine. I've probably stated more about myself than I should have, but I hope that this provides you some insight into the human being behind Sal. I also hope that you can all take my lesson of empathy and humility, and apply it to yourself and others for the benefit of yourself and everyone around you. Life's too short to be angry at things out of our control, so let's make the conscious choice to take upon everything that happens with as much humanity as we can.  
If you're willing to break character, I'd love to know what inspired you to make this absolutely legendary troll account, and what went into creating the character that was Sal Bundry?

Wiping is for nerds (and I beet nerds up).

Sal, what do you think of rugby as compared to american football? In my opinion, a man of your skill would greatly improve without the need of protection, in favor of superior speed as to score more touchdowns.  
I won't lie when I say that ragby is a good sport, but it's still nothing compared to American football. The strategies and formations used in American football are far more elusive and require more critical thinking in very short time frames then any other sport in existence. Only men of truly high entellegence, agility, strength, speed, handsomeness, charisma, and teamwork can succeed at a sport as substantial as football. The reisin that football requires hell mats is because it is so much rougher then ragby. Just think about.  
There was actually a fight about this during Halloween between like 30 people or somethin’ on the street, ironic I’d see it a few days later.  
That's all? I would of beet them up in a heart beet. I was a professional footballer, I can just run through them and they'd collapse and crack like a bunch of flimsy plastic pins getting hit by a heavy metal bowling bowl (I was also an expert bowler, if you didn't know, I won many of my teem's games).

Alright spill it. Did Epstein kill himself or not?  
Jefferson Eppenstein is a weekling. I secretly came into his cell and shoved a football so far up his wrecked 'em that he was spitting out peaces of rope, which I than used to brake his neck. Only someone with immanse agility like mine (that of a football player who scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game in high school) could of achieved something like this without being seen. I truly am a international hero.  
You’re my hero, a true American patriot who stops at nothing to reveal the injustices in this world. See you in the history books.  
I should already be in the history books (even though I am currently present (not the "gift" type of present (but the "time" type of present)) and history is the past (but I've already accomplished much in the past (which is history (and should be in the history books (which are currently present))))). Besides, how can I see you in a history book if I'm not in the book? This commint makes no sans, so I recommend you delete it before you get downloaded.

He got his acct deleted? When did this happen and why? Was he automatically banned for low karma?  
he was banned because of a comment  
What did the comment say? What Reddit rule did he break? Or are the admins just nazis?

Sal, was your goals always 500,000 or were you going to attempt to reach 1,000,000 or beyond befor you were cut down unjustly? And also a follow up, any messages to the new generation of people  who are bound follow in your path in what you do here on reddit  
One of my favorite peeple, the Profit of Weasely! Tank you for the question. My original goal was never to obtain any downloads at all. It appears that the peeple did not understand the wisdom that emenated from my keyboard at which I had typed (and which I am still using (I can't afford another one (the economy's rough and I'm not getting payed enough (something which my big red lazy wife refuses to understand (she keeps begging me for the sex and money (neither of which I have nor do I want to give her)))))), and as a result, they had downloaded me. It was very shocking. However, I alter understood that the downloads were a sign that my teachings were being understood and appreciated. Teaching is never easy, and someone who wants to learn must feel the pain of being wrong in order to learn. If that means I receive a download, than so be it, as long as my lessons come through clear and wide, much like the passes I received in order to score my touchdowns (of which I scored 5 in 1 game in high school in 1969 (still an unbeeten record)). As a result, I became proud of my downloads. Once I reached 500,000 downloads I understood that I had broken through to many peeple. I had contributed to my goal of Reviving Rebbit. My advice to the new generations (including melleneials and generation Zika kiddies) is to listen to the older peeple's advice. They've been around for a long time and have seen things that your yet to learn. They may not always be right, and they might be stuck in there old ways, but there worth listening to, because by listening to there life experience, you might be able to avoid making the same miss steaks they made. Especially marriage. Marriage is the biggest miss steak that any man can make. Don't get marred, boys. Just make the sex at as many young, single girls as you possibly can and run away. You'll live a much heppier life.

Sal why would you leave us I can give you a presidential pardon for all your wife's grievances  
Think about it this way: I scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game, and I collected 500,000 downloads on 1 Rebbit account. Now, I also scored plenty of touchdowns in other games, but I am not counting those in the game in which I scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game, because it's a different game. Anal ogously, creating a new Rebbit account is the same as starting a new game. I'm heppy with the 5 touchdowns I scored in my final game, and am heppy with what I had done on my original Rebbit account. I have Revived Rebbit, and I trust that my followers will carry on my legend. It is how the world works: the young stand on the shoulders (which, in football players like me, are very wide and strong (tanks to the hours of strength training, practice, and amazing jeans passed down from my parents)) of the old and move the world forward.  
What if I made you vice president of the dead presidents committee?

Sal, there are rumors that on the night that you threw 5 tds in one game you also slept with 5 women in one night...is this true?  
Well, BaseballJon, as it turns out my future redhead of a wife, Pug (or as I'd call her when I'm trying to calm her, Puggy), was my exclusive girlfriend at the time. The lucky broad snatched me and she was the only one I slept with that night. But I'll tell you, I will tell you this, I'll tell ya, she got a Sallin' 5 (five) times like no other five (5) women could handle in there lifetimes. This 9.83" SALamander (that's big, folks) is as good as they come.  
Alpha as fuck, bro.  I mean, i woulda fucked at least 5 chicks after such an accomplishment, but you just put five loads into the same girl? Man, i cant even...ur such an inspiration for family values and football. Pug is a lucky woman.

Honoured to meet you Sal, been a longtime fan. Do you recall your favourite moment/comment in your time on Rebbit?  
I was waiting for this one! I have many personnel favorites, but this one takes the cack. I was working on variations of it for a few months (a month is between 28 (twenty eight) and 32 (thirty to) days (meaning I worked on it over a period of more then 28 to 32 days)). I will add some more favorites later on because I have many questions hear, and I can't answer them all at once (I'm only one man (something I wish my wife understood when she begs me to bring home money and make the sex at her and do the housework)). Others commints and posts I liked: 1 (one) 2 (two) 3 (tree) 4 (for) 5 (five (scroll down for this one - it's neer the bottom)) 6 (sex) 7 (seven)

Sal what's your opinion on Wesley Ford?  
Weasely is a good man to whom the peeple of Rebbit should listen. I say with the utmost confidence that he can lead the peeple of Rebbit to a better tomorrow. He can help Revive Rebbit.

Sal - first off I want to say that I will greatly miss you. Not only was ur football career cut short unfairly but s was ur rebbit career. My question for you is how do we revive rebbit with u gone? U led this whole operation but now we are losing you...  On a lighter note any predictions for the pats ravens game?  
I will always be in you're hearts and minds. You have seen what I have done, and while nobody can be as legendary as I am, you can follow my footsteps and do as I have done. Let the name of Sal ring through the threads of Rebbit forever! Do not let the name or the touchdowns (of which I scored 5 in 1 game in high school) ever be forgotten as long as you are a Rebbitor. Their is no doubt in my mind that the Patriots will win. There just giving the Ravings an easy 1rd (first) half game in order to fool them.

Why did you pick Cheers Married with Children as your inspiration for the troll account?  
As it turns out, that tevelision show was inspired by me! I scored my 5 touchdowns in 1 game in high school in 1969, and that show came around nearly 20 (twenty) years later. I find it silly that you'd think my life was expired by something created long after I'd gone through the best years of my life. I don't think you understand how time works, bucko. Something that hapins after something else hapins after it, not before it. The thing that hapins after is inspired by the thing before it, not the other way around. Because something that takes before can't be effected by something that takes place after it because time doesn't go backwards (unless we have a time machine (and my only time machine is my mammory (which I have to visit often to escape the horror of my daily life and daily wife (I often remember scoring 5 touchdowns in 1 game (it's undoubtedly the best mammory I ever had))))).  
Why did you pick Cheers Married with Children as your inspiration for the troll account?  
It’s not Cheers, It’s Al Bundy from Married with Children.

Since your account got suspended by admins, what do you plan to do now? Also, what advice could you give somebody for becoming as successful as you?  
I am a busy man who has a wife, kids, and a job selling sandals to women so obees, they have changed the earth's gravitational forces to the extent that it might start hurdling towards the sun. I hope that would be the case, because that would mean my misery as a marred man will soon end. But in the meantime, this is all I have: a wife and kids, but at least I have Sunday football and my dog Fuck Bundry to keep my company. To those who want to be as successful as me: practice football. Practice hard. Make sure you're parents give you good jeans so you can inherit the ideal strength, handsomeness, and entellegence you need to play football like a star. Never get marred, and always be shellfish (accept when you play football) because in this lifetime, your the only person you have to care for yourself. And praise the one man (me (Sal Bundry)) who is humble enough to score 5 touchdowns in 1 game, yet still come hear and give out this sage wisdom to everyone.

Why didn't you score 6 touchdowns in one game? Are you too weak?  
Football is a game of teamwork. In order to achieve the highest score possible for my team, I had to share some of my potential touchdowns with my teammates. That's the magic of football: you have to create plays that involve not only yourself, but everyone else. Shellfishness would only lead to a lower score for my team. This is the sacrifice that I, the mighty Sal Bundry, made for the glory of my team. It is the reisin that, even though I could of done better, my achievement is still renowned worldwide.  
I think I just gained an IQ point  
nah my IQ just doubled

Vegetables are for chickens. When one Bundry hurts himself, the rest of us laugh. Sal Bundry is cursed, but Sal Bundry never quits because a quitter does not score 5 touchdowns in 1 game.

Those of us who are older and wiser, and who write proper sentences with proper Englash grammar, spelling, and diction, are not all familiar with the nonsensical meme-like shortenings that you use. It's far better for those of us who are educated (like me) if you write out the full words, so that we can reed it quicker and easier, then formulate an appropriate respons. By writing in this manner, your making yourself look less educated and nobody will take what you say seriously. So try again, and this time don't write like a 12 years old, ok?

What do you do in real life (hobbies, career, etc) outside of being rebbits best poster ever?  Why did you create the Sal account? Just for fun, some sort of experiment?

Sal, what will you be up to after your legendairy Rebbit (social media platform) career ends?  
My parents homeschooled me and my little brother to shelter us from "the gays." We both ended up transgender and my older brother is gay. AMA
How did they take that?   
Pretty horribly. My older brother called my dad and told him. He responded “WHAT? I’M GOING TO HANG UP SO I DON’T SAY SOMETHING I REGRET” a month later he talked to him about it, gave him a Bible, told him he was going to hell, never to mention it, and continuously tells him that he can change and he needs to have a wife one day. My mom used to always tell me “he thinks it’s not a choice, but we know better than that.” I’m not out as trans because of the reaction they had with my little brother (I’m waiting until I’m out of the house), but they know that I’m attracted to girls. I wrote a six page letter explaining everything and a week later my dad forced me to talk to him about it. He told me the same thing he told my brother. He said he will never accept it “You made good points, but I feel like God is testing me so I will never accept it.” I cut my hair at the beginning of the year and occasionally he brings it up because I’m “rubbing it in his face” and sometimes threatens to kick me out because of it. My relationship with him has never been the same since. I’m scared of him now. My mom just ignores it mostly and we’ve gotten closer, but mostly agrees with him. My little brother already had short hair when I came out as gay so my dad figured something was up. Right after he made me talk to him, he forced my little brother to come out to him. He came out to him as nonbinary (months later he realized he’s actually ftm). There were weeks of yelling. Weeks of “YOU’RE MENTALLY ILL. YOU NEED THERAPY.” He posted on Instagram that night that he was afraid he was going to be sent to conversion therapy because that’s what had been threatened whenever the topic of transgender people was brought up. Eventually that calmed down a little bit, but when we were on vacation he decided to bring it up every time someone didn’t immediately gender him female. Because of this, he got his phone taken away. They went through it and saw that he was also panromantic and asexual (and had a girlfriend). More yelling and threatening conversion therapy. They kept his phone until he started acting cis and straight. His phone was gone for almost a year. He still doesn’t have internet access and they constantly look through his phone. They delete every contact who calls him by his preferred name/pronouns. Now he has long pink hair and only wears female clothes (including skirts) along with make up and painted nails. I was called mentally ill when I defended him (all I did was say that it shouldn’t matter what section he gets his clothes from). This past year I have been so scared that we’ll find him dead one day. He always jokes about suicide and he’s told me that he wants to give himself top surgery and doesn’t care if he bleeds out. He’s that desperate for a flat chest. Every time he does so much as wear multiple sports bras, the yelling will start again.

In all fairness, you guys might be mentally ill. But PTSD is a bigger worry to me than gender disphorea.  I was talking to a friend today about this sort of thing. Part of the social problem in Western culture is that we treat mental illnesses like they're a defect in the human condition, and that they need curing. You could just as easily argue that belief in an invisible and unknowable deity is a mental illness. The ability to ignore purely rational logic in favor of personal experience should be a diagnostic indication for mental illness.  And yet that's accepted as normal mental functioning. Maybe there is a God that hates homosexuality. Maybe he also hates shellfish and shirts with mixed fibers. If we accept that he loves us and died for us, we should also be able to accept that he died for Red Lobster as much as for pride parades.  And if being queer is an affliction of the mind, like schizoaffective disorder or bipolar spectrum disorder, or autism, or cerebral palsy, or downs syndrome, or even just boring old depression, then all those other people are abominations too.  And that seems a bit... Extreme. Does God need to forgive someone for their bipolar issues? It seems like a stretch.  Either way, it doesn't seem like God would be for torturing your children because of their sexuality. Were the sodomites destroyed because they did butt stuff, or because they wanted to rape angels? I dunno, but one of those things seems a little worse than the other. God seems pretty offended by "abusers of mankind," but I'm not sure that the things lovers do can be called abuse.  I think the things you describe your father doing can be described as abuse, though. Mental abuse, surely. If your child asks for bread, do you give him a stone? Is that what God is to him? Wrath and stones? Jesus had some pretty strong silent moments with people who picked up stones once.   
Believing in your invisible best friend in the sky makes you crazy.   Believing in my invisible best friend in the sky makes you normal. This is why we can't have nice things.

I just wanted to come by and give you props for the most scriptural defense of queer identities I have ever heard. Thank you. I was on the fence about this particular topic, and your post pushed me over to the side of "being queer is not a sin in God's eyes". And now I feel like that stance is not just feeling based, but based in scripture as well.

It's emotional and verbal abuse. You made some good points, but lost me when you questioned if it was abuse and then conceded slightly that it could be mental abuse. It's abusive. OP mentioned fear and living in constant fear is indicative of an abusive homelife. Not being able to be honest without getting yelled at is intimidation and intimidating your children to bend to your will every day and punishing any other behvaior is abusive.

I just wanna say that this was a bit confusing to read, no hate against any of you but clarifying everyone's "cis" gender or whatever in the beginning would help make this a lot more readable.   
My older brother is a cis AMAB (assigned male at birth) person. Me and my little brother are both trans AFAB (assigned female at birth) people.

My heart breaks for you and your brothers. I'm a trans man and I shared a lot of those feelings with your little brother, but I was lucky to have supportive family and friends. Please look after each other.  If it is possible for your little brother to see a trans friendly counsellor without your parents finding out I highly recommend it.  He needs a good support network and having his phone taken away and no internet access makes that extremely difficult. If he gets access back Telegram is an Instant Messenger that allows a password and the option to have chats delete themselves when closed or after a period of time.  I'm sure there are similar apps.  That's a truly awful situation and straight up abusive. People may argue it isn't abuse, but personally knowing dysphoria and seeing similar situations for other trans people it's extremely abusive and more importantly deadly. Always take his mentions of suicide and self harm seriously.   If it is possible for him to move out and at the very least transition in terms of hair, clothing, social factors, etc he should. Even if your parents threaten to cut him off, he should. His own wellbeing is more important than abusive family. Take care. I'm very concerned and I hope things get better soon.

They went through it and saw that he was also panromantic and asexual (and had a girlfriend). More yelling and threatening conversion therapy. They kept his phone until he started acting cis and straight. His phone was gone for almost a year. He still doesn’t have internet access and they constantly look through his phone. They delete every contact who calls him by his preferred name/pronouns. Now he has long pink hair and only wears female clothes (including skirts) along with make up and painted nails. I was called mentally ill when I defended him (all I did was say that it shouldn’t matter what section he gets his clothes from). This past year I have been so scared that we’ll find him dead one day. He always jokes about suicide and he’s told me that he wants to give himself top surgery and doesn’t care if he bleeds out. He’s that desperate for a flat chest. Every time he does so much as wear multiple sports bras, the yelling will start again.  
Pretty horribly. My older brother called my dad and told him. He responded “WHAT? I’M GOING TO HANG UP SO I DON’T SAY SOMETHING I REGRET” a month later he talked to him about it, gave him a Bible, told him he was going to hell, never to mention it, and continuously tells him that he can change and he needs to have a wife one day. My mom used to always tell me “he thinks it’s not a choice, but we know better than that.” I’m not out as trans because of the reaction they had with my little brother (I’m waiting until I’m out of the house), but they know that I’m attracted to girls. I wrote a six page letter explaining everything and a week later my dad forced me to talk to him about it. He told me the same thing he told my brother. He said he will never accept it “You made good points, but I feel like God is testing me so I will never accept it.” I cut my hair at the beginning of the year and occasionally he brings it up because I’m “rubbing it in his face” and sometimes threatens to kick me out because of it. My relationship with him has never been the same since. I’m scared of him now. My mom just ignores it mostly and we’ve gotten closer, but mostly agrees with him. My little brother already had short hair when I came out as gay so my dad figured something was up. Right after he made me talk to him, he forced my little brother to come out to him. He came out to him as nonbinary (months later he realized he’s actually ftm). There were weeks of yelling. Weeks of “YOU’RE MENTALLY ILL. YOU NEED THERAPY.” He posted on Instagram that night that he was afraid he was going to be sent to conversion therapy because that’s what had been threatened whenever the topic of transgender people was brought up. Eventually that calmed down a little bit, but when we were on vacation he decided to bring it up every time someone didn’t immediately gender him female. Because of this, he got his phone taken away.

Is religion involved in any way?  
Yup. My parents are both very religious. When we came out my dad gave us each a Bible and a sermon to read and told us we were going to hell if we didn’t follow it.

Pretty sure the Bible says it's not up to you to decide if someone goes to Hell or not, and preaches forgiveness and such. No clue why people do the exact opposite.

Can you talk about your and your brothers' processes of self-discovery?  
I don’t really know about my brothers. All I know is that my older brother was in college and my little brother was about 15 when they realized. For me, there were a lot of points in my life where I knew I was trans, but didn’t accept it or thought “not yet.” I realized I liked girls at 15. I realized I only liked girls at 18. The girl I was dating at the time referred to me as a woman and I cried myself to sleep so I figured something was up but I didn’t really know. Not long after that, I saw that one of my favorite youtubers came out as a trans guy (well first he came out as nonbinary and then a few months later came out as ftm). I related to every single thing he said so I started questioning my gender. Meanwhile I was trying to become more visible as a lesbian so I started wearing snapbacks. Whenever I didn’t wear a snapback a guy would flirt with me and I hated it so I made the decision to cut my hair so I would still be visible even if I didn’t feel like wearing a hat that day. By that point I was like 60% sure I was trans, but not 100%. I luckily pass very well with short hair so people immediately started calling me he and I absolutely loved it. Someone on Reddit also told me what the diagnosis criteria of gender dysphoria was because I said something like “I want to be a man, but that doesn’t make a trans because I don’t have dysphoria.” That’s when I was 100% sure.  That was probably very jumbled and didn’t make sense. Sorry about that.  
Im so glad that Miles could inspire other people to discover themselves!  
He’s amazing. I don’t know where I would be if I never found him

Does the rest of your family support you?   
I’m not out to the rest of my family. I don’t talk to them very often so it just hasn’t come up yet (I haven’t really started transitioning yet so I don’t really need to yet). Most of them are supportive of the LGBT community so I’m assuming they will be once I tell them.

I’m curious to see if there’s a genetic aspect to it since 3/3 kids are either gay or transgender. Do you have any relatives you know of (like aunts or uncles or cousins) that are gay and could your dad be closeted?  
Well it’s actually 3/5. We also have two other older siblings. No one in our extended family is out. It’s possible that some people are closeted though. One of my uncles has never had a long term girlfriend (I’m pretty sure the longest one lasted two months). My little brother seems to think pretty much everyone is a closeted bisexual though.  
How do you get on with your other 2 siblings?

Sexuality is a mix of genetic, hormonal and prenatal factors, and there's still much discussion on the topic. The overall consensus is that there isn't one main factor.  Being transgender is considered to be mainly dependent on development in the womb, but not because of the womb environment itself. Transwomen for example are trans mainly because androgen receptors etc in the brain don't work like they were supposed to, kind of just by accident, because humans are complicated and things sometimes don't work as intended (not all the 'cogs and gears function properly). This is in no way to say trans people are 'broken' or anything of the sort, but what it does mean is that it helps explain why their gender identity differs from their physical body.  The brain essentially has a blueprint that's telling it how the body is going to be built, but then something goes wrong on the bodys end, and when the brain looks around it's like, 'the fuck is this nonsense???' and that's gender dysphoria, when the brain's idea of what it should be is different from what's actually there, leading to a desire to have your body look 'different,'  in order to make it match what the brain is constantly telling you it should be. You can see how that'd be upsetting. =/

It is definitely genetic or has a genetic component. I have a friend that has 7 siblings. All but 1 boy and 1 girl are gay. Of course they have a super religious family but they are the accepting kind!

I mean this with no disrespect, but if someone is trasgendered AND gay, does that mean they're originally straight (mtf who's into girls, ftm who's into guys) or like, straight but in reverse (mtf who's into males, ftm who's into females)? how is that handled that from their perspective? also, are there any profound stigmas that you've noticed now that you've come out? i have two transgendered friends, one of which is very androgenous and could pass for either gender, and one who is quite obviously... well, very tall and muscular with a beard, but identifies as a woman. so i sometimes wonder what every day life must be like for them. i've always been curious how generally people who are transgendered are treated in public or by strangers you see in day to day life, but frankly i've been too much of a chickenshit to bring it up personally with my friends. i would imagine it's easier if the person sort of looks the part yeah? like if you're a rather girly looking man who identifies as a female it's easier for strangers to accept that compared to someone with facial hair. of course, most people would try to be civil about it or just give that stilted "okay" but i find you can see it in their eyes if they're just humoring you or being polite for the sake of it, and that has to weigh on the soul a little bit - that doesn't even cover outright bigots or people who just "don't get it." like take for example, you're at a concert or a show and you're invited on stage to be part of the act, whether its a performance piece, a comedy set, or a concert. and the host introduces you as "this fine young gentleman/lady" - do you correct them, or do you just let it slide? because if you accept and are fine with being misgendered, fine, but if you're not, and you correct them, you take the risk of their reaction and the crowd's reaction if you don't entirely look the part. i'm quite socially anxious so that kind of deliberation would probably kill me. i imagine you'd just need to have a really good set of humor about it, but i'd like to hear how you would handle something like that.  
People who are attracted to the same gender as themselves are considered gay. If I’m in a situation where everyone thinks I’m a girl, I’ll say that I’m gay, but if I’m in a situation where I’m out or people think I’m male I’ll say that I’m straight. On Reddit, sometimes I’ll say “I’m a straight guy” other times I’ll just say “I’m attracted to the same sex” and other times “I’m attracted to the opposite gender” depending on the context. The worst that I’ve gotten is judgmental stares when I need to go into the women’s restroom or changing room for whatever reason. Luckily, I pass pretty well. I told people in my dance class that I don’t have preferred pronouns because I didn’t want to come out yet, but I also didn’t want to tell them to call me she. I told one of my friends in that class that I prefer he/him, but that’s it. I noticed that as soon as it got too hot in the room and I took off my shirt and only wore a sports bra, my friend started calling me they and other people only called me she. I will never correct somebody if I’m misgendered. I will only correct somebody if I’m in a public restroom with someone I know and someone confronts me.

Since these are all more general questions, you'd probably be better off taking them to /r/asktransgender. Better sample size there than just one. Folks there are generally pretty welcoming so long as you're not outright bigoted, and you seem more like someone who genuinely just wants to learn.  
i try to speak cautiously as i am from a fairly conservative background. my early behavior was shaped by people who do not take kindly to all of this new gender identity stuff. but to be honest, some of the most down to earth, relaxed, fun to be around people i've ever met have been... differently oriented, to say.  so i do still have a great many questions and confusions but i often hold my tongue, save my curt lexicon be construed for insensitivity.

If it’s creating such a toxic and abusive environment for your brother who’s a minor, I could highly consider getting CPS involved for his wellbeing and maybe they can even help you. I’m not well versed in the services they offer but please check into it because your parents aren’t helping you and your brother whatsoever. Hope it all gets better.

So I don't have much knowledge with this so forgive me if this sounds insensitive, but if your brother is trans and gay, does that mean he was straight when he was a man?  
My older brother is cis and gay. My little brother is trans and panromantic. If one of my brothers was both trans and gay, that would mean that he would’ve been seen as straight when he was seen as female

How did you lose your virginity?   
I was in McDonald's once, and the guy sweeping the floor (who was about 50) came up to me and said "you know, I can always come back to your place and help tidy up" (in Spanish obviously) and then had a laughing fit and sat down opposite me until a other employee had to take him away

On the one hand she's being deceitful. On the other hand, she's working the gig economy and legitimately delivering product for paid services.  If she's getting the jobs because some people are more willing to "judge a book by the cover," yet she's fulfilling the jobs productively --it's hard not to admire her social exploitation of the market.  After all, any client is paying for product, not the person.   
This is not a person you should admire, read some of her other comments and posts, she is clearly suffering from a mental disorder, she can’t even control what personality she is in. She feels that some days she just becomes one of her personalities, without free will, this is, without doubt, not a AMA, this is an outreach for help, even if she didn’t realize that when she made the post. we should be careful promoting mental disease like this.   
What if every person commenting in this thread is just her, on a new alt account. This whole thread is just an echo chamber

My girlfriend does the exact same thing. She fakes pictures. She basically creates a new face.  
ELI5 how to fake peoples pictures?  / Not possible unless you have insane Photoshop skills, or MIT-level AI skills (there are working ones, but not release yet). Though give it 3-7 more years, and we will have the first working AI face-generator on Github.  
First she decides how her new persona should approx look. Then she finds pictures of people  looking like that. Then she remixes all of those face into her new face

Still not sure how these fake personas make you money? Do you run a webdesign company and these fake people applied to your real company? or are these fake personas also webdesigners and you just do their work?  
She does their work. She sells comics through Tom and does websites through Frank.  
Using different identities to create online personas that she uses to market stuff . Like she mentioned the Instagram famous one , 24k is less but someday when she crosses the 100k mark you can charge people money to promote stuff !   
If you have enough identities, you can just promote your own stuff!  It's the Unidan model.

Essentially she took advantage of people’s natural biases.  
What does that even mean? It is a lot of words that don't add up to a claim--she literally does the work she advertises, just under different identities, which are all the same level of unreal--and aren't necessarily more unreal than her normative identity. So what are these "natural biases"?

Do you ever make mistakes changing between personas from different countries? British people can speak quite differently from Americans for instance. You said the London persona gets sent free food, but don't you need to get this sent to a country different to where you're claiming to be from?   
Yeah little discrepancies like this make me question the legitimacy of the entire thing. OP still didn't detail how these accounts really make money anyway.  
They all presumably are home businesses.  My question is how the income is registered for OP, because income from each one of the fake persona's businesses could add up to tax fraud i think. Unless she just counts it as unspecified income on her real identity.

I'm sensing that i'm picking up on Eva's personality quite a lot during the week.   
This is the most worrying part of the thread. You're picking up on her personality? SHE'S NOT REAL! It's you! It's your personality!  It sounds like you're wasting a lot of time on these. You say they bring in money but you're the boss of a company? If your web design 'personailty' brings in 30% of your income, why don't you invest that energy in sales for your actual real business?  I also find it worrying that you're deceiving people in saying you're earning a PHD and talking about politics in a completely different country, when you have none of the qualifications to back it up. It's dangerous territory and I'd be very surprised if you're not spreading false information to people who listen. Just because you can speak the language, doesn't mean you know as much as a master's student!!

Don't call them fake, call them pen names, or nom de plumes.  I think that is what they really are. I can't see anything wrong with what you are doing  
Pen Names are a fake name used by an author. They're not anything like this  
Authors write books for money. A modern online freelancer/entrepreneur writes blogs, takes photos, shoots videos, writes code etc for money. It's not that distant IMO. Words tend to be applied in new areas even when the things are only vaguely similar.  For instance, birds and aeroplanes have "wings", even when they are not very similar at all. However, they both provide lift, and that's close enough for us to use the same word for them.  
Yeah but she's probably using other people's pictures to do this. I doubt she's using stock images for all these personas. I mean it's not that unethical, but I wouldn't want someone essentially impersonating me with my pictures.

Have you read her comments? She has a split personality disorder, she can’t even control when and what personality she becomes. This is absolutely nothing like a pen name, I’m feeling very concerned that people are so casually feeding into a severe mental illness.  This person could very easily hurt her/himself or those around them with this type of behaviour.

I'm sooo confused why sooo many people spend sooo much time writing these looong detailed posts that are so clearly made up. There are so many inconsistencies in this 'story' its mindblowing that people take it seriously. Also, an AMA with no questions answered should be a good sign they FOS.

Iam Ecka6, I'm caught in the middle of the Unidan shitstorm, AMA!
Are you concerned that you might start developing a drug habit with your newly found fame?  
Definitely, I'll do an AmA when I get out of rehab.  
I love that you're kind of a Reddit celebrity...and you have negative karma to your name without trolling. Can't remember that ever happening before.  
Iam Ecka6, I'm caught in the middle of the Unidan shitstorm, AMA!
It's cool that you're taking this well and laughing at the absurdity.  Unidan is usually very calm and nice so it was really weird when he flipped out on you. The screeches of all those jackdaws made him finally have a bad day.  You should head to the Winchester for a pint!   
Thanks! I don't know what other way to take it haha I kinda felt bad for being annoying enough to make him activate caps lock...  
He must have been having a shit day. And he didn't get in trouble for yelling at you; it was for vote cheating.  I'm just glad to see you taking it lightly and having fun. There is always drama on reddit, and people love it whether they admit it or not.   
I was actually having a bad day, which is why I was stupid enough to get into a fucking argument about crows in the first place! To be honest, I'm getting much more love than hate, it's just that my karma states the opposite!

Am I the only one who never heard the term "jackdaw" before?  
I doubt it, just call them crows :P  
Oooh ffs, a jackdaw is a crow.  
Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

I'd only heard of it because it's the name of your ship in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. And another pirate laughs at you for naming your ship after a dumbass bird.

Would you rather eat one crow-sized jackdraw or one jackdraw-sized crow?

From now on, if you get downvoted I think it should be EDIT: Downvotes? Really, Unidan's alts?  
Iam Ecka6, I'm caught in the middle of the Unidan shitstorm, AMA!
Many questions here! Just what was your reaction the first time you logged in and saw this? Has anyone offered you stuff like mod positions as a way to try to make up for this? Do you have any restrictions on your account due to your negative karma?  What is something that has resulted from this that you think we wouldn't think to ask about? And finally...was it a crow or a jackdaw?  
Well, I got snapchatted a picture couple of hours ago telling me that I got Unidan banned (yes I know I didn't actually get him banned). I immediately proceeded to laugh and pace around my kitchen because I didn't know whether to log on here or not! hahah   I honestly don't know if I've been offered anything like that, I would think not because I don't deserve it just because of this lol. I still haven't gotten through my messages though!   I don't know about any restrictions actually.   :P  Oooh ffs, a jackdaw is a crow.   
Normally an account downvoted to the negatives would receive restrictions. That admins said they would try to waive that for you, considering the circumstances. Seems like they came through.  
Oh wow, they said that? That's awesome!

Glad you agree.  
Iam Ecka6, I'm caught in the middle of the Unidan shitstorm, AMA!
 I've already gotten three years worth, give it to other random users or charity or something!  Unidan had 16. I'm sure those downvoting shitheads can cough up some more.  
Whoa!

How have you coped with all the brigading? Aren't you on like -2000 karma now?  
I don't really care too much about that, I was like 'awwwww' when I first saw it, but then I burst out laughing.    I ignore Reddit for two days and I've managed to get 3000 downvotes, ha!  
It's cool that you're taking all of this so calmly, internet drama tends to be vicious for no reason. Good choice finding the imaginary internet points humorous instead of hurtful :)  
Aww, thanks!  
Iam Ecka6, I'm caught in the middle of the Unidan shitstorm, AMA!
If I buy you a pet crow, would you be willing to name it Unidan?   
Absolutely!  
Would you be willing to call it a jackdaw as well?  
Only if it's actually a jackdaw...

Congratulations on the gold and it's nice that you haven't taken the experience badly.  Not to bring up bad experiences but if you look at the end of this album it seems like you were right! Not that you'd deserve so many downvotes even if you were wrong though.  
Unidan came off as a pretentious arsehole in that argument.   
and I came out looking like an idiot! haha  
Congratulations on the gold and it's nice that you haven't taken the experience badly.  Not to bring up bad experiences but if you look at the end of this album it seems like you were right! Not that you'd deserve so many downvotes even if you were wrong though.

Honestly, this Unidan character seems like a pretty cool guy. He shares a lot of great science with the community and overall is well loved. He would be a great member of my new society.  
Plus, he can put in five votes for you in elections!

You need site wide flair with like a picture of a sling shot. You're david, you 'killed' goliath. How do you feel about him being banned?  
Hahaha that would be awesome! I dunno, I mean he deserved it if he was really making accounts to upvote himself and stuff.

Anything you want to say to /r/adviceanimals for lynch-mobbing you based on absolutely nothing?  
Not really, I still don't actually know exactly what has happened yet lol  
 Unidan got banned, and no one knew why Someone pointed out that he had been arguing with you before the ban. Conclusion: you reported him to the admins and got him banned.   
OH That makes a bit more sense then. I honestly didn't report him or anything!

Hi Ecka6! I'm really happy to see you active again. After I saw what some Redditors did with your account I was really putting this place into question, because you were arguing reasonable, polite, and patient - and that can't be valued enough. So the reaction from the mob was quite shocking for me. So, did some mods give you the idea for this AMA? I sincerely hope ( and suppose ) that you'll have tons of karma by the end of the day, you truly deserve it for not backing down. Way to go! Thanks!

How does it feel when you make the most liked man on reddit into the most hated man on reddit? People telling that he seems to be a nice guy - well maybe - but I'll be wary, what he was caught doing might just be scratching the surface. It shows a lot about his character, especially when he is a grown man with so much popularity.  
It's a really odd feeling!    
So is it crows or is it jackdaws?  
Everything is a crow, okay? EVERYTHING

I hope you've learned your lesson on crows. /s I also think that's awesome that your karma has gone from -2000 to -900.  EDIT: -393. It's interesting to see it go back up. EDIT ONE HOUR LATER: positive 130! EDIT ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF LATER: 1303! Wow! EDIT ANOTHER NINE AND A HALF LATER: 5030!

There was talk over in /r/subredditdrama that you may have been scared away from reddit due to the shitstorm and brigading.  I'm glad to see that you're taking it all in stride.   And I also noticed that you're back into positive karma.  did the admins reset your karma (if they can do that) or is it just a bunch of nice redditors giving karma charity?

Iam Ecka6, I'm caught in the middle of the Unidan shitstorm, AMA!
Hi! I've read the original argument as it was happening and totally stood on your side. (I still have you tagged as crow fighter.) I understand that Unidan was probably right, but he was unable to explain his point well. He behaved like a total jerk, which came as surprise to me as he is usually really nice. I like him for years and RES shows that I gave him [+26] points overall. Then came the Uniban and you took a huge karma beating from his circlejerk. I was sorry and embarassed to see that. I've seen cupcake make a promise to make sure your usability of the site won't be hindered – what happened after that? Did she restore your karma afterall, or? I seriously hope you won't be doxxed and harrased over this anymore. People have been known to get death threats over thing they said on reddit. Anyway, there's no harm in buying you gold as all the money go toward maintaining this site (and 10% to charities we pick, IIRC), so why not show our support that way? I don't regret it. :) Lastly: What have you been doing with that Slovak flag on your cheek? Have you visited my country? :) Good luck and don't give up on reddit!  
Iam Ecka6, I'm caught in the middle of the Unidan shitstorm, AMA!
Soooo....how much Reddit gold do you have now? :-D  
As of right now, three years, four months, and 11 days!  
Sounds like you're getting a golden shower. :-D i'm sorry

Take comfort in the fact that you were right. :) Jackdaw: Corvus monedula. Like all true crows in the Family Corvidae. "Corvus blahblahblah"  The bluejay is called Cyanocitta cristata, family Corvidae.  
:D haha  
So, can you be the new Unidan?

Apparently people did get some of my details and posted them on Reddit but got banned. I don't really care because I haven't been very secretive about who I am on the internet. Unless some loon wants to come and kill me!

I just caught a co-worker licking the inside of a drinking cup I just threw away. This is not the first time I've caught her doing something like this. AMA.
I have several questions, but they're all for your coworker.    
Maybe she'll show up. She is a redditor but I've never seen her on this sub. Assuredly this will occur.  
You know her reddit name?

 This is not the first time I've caught her doing something like this.  Please expand on this portion.  
The first time I saw her smelling my chair. When she heard me coming she said that she dropped a quarter and it rolled under my desk. I never saw any coins.  The second time I walked over to the director's office and I saw her from the glass partition smelling a pencil I was wearing behind my ear. She doesn't know I saw her. It didn't smell like anything to me. Periodically I feel my trash has been dug through but I haven't actually seen her do it.  
This is just a little bit creepy. You should touch and use a lot of stuff around her and then covertly document these events for potential legal use later, but mostly for posting for our amusement.  
Yeah she's a little weird I'd say. I have a meeting in 15 minutes I'm going to ask a co-worker to keep and eye on my desk to see what happens.

This has to make it to /r/all... I need answers from the coworker.

Does your SO know about this cup licking, seat smelling deviant? You know, just in case you don't come home one day and they find a smiley face picture on their car?  
No I don't really talk about work with her, but I should probably write it down somewhere.  
So- you might want to give your SO a heads up - "Hey, just in case someone contacts you, I have a coworker who appears to have a bit of a creepy thing for me. I am not interested and will shut this down as soon as possible"   
Yeah, definitely going to make that clear tomorrow with the work girl since I am an idiot and couldn't get it out in the elevator.  
No I don't really talk about work with her, but I should probably write it down somewhere.  
You should probably tell her though.  
After our conversation I just posted I'll probably mention it after tomorrow. I don't want to get my wife all paranoid at this point because god if I go to the store and a cashier even smiles at me I get a dirty look...

What kind of job is this were outwardly weird people working there, has become normal? Also you should bring some strongly scented Clorox wipes to work and wipe down everything in your cubicle, and whenever you use something, before you put it back/throw away, wipe it down just to see what she does or how she responds. It would be so awesome if she watched you, while a single tear of total devastation rolled down her cheek.  
 What kind of job is this were outwardly weird people working there, has become normal?   I work corporate for an international company so there are a lot of different kinds of people in and out here. We also do a lot of government work so... there's that. It's kind of a mix of high paid CFO types all the way down to temp workers out of rehab doing cold-calls. She works as an administrative assistant.  Also you should bring some strongly scented Clorox wipes to work and wipe down everything in your cubicle  Actually this is a better idea than leaving the gross drink cups around. I'm actually going to do this tomorrow. Man I don't know why but until this comment I wasn't really grossed out. I kind of don't want to touch my mouse now. ...and I just saw her walk across the hall so I guess I better get hyped to talk to her soon...

Just posted a small update. I wouldn't say she was flirting with me but she was a bit too happy that I agreed to talk tomorrow. FML.

Also wipe it down directly after she touches anything, even if it's in front of her, so she knows quite clearly that you're not interested in being in contact with her DNA, either. If she asks, you can just claim to be a germ freak.

She wants the D NA.  
I doubt it. Unless she has a fetish for fat neckbeards. I do shower regularly which puts me at an advantage over much of this office though.  
She's very obviously enamored with you. Weird as hell, but drawn to you, none-the-less. Face it, brah. You make her liver quiver. You need only decide if you're into her level of 'interesting' and desire to step things up, or if you prefer to let her bizarre desires go unrequited. But, hey, life is short and crazy can be fun. Of course, it can leave you shattered and shivering, alone in a filthy bathtub, too...  
Well not to ruin fantasy but even though things are on the rocks with my wife I wouldn't go behind her like that. I still respect her.

You should throw away a sock, then leave. Then see if the sock is missing.

Put something in the cup that would be gross/unpleasant to lick but not harmful to her.  And get up from your desk again and see what happens.       And then report back what happens.      Have you considered the possibility that she likes you and just has a weird fetish about you?    Or maybe she's trying to collect your DNA to make a clone of you.

Is she ugly?  
She's attractive to my personal tastes, but I think the internet would say she's a 5/10. 110lb and very long brown hair. I don't really know anything about her outside of work.  
Have you considered going balls to the wall and just straight up asking her why she does all the things she does?  
Yeah, but I'm beta as fuck and don't really want to start confrontation. Plus with with my luck I'll be the one to get shit on by HR.

Boris. BORIS. DO NOT FORGET TO UPDATE US TOMORROW. This saga gives my life meaning. I love you, please don't let me down. Licks your steering wheel  
I just caught a co-worker licking the inside of a drinking cup I just threw away. This is not the first time I've caught her doing something like this. AMA.
Okay, a few things for Boris: Congrats on the raise dude! Although I think maybe cup licker brought up your name to the CFO because she wanted to work with you more. I really think that she is just playing a game maybe. She's probably a little bit attracted to you but with the winking and leaving more notes...I think she wants to freak you out. My theory is she's bored at work and wants to mess with someone. Not exactly mature but whatever. You should tell HR, or even the CFO, that you don't feel comfortable working near her. She touches your stuff, leaves odd notes, and winks at you, and then even licked a cup you had drunk from. That's more than enough grounds.   
If it were just winking and maybe notes, I might agree with the game theory, that she's just messing with him. But licking a cup from the trash and smelling his chair? Nah, that's creepy stalker right there.  Also, the dressing up and makeup today...my bet is on crazy, inappropriate crush. Inappropriate office behaviour either way, though. Glad OP went to HR.

She has a crush on you. It's kinda obvious from everything you've said. You also said in the comments that you don't think that's the case because of how you look. Which is bizarre. You don't see fat dudes out on the streets with girlfriends? People are attracted to a lot of varied things. So, yeah, she likes you. It doesn't sound like she wants to kill you.

When a mother rhino "introduced" her calf to us. She kinda nosed the little toot over towards the gate and stood right next to her as she checked us out.

There's a small amount of people around who think it's a wise idea to adopt wild animals - usually wolves, or big cats.  From experience, which wild animal (that's a common enough purchase by exotic pet owners) is the absolute dumbest to bring into your home? I once met one woman who had a wolf. The poor guy was on a muzzle all day, because he just ate all the furniture whenever he was set free. I'm guessing there was just no possible way for her to exercise the wolf enough to not constantly be pent up with energy.  
IMO big cats are the worst idea to have as pets. Hell, house cats are assholes, now make that asshole a couple of hundred pounds with claws the size of your pinky. No thanks.  
What do you think of the more recently noticed practice (to me at least) of adopting raccoons, and foxes and keeping them as house pets? The videos of these little creatures always excites me and makes me think "I need a raccoon!" but in reality I'm sure I'd rather not have one as pet.   
There was a TV show in Japan about raccoons that spurred a huge wave of people getting them as pets. They soon realized that they make horrible pets and now there are wild raccoons all over Japan.

Not OP but I was a zookeeper for 3 years who worked with both of those, and I wouldn't want either as a pet. I'm going to be generalizing here of course; obviously every individual animal is different. Don't get me wrong, I love foxes and reds are my favorite animal, but they're incredibly smelly, hyperactive, insanely curious/intelligent and require lots of mental stimulation, will chew up furniture, dig up plants, dig up holes all over the yard, don't always handle being leashed well, require a specialized diet (as in you can't just feed them dog food and be done with it) etc. As far as exotics go they're not too bad but they're absolutely not going to be a pet in the same way a dog or cat would.  Raccoons are also extremely messy (I can't stress this one enough), can get into things they're not supposed to get into (drawers, locks, latches, ice chests, etc), are prone to biting, and are illegal in many cases. In a worst case scenario if your raccoon bites someone they may have to be euthanized to determine if they have rabies, even if they were vaccinated for it. They also don't do well in small spaces for more than short periods of time so if you have to crate it you potentially end up with a super pissed raccoon. In both cases it's going to be hard/expensive to find a vet who will treat them, they're illegal in some places, and both require specialized diets. They're cute, but they do much better in the wild than as pets.

What's the best part of the job, and what's the worst?  
That's a tough question to answer. There are so many aspects to the work that what you may love one day, you'll hate the next. I guess seeing little kids get really excited about seeing their favorite animals is what I like the most. Entitled people thinking that their admission ticket allows them to do "whatever the fuck I want to" make me think I'll be on the evening news at some point.  
Interesting that the most annoying animal you have to deal with as a zookeeper are humans.  
I was a Scout leader for my son's troop and I can tell you by far the worst animals in the world are pre-teen humans.

From my time working at theme parks it seems like foreign tour groups are especially entitled. Have you had the same experience?  
In Texas during Holy Week (the week leading up to Easter) we receive a lot of Mexican nationals. These are usually upper-class families and they expect subservience from anyone they encounter. I hated Holy Week.

Are there any animals who's behaviour shocks you? Ever had any dangerous moments?  
I've been doing this long enough that I've seen a lot of weird behavior, so I don't know how to answer that. I'll think about it and come back. Dangerous situations are the norm when working with animals and quickly become "just another day" events. The closest I've ever come to mortal injury was when a rhino bull broke out of his crate during a shipment.  
I imagine that went something like this...

What school did you go to to become one? Is there some sort of education you need? Also, is the job worth it? I mean, can one live off it well?  
I have a BS in Wildlife Ecology from a state university. This is usually enough to get your foot in the door as a full time keeper. You can live off the pay, sure. Well? That depends on your definition of "well".  
I hate how much education you need to work at a zoo or aquarium but the pay is well...  
Some zoos don't require any degree. You won't make as much probably, and it's a competitive field.

Since you're on reddit I'm going to assume you also have a cat. Are there any cool big cat zookeeper tricks I can adapt for my kitty? I used to think frozen ice cubes of blood and meat (adapted to be sous vide chicken in broth) would be cool until I read about how ice cubes are bad for cat teeth.  
We gave ice/blood blocks all the time and I never once saw a cat bite the ice. They treated them like really tasty, cold rocks.

My girlfriend doesn't want to visit zoos because she thinks it's cruel to keep wild animals in cages only so humans can view them. I argued that some of these animals are there because they would not have a chance of survival in the wild (birth defect, irresponsible previous owner, etc.), but it's clearly not the case for every single one of them. What's your take on this?  
The animals we have in zoos and similar institutions were captive bred (a few exceptions). They would not exist at all were they not "in cages". These animals are their ambassadors to the human world. They are the examples that let us know just how precious the wild population is. Cruel is to let these animals starve to death as their habitat is slowly chewed up by industrialized entities. Cruel is to forget how incredible they are. Cruel is to lose focus on the big picture and let a species evaporate in the wild with no chance of being revived.

I kinda expected this question. All AZA accredited zoos are required to have what is called a "shoot protocol". This delineates when lethal force is allowed and when it is required. Any time a visitor's life is in danger (this is a gross oversimplification) the animal will be shot. If Harambe and the boy were not in the water, the outcome could have been different. The water factor raised the stakes exponentially. I can almost guarantee the staff member that had to take that shot has undergone/is undergoing grief counseling. That is an action no zoo professional looks forward to.

This is a point I've tried to make to friends when they make Harambe jokes/link memes. Imagine something like your dog bit someone, through no real fault of their own, but had to be put down. Then people make fun of it to no end. That'd be soul crushing, for me at least.

Leatherman (or other multi-tool), linesman's pliers, two-way radio, belt knife, sunglasses, water bottle. There's lots of other stuff we'll carry depending on which animals we're working with that day, but that's a pretty good list.  
Lets see knife, tool that can cut, radio to call for help, knife, sunglasses to look cool when not needing help and water. Sounds close to what I would keep on me while working with things that want to eat me or when visiting Australia.

Odd question, but here I go. I've volunteered as a keeper aide at my local zoo, and I swear the animals treated me differently when I was on my period. Do you/your coworkers (if you aren't female) have any experience with this? Our male lion scared the shit out of me when he jumped onto the bars of his indoor enclosure and roared at me as soon as I walked by him one of those weeks.   
This is eerily true. Women I have worked with begged off working carnivores when Aunt Flo was in town.

My little brother has Down syndrome and when he was little, I used to take him to the zoo quite a bit (I'm 14 years older than him and this has kind of always been our thing). EVERY time we've been, I've noticed certain animals  will come to the window or closer to the viewing area almost as if they are communicating with him. This includes a gorgeous white tiger that stretched its body on the glass and pawed at us for a very long time. My question is: Based on your education and firsthand experience with animals, do you think they have a special sense about these things?? I've always wondered if I've made the whole thing up and would love a processional's take on it.  
We, as humans, have decided that the only way to communicate is how we do. This is hubris. Animals interact on an instinctual level that we don't get. It could be that the tiger was seeing something in your brother that we wouldn't. Please take this next statement with a grain of salt; predators also see weakness. I don't know you or your brother, but the tiger seems to. Examine exactly what it is that he does when he sees your brother. He may not be as friendly as you hope. I pray I'm wrong.  
Oh shit, that cant be the answer they wanted.

What is your criteria for a worthy zoo? We have two here in my city. One that is typically expensive and houses only animals that thrive in our climate. The exhibits are all clearly well maintained and designed. The animals always seem very content.  The other runs on donations (suggested is $5 a person, plus grants and patrons and so forth). The animals are "typical" zoo animals--lions, tiger, gorillas, giraffes, polar bears, etc that do not live anywhere near our climate usually. The outdoor enclosures are quite small, for instance the three seals have one circular water track about 10 feet deep, 8 feet wide with some rocks and ledges in the middle, and maybe 200 feet around. Most of the animals need to be kept inside for half the year because the weather is so unseasonal for them. Most were rescued or bred into captivity but most also do not look happy. They seem bored and lethargic much of the time, no matter what time of day we've gone.  I really go back and forth about whether to patronize the latter zoo at all. It makes me very uncomfortable to see the animals seem so depressed. At the same time, I know the keepers care for them and I know they couldn't live in the wild. And it's the only place within driving distance kids can see these animals in person, which I know can be helpful in raising awareness for conservation efforts and so forth.  What are your thoughts on zoos like these?   
ONLY go to zoos that are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They are the leaders in conservation, education, animal care and animal welfare. There are lots of "zoos" and wildlife parks that are registered with the USDA, but these are not highly regulated like AZA zoos. Please make sure you are spending money and time at institutions that promote research and conservation all over the world. Joe Bob's Alligator Farm is probably not accredited.

I have spent a few months trying to decide what I want to do with my life, and I realize that zookeeping isn't a super lucrative career and I'd rather do something I love and carve out a modest life than make bank doing something I hate. My desired area would be working with reptiles and aquatic species and I was curious if that'd put me ahead of behind other people who are more interested in working with mammals (also, I've been kinda hoping for one of these for a while now)

My dad used to be an animal trainer and zookeeper for many, many years, and he's always got stories about getting injured on the job, so I've naturally got to ask, what's the worst animal-related injury you've ever gotten?

Thanks for doing the AMA! A few months ago my girlfriend and I went to the zoo and a baby orangutan and his mother were actively looking at us (we were right up to the glass) and putting their hands up to ours (mainly the mom though). We were really fascinated by how the mom seemed to love jewelry and shiny things.  My question being is it normal for primates to show this kind of calm interest in people and their things, or were we just fortunate enough to catch them at a good time?

If you could... which extinct animal would you wanna have at the zoo?

Are you allowed to pet the animals? Have you pet the ones that you don't think will take your arm off?  I wouldn't be able to work in a zoo. I'd spend all my time trying to get them to cuddle with me.

Besides working directly with them, what are your favorite animals to visit and watch at the zoo?

Do the primates in zoos have parasites in their hair/on their skin? On one hand, cleaning parasites off of each other is a special bonding time for primates, but I can also see why skin parasites wouldn't be welcomed in a zoo environment. I saw two monkeys cleaning each other in the San Diego zoo once and I wondered if they were finding anything or just doing it out of instinct.

I'm going for a Bachelors in Biology now to become a zookeeper after several years as a veterinary technician. How much experience did you have before starting, and how difficult was it to find a job? What are your hours like?

Hey man, My opinion is that you guys are doing a great job and that you are doing everything you can to keep the animals happy and healthy! My question might be off but what is your opinion on animal activists that dislikes keeping the wildlife animals in zoo's?  Have you had any experiences or issues with activist trying to break free animals? Have a nice day!

Is there a reason behind why zoo's move gorillas to other zoo's more than other animals? Just a casual observation, not based on any specific data.

Hi there! My brother's dream has always been to be a zookeeper, but doesn't know where to start.  I have a few questions, feel free to answer some and disregard others. How can he get into zoo keeping? What do your daily tasks consist of? Do you need any schooling? How is the pay? Do you ever feel like doing anything else besides zoo keeping? Thank you so much for this ama!    
To get into zookeeping, start applying at zoos. This sounds kinda lame, but it will give you an idea of what zoos look for in candidates. Everyday tasks were always cleaning, feeding and prepping diets. Other than that, we did just about everything. I have learned carpentry, electrical work, plumbing, welding, landscaping, masonry, public speaking, journal writing, chemistry, pharmacology, natural history, and tons of other things in my daily duties as a keeper. In short, there's not much we don't do.  Most keepers these days have some sort of degree beyond secondary school. The pay is not great, but we don't do this to get rich. If I ever did anything else, I would want it to involve environmental education and/or writing.  
Would you say that in a doomsday scenario a zookeeper would be a very good person to have in your group of survivors?  
Ding, ding, ding, wake the kiddies and call the neighbors, we have a winner! Yes, absolutely, if they were a good keeper. Some keepers just want to play with the pretty animals, but they don't usually last very long. Most keepers have had to McGyver something together from time to time, usually to keep themselves or an animal safe or alive.

I was once drinking a bottle of Pink Lemonade on a balcony overlooking a chimpanzee enclosure.  One of the larger chimps approached the balcony and beckoned for my drink.  I pointed at my drink and it nodded at me and thrust it's hand out again.  I declined to throw it down to him and he threw his hands up turned around and walked away. My question is this:  Should I have given the chimp my lemonade?  I'm certain I would have been removed from the zoo.. but damn it.. I was having a conversation with a wild animal and felt he deserved the reward for the effort. Also - have you ever seen the movie Fierce Creatures?  It's wonderful.  
In the grand scheme of things, giving the chimp the lemonade probably wouldn't have been the end of the world. Hell, I'd probably have done it. Odds are, that chimp knew exactly what he was doing and knew his chances weren't great. Fierce Creatures is easily one of my favorite movies. I watch it pretty often, especially if I hear, "I've never seen Fierce Creatures." Instant screening.  
I've never seen Fierce Creatures.

tell the story about the escaped lemurs! i once was at the zoo in my town, and witnessed a couple of lemurs jump out of their pit. so i ran to my wife and  told her. she replied:" do you really think animals can escape in zoo....tsss" so i want to prove it to her  
Animals get out a lot. It's usually just into a service area but occasionally they make it into the public areas. In all fairness it's not that big of a deal usually unless it's a dangerous animal, we usually just lure the animal back in with food treats. We did have a grizzly bear escape when I was still pretty new. That was a gut-wrencher. All the public had to be rounded up and locked in safe areas until the bear was captured. One visitor refused to go inside because he wanted to film the bear. Security ended up pepper spraying him (I was told) to get him to move. At one point he was apparently only about 12-15 feet away from the bear.  Edit: I wanted to clarify; when I say "animals get out a lot" I meant that it happens often enough that keepers don't usually freak out about it.  
[deleted]  
Nah. The bear had eaten a 5 lb. jar of peanut butter prior to escaping. She wouldn't have eaten him, just played with him til he didn't move anymore.

Anytime. One thing you'll discover if you meet a zookeeper IRL is that we love to talk about our jobs. We don't get paid for shit, so we take compensation in free drinks for stories told.

Rhinos are hands-down my specialty animal. They have way more personality than most people think and the fact that something so friggin' huge usually just wants its belly rubbed is fun. I also enjoy most any kind of hoofed animal. They don't get a lot of love b/c they're "boring", but they're just really subtle.   
 They have way more personality than most people think  I live on a farm with cows/calves, and it's only when you interact with them on a daily basis that you realise how unique they are. They all have their own personalities, likes and dislikes.  
I've read that cows are some of the only animals that have friends. I can't remember where I read it, but I've also been told by my mom's fiancee that when he had cows, "All the asshole cows would go off together and the nice ones would stay together"

I figured out a long time ago big hoofed animals sometimes need small pets.  Yes, a horse will sometimes have his own personal dog. Calms the horse down.  
We had, at the zoo, a goat that would travel with some of our more nervous antelope species when they shipped. He was a trailer buddy and it worked really well.

How much interaction can you have with a rhino?  Is standing in their enclosure with them "no big deal" or do you have similar safety guards like for the bears?

How long did it take you to train the monkeys to masturbate at tourists?  
No training needed! They seem to do this naturally. They will also wait to have sex until there is an audience.  
TIL that monkeys are natural exhibitionists.  
Well what would you do if you spent your life locked up in one place with people staring at you all day?

Up next on dreams I didn't know I had but will never accomplish..  
If there is a zoo near you, just volunteer. A good zoo volunteer is worth his/her weight in gold and often gets to do almost everything a keeper does. We had one volunteer that taught the black rhino bull to paint with his lip.

Do the animals really sleep that much or am I just going at the wrong times?  
The animals sleep that much. Think about your cat (you're on reddit so I know you have one). That thing sleeps constantly, right? The big cats are just larger, lazier versions. Other animals sleep a lot during the day simply because that's their biology. To see more active animals, go during cooler parts of the year or in the early morning or evening.  
Do you ever give the big cats catnip?  
Yes, among other things. This falls under the category of "enrichment". We would do all sorts of stuff to get the cats active. The lions loved yellow mustard and Vap-o-rub of all things. At one point, we had a goat that was a companion animal for some of our nervous hoofstock and we would walk him through the lion and tiger exhibits while we cleaned them so he could pee/poop in them. When the cats came out, they went nuts looking for the goat that they knew had to be there somewhere.  
Do you ever give the big cats catnip?  
You just reminded me of the big cat rescue that gives the cats pumpkins.  Half an hour before work ends. I can watch at least two videos in that amount of time... https://www.google.com/search?q=big+cat+pumpkins&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS643US643&oq=big+cat+pumpkins&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.3103j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8

What's the most dangerous situation that you've ever been in? Did anyone get hurt in that situation?  
We were transporting an anesthetized tiger to the vet clinic for some routine exams when he "woke up" in the van. He opened his eyes, lifted his head, and placed his mouth around a keeper's leg. No one was injured but pants were shat. The worst I've ever gotten was a torn up knee during a bison immobilization.  
I probably would have had a heart attack and died if a tiger put my leg in it's mouth.  An unlikely situation, since I sort of avoid zoos because of the tigers. They're one of my biggest phobias. Any advice on how to get over the phobia?  
Volunteer at a zoo and try to work in areas with animals that freak you out. After about a week of being scared shitless, you just kinda stop freaking out and just start treating it like a job. My first time working the big cats by myself, I was a nervous wreck. After about 2 weeks of having lions and tigers roar at you while you feed them and move them around, it just kinda becomes noise.

Slowly desentisize yourself. Do this by looking at pictures of tigers at first then build up to going to a zoo and looking at them from far away and then move closer. Something along those lines.  I am not a Doctor or a Psychiatrist.

Has there been any "deaths" at your zoo? Like humans falling into enclosures or animals passing away?  
Animals pass away all the time, it's one of the shittier aspects to the job. I've never been involved directly with any human fatalities, but they do happen. Elephants are one of the more dangerous animals to work with b/c they are so damn intelligent. If an elephant decides it wants you dead, you're pretty well screwed. Visitors fall into enclosures occasionally, but usually it just freaks the animal out and they go hide while the visitor gets fished out.

Has an animal ever escaped and gotten away never to be found again?  
I worked in one wildlife park early in my career that had a hole cut in its perimeter fence by a local psycho. We lost a few deer and ibex through the fence, never to be seen again. I was told by a local years later that they had been quickly hunted by the neighbors.  
For some reason, I can just imagine a redneck looking at the ibex he killed going, "Carl, why do you think this deer looks weird?"  
Most of the rednecks in this area were pretty accustomed to exotic hoofstock. It's a pretty big industry in that part of the US.

Favorite animal/ story of what happened during your time?  
There are a ton, but the one that pops to mind right now is when a bull rhino broke out of his shipping crate as we were getting ready to send him to another zoo. He poked a hole in the wall with his horn and just proceeded to demolish the crate. We had to custom build a solid steel crate for him in the end.  
I'm guessing that went from a $500 crate to a $5,000 crate!

What animals are surprisingly laid-back, and which animals are surprisingly assholes?  
The rhinos are really laid back. Most people expect them to be aggressive and short-tempered, but if you have time to give belly rubs and scratches, they are your best friends. The asshole animal I was most surprised by was a Goodfellow's tree kangaroo. The females we had were super laid back and easy to work with. The male? Well let's just say he was so mean he would chew on his own testicles to get himself worked up before he came after us.  
Huh, he must be a blast at parties.  
He was an evil, evil animal. He also beat the shit out of the females which made him pretty much worthless.

has an animal ever bit  you?  if so, did u bite back?  
I've been bitten, kicked, run over, sat on, pissed on, etc. so many times I wouldn't know where to start. And I've only bitten an animal once and that was my own dog when he was playing too rough.  
Which animals did each of these? I'm most curious about the sitting.  
Bitten: sika deer, maned wolf, bush dog, red kangaroo, ostrich, emu, rhea, sand cat, fennec fox  Kicked: zebra, elk, red deer, wildebeest, rhino, giraffe (grazed), gemsbok, sable, roan, bison, emu, red kangaroo, wallaby, gazelles of all sorts Run over: basically every hoofed animal I've ever worked with Sat on: bison, kangaroos, ostrich, emu Pissed on: rhino, elephant, lion, tiger, too many birds too count I'm sure there are more, these are just the ones I can think of off of the top of my head.

Coolest display of animal intelligence you've seen?  
I'm sure there are tons of examples with primates and some bird species, but since I don't work a lot with them, I have to say that warthogs (and other wild pig species) have impressed me the most. I watched a male warthog figure out how to disarm an electric fence so he could get to part of his exhibit where we were trying to establish new plants. He used his tusk (which doesn't conduct electricity) to pull the fence down and short it out.  
Not a zoo story but when I was a kid living in the middle of nowhere in Scotland, my parents decided to get a pair of pigs to eventually get slaughtered for meat. They had a roofed enclosure but my parents decided to section off part of the garden with an electric fence so the pigs could also enjoy being outside. The first few times one of the pigs touched the fence, it took off like a bat out of hell. Unfortunately, it took off forwards, charging straight through the fence and wrenching the lightweight metal posts out of the ground and the connections loose. After setting it all back up each time, the Pigs eventual learnt not to touch it and all was good for a while.  Until, one day, we discovered the pigs in the strawberry plot. Expecting to find the electric fence once again in tatters we guided them back to their pen only to discover it apparently intact. Bemused at how they had escaped, we put them back in.  They managed to escape several more times, always when no-one was watching until we eventually caught them in the act.  To provide them a little shelter we'd placed a wooden pallet in the corner of their pen slanted at an angle, where the wall on one side met the electric fence on another. The Houdini pigs were backing off to get a good run at it and then charging up the wooden pallet before matrix style wall running over the fence to land on the grass at the other side. TL; DR; Houdini pigs wall run over electric fence.

Are the animals happy?  
Thank you for asking this. This question does not have a simple answer, so I will try to talk through it some. I can say beyond a doubt that the animals in "good" zoos receive excellent care (I put good in quotes because there's always a shitty version of something). I would also feel comfortable saying that keepers make it a point to keep their animals as content as possible, partly because we love our animals, also, it's easier to work with a calm animal than an agitated one. There are always individuals that do not adapt to their surroundings. We work very hard to make sure these instances are few and far between, but the simple fact is, there is no way to be 100% successful in the animal care field. You do the best you can and learn from your (and others') mistakes. I would finish by saying I am certain I would not have done this for so long had I thought the animals were not happy, I don't think I could take it.

What's the worst thing that a visitor has done (feeding the animals something poisonous to their system etc) and what came of it?  
The first time our black rhino female was pregnant, someone dropped a full bottle of Vicodin in her enclosure. She ate the whole thing. We had no idea what effect it would have on here or the calf. Fortunately, both were fine.  
Was the bottle dropped by accident or with malicious intent?

In your professional opinion, what animal would be the hardest to fight if you had to fight 100 duck-sized versions of them?  
Orang-utan. Smart, strong, and even the duck-sized versions could tear off your arm.  
Why is Orang-utan sometimes spelled with a hyphen, and often not?  Which is correct? What's the difference between the two?   
it's actually made up of two words, 'orang' meaning 'person' and 'hutan' meaning forest (Malay and Indonesian origin). I believe the hyphen is just a matter of preference; most common spelling is 'orangutan' :)

When's the best time to go to the zoo/see the most out of the animals?  
Dusk or dawn (or as close as you can get to it). Animals are always more active around these times. They spend most of the daylight hours sleeping. It's also around these times (early and late) that a lot of animals get fed.

Any co-workers with animal fetishes, or caught in compromising situations? Also, what's one animal you never want to deal with again?  
I've never heard of any sort of compromising situations. Doesn't mean they don't happen, but if they do I've gotta think it's exceedingly rare. If I never work with spotted hyenas again, I'll be okay with that. They were one of two animals (the other being a jaguar) that ever looked at me and made me feel like food.  
We had an incident in my hometown pittsburgh zoo with the spotted dogs. A kid fell in the enclosure around feeding time. Well, you can guess what happend.

So most of the big cats were just big cats?  
Exactly. This is why people think they would make good pets. That's not entirely false, but think of your cat (once again, you're on reddit, I know you have one), most of the time your cat's a relatively placid creature, content to sleep and tolerate your brief attention. Every now and then, that cat spazzes out and claws/bites/kicks for no real reason. With a house cat, no big deal. With a 500 lb. lion? Big deal. Ask Roy Horn.

What's the most dangerous situation you or one of your coworkers have ever been in while working there?  
That's a tough question. We did/do things of questionable safety as a matter of course. The rhino breaking out of his crate was probably the most danger I've ever been in. As he was tearing the crate apart, shards of wood were flying everywhere. I watched a video of it later and saw multiple wooden missiles pass within inches of my face. I didn't realize it at the time b/c I was so focused on the rhino. Edit: I just remembered a procedure we did on a wildebeest once in the field. We had darted a bull to move him to a different area and as our vet was checking his vitals, the bull kicked, missing the vet's head by about a cm. The vet never even noticed because he was listening to the stethoscope, but he damn near died.   
Jeez, that's crazy. Definitely sounds like you don't have a boring job.

What is the story with the lemur escape mentioned in the original post  
The ring-tailed lemurs were exhibited on a fake island. They were kept on the island primarily by an electric fence. At one point the fence shorted out and no one realized except the lemurs. Three of the 8 or so on exhibit jumped the moat and climbed the back of the service area into some trees. We spent most of our time waiting for the public to kind of "clear out" of the area so we could dart the little bastards (lemurs, not public). Once they were darted and drugged, we just picked them up and put them back in their indoor holding area til the exhibit was fixed. All in all pretty boring, but at the time our curator was losing his mind.  
I bet sometimes you just want to dart the public, don't you?

Which of the 'lesser loved' animals do you think deserves more attention, and why?  
The babirussa. Ugly, endangered and not too common in zoos. Also crazy smart and usually love their keepers. The ones I worked with could be put asleep by scratching between their front legs.   
I've been a zookeeper for the better part of 14 years. AMA.
I actually posted a request for someone like you to do an AMA when I was writing my play last year: I still have some questions!! 1: do you build significant relationships with any of the animals? 2: have you ever been caught in a tricky situation in any enclosures? 3: what is the most rewarding part of your job? Thank you for doing the AMA, I'd be happy to send you a draft too if you like!

I'm about to graduate with a degree in animal science. I have hands on experience with exotics, horses, and I was a full time dog trainer. I want to handle and eventually move on to conservation work. Am I headed in the right direction? I admit that I don't know how selective a zoological park would be.

I'm both intrigued and completely disgusted by hyenas. Everything about them seems to be in stark contrast with how other animals have evolved. Their social structure and their mating habits, even their physical attributes (long front legs). Everything about them seems so backwards and like....a strange mutation that shouldn't have taken hold, but it did. My question to you is, do you interact with them at all? If so, do they act like dogs? I love animals oh so much but these ones I just get completely freaked out about. How are their behaviors around a human that they know?

I'm so glad you and your mother are on the verge of patching things up.  Good for you!! How will you deal with your brother?  
I don't know. I thought, through all this, he was the last one who was still sort of there for me. To find out it was the complete opposite was just so much to take. I wanted to call him and yell and scream but if I do that I might ruin this.

I can't fully relate but my dad was lying about his income for many years as I helped him with bills.  I still don't know where his money went. That doesn't matter but after all of it that was just time to accept that you were wrong. The worst thing to do is be hard on yourself or not trust other people. I know people in the world can be cruel and it's worse when it's your family (my issue wasn't just with him) but the thing is most people are good.  They really are.  I hope you and everyone do make up but if nothing else that you forgive them.  The reason I say that is for you not them.  You didn't deserve any of that but you also don't deserve to feel angry or upset.  It's not healthy.  Much love your way man.  I'm proud you told someone because bottling it up only makes it worse. Even if it's just reddit.  I speak from experience.   
You sound like a very wonderful (and wise) person. I hope good things come your way.

Ok so I know we didn't go through even close to the same thing but I did have a very racist, controlling, uncaring and assholeish father. He died about 3 months ago now. My relationship with my parents was not very good to say the least for the past few years. I was always the black sheep for various reasons. Anyway to make a long story short, my mother who used to defend everything about my father now truly realizes how much of a dick he was. She is a wonderful grandmother to my 3 year old and feels horrible that most of my childhood memories were tarnished by such a complete turd burgler. Things will work out with your mom and sister. They probably now have realized that your dad was a dick and want to be a family more than memorialize that dingleberry. Now your brother...punch his lying sadistic ass in the throat.  
I'm more stunned by the truth, he was unfaithful and rather than face it he committed suicide. It seems, to me, that was the true testament of my father's person. He was, and it hurts me to say this about my own father, a weak, weak man. My mother hasn't explicitly said she regrets him, but in the way she wasn't standoffish and wasn't against meeting my children, if anything she asked to do it. As for my brother, I don't know if I can forgive him. Ever.

have you asked your brother about keeping this from you?  
I haven't called him. He's on my list of people I have no idea what to do with. But believe me, if I could wring his neck right now, I would.  
No, no, no. I understand your frustration and disappointment with your brother.   Do not start another family feud.   Simply thank him for giving you mom's number. Tell him that she's coming to visit and you are looking forward to mending the delicate fabric of this family that has been torn.  Tell him about the weight that has lifted from shoulders now that you know the truth behind Dad's suicide via your mom. Let him know that you hope, in the future, he feels free to unburden family secrets. Maybe your brother was keeping this factoid a secret to hide the shame of what your dad did, how your mother hurt and maybe he also felt betrayed; unfortunately at your expense.   Don't wring his neck, be the wonderful person that you are. Be empathetic.   Good luck.

This really got to me. I really love happy or bittersweet endings/new beginnings. We don't choose our parents. They make mistakes, sometimes big ones, sometimes unforgivable ones. As they get older sometimes they get haunted by them.  I hope your mother is sincere and I hope everything works out for your family. Family can be the greatest gift or the heaviest burden, but it's always there in the back of our minds even if we don't speak for decades. Peace and love is so much better for everyone. You've been through a lot but maybe it will all pay off in the end. I wish you all the best.

Woah.  That's a lot for you to process.  A lot of it is good, but it is awful that they let you think your father blamed you for his suicide.  I hope reuniting with them is healing for you and a positive experience for your wife and children.  
Yeah, I'm not going to lie my wife and I are nervous as to how this will play out, but we're in it together to try.  
It does seem worth trying, your mom sounds like she's changed.  But I still wouldn't leave her alone with the kids for quite some time.  :/

Idk man, it's good I guess if you want to reconnect but if I remember correctly your family are a bunch of racist biggots, if that's the case, they wouldn't be worth my time if I was you. You never have an obligation to your family, I don't love my mother because I came out of her vagina, I love my mother because she's been there for me for 22 years and I know she is there for me if I need her.  If they've changed, great, if not, don't be guilted ( by them or yourself ) to do anything you don't have to.   
Yeah, I was clear with my mother that her old attitude is not accepted in my house, near my family, and especially near my kids. I won't have it. I don't feel guilted per se , I feel like it's a good chance to move on and grow together. If she can't, we'll know.

This post does seem a bit iffy to me. The OP put a lot of detail into the emotionality of every tiny event, which isn't really how people normally recount things. This honestly reads like a fictional story to me.   
It's fresh to me. Like, really really really fresh. I don't know how else to recount this other than exactly how I remember it. Reading it back it does look like I hired William Faulkner to write it.

How'd his mom see a family photo when they've been completely disconnected for "years"?? Great for op if its real, but it seems unlikely imo

You must not have a lot of extended family you don't see.  Because there's family I haven't seen since I was a child who seem to somehow know everything about my life. It's the internet. It happens.

I was tearing up reading that.  My family has always been a huge part of my life.  I can't imagine the pain of being disowned.  I sincerely hope that you all get along and enjoy each other's company while they are visiting.  I hope you and your mom stay in touch and grow closer than you ever imagined possible. I guess I should ask a question.  Do you plan on telling your kids the truth about why they didn't see their grandma for the first part of their lives?

I cried reading this. I was part of the original thread and I nearly cried reading that to but to see this, I don't have any words. It's beautiful. I'm so happy for you and for your family. I can't say anything more. I'll ask a question since I think I have to even with casual amas. Do you think your mother truly believed in white supremacy in the past or do you think it was your father stringing her along? It's not the first time a mother 'neglected' her child because of the father's wishes after all.

You have any proof of any of this?  I'm sorry, it all sounds sort of made up.  
I'm wondering, how'd his mom see the family pictures?? He said earlier he's been cut off from his family for years, I can't imagine they stayed connected on Facebook  
If they were both friends with the brother that lied to him then she could (assuming low privacy settings)

Wait... you said in the OP that your father's suicide note blamed you for spitting on the grave of his ancestors, and he couldn't tolerate having non-white grandchildren. If he killed himself over an affair, why write all that?

How do you feel about the washington post basically trying to dox you? http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/05/meet-the-unashamed-33-year-old-who-brought-the-stolen-celebrity-nudes-to-the-masses/  
Small world ... I went out on a date with the author of that blog post once.  
Details, girlfriend!  
She was normal enough in person.  The date did go terribly south though, and it wasn't really anyone's fault.  I received a call from my mother during the date, which I immediately picked up because my mom was with my grandmother who was dying of senile dementia.  My grandmother had returned to a lucid state after not being mentally "there" at all for at least a week, and so the last time I talked with her before she died was right in the middle of the date, outside the bar.  As you can imagine, it completely wrecked the mood (I explained what the call was about to her), and neither of us tried to contact the other afterwards. So you got a good story out of me about it, but it's probably not the kind of saucy details about her you were looking for.  But even if there were any I wouldn't divulge them; it's not nice to be mean about someone on the Internet like that, especially when they can't defend themselves.  I've been a target of that kind of stuff enough myself, and wouldn't wish it on anyone.  
Details, girlfriend!  
Yeah, feel free to mention any financial difficulties she might have had so we can judge her off that.  After all, it is the easiest way.

Maybe they mean inaccessible as in "it's hard to understand the content". Personally, I never know what to do or how to look for certain things on 4chan.

I don't like it, but so be it. The Nixon Administration couldn't stop the WP, so I didn't try to stop them. Also, I paid my gas bill in case anyone cares.  
How do you feel about the washington post basically trying to dox you? http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/05/meet-the-unashamed-33-year-old-who-brought-the-stolen-celebrity-nudes-to-the-masses/

That article is pretty terrible. They're basically trying to state as many facts as thinly veiled insults, and the article title leads people who don't actually read it to think that /u/johnsmcjohn is actually the hacker.  Also, acting as if 4chan is "highly inaccessible" is just a lie. Implying that the pictures wouldn't get onto Reddit in the first place is just ridiculous.

Where do you stand on the "Was this leaking event and our viewing of the pictures moral?" debate?  
These pics would be posted regardless. Me and the mod team tried to ensure the content posted was in line with reddit's rules.  
You didn't actually answer your question.  It wasn't whether you "followed the rules", nor whether "someone else would have done it".   The question is where you stand on whether leaking/viewing (and sharing by logical extension) the photos moral in your opinion? Personally I have not looked at the photos because I think it's incredibly fucked up to invade anyone's privacy this way, even though I personally don't think nudity is a big deal.  I personally also don't think "someone else would have done it" is a good reason to do something wrong.

I personally also don't think "someone else would have done it" is a good reason to do something wrong.  
This is a copy/paste from a comment I made on the day after the photos were leaked: I find it fascinating that people aren't a bit pissed off by this.  Sure, we get to see naked pics of people we see on TV, but this was a planned "attack" on these people.  Someone coordinated the hacks and has been selling these pictures to people online.  Isn't that a little bit fucked up? The world is outraged by the NSA and its actions, but nobody gives a shit when someone steals naked pictures and sells them to strangers on the Internet.  Seriously?  You want your own privacy to be secured, but if someone else's privacy is invaded so you can jerk off, that's okay, right?   I know, most of these actresses have shown skin in their movies, but this is totally different.  When someone agrees to be shown naked in a movie, they do it of their own will for the sake of the movie (and money, I suppose).  You can't just say "Well, they've already shown us most of it.  Might as well see the rest".  Most actors/actresses draw a line and this crosses that line.  And now, they have to live with the fact that millions of people have seen those images.  They will have to keep their head held high for PR reasons, but I'm sure that some of them feel incredibly violated.  I know that I would feel violated if someone hacked into my Dropbox account and downloaded my schoolwork, which doesn't even compare to what has happened to these people. And don't even give me that bullshit "She should have protected her data better".  I keep my TV in my living room.  If someone breaks my window and takes my TV, should I have protected my TV better?  Was I at fault for putting my TV in a place that is easy for me to get to?  I locked my windows and doors but someone got to it anyway.  Obviously, things like naked pictures should be kept more secure than a TV.  I'm a tech-savvy guy and I know this.  But to the standard individual, a password is like putting something into a lockbox.  Don't blame the victim when the perp is the one who committed the crime. I'm sorry that I'm piggybacking off of you, but I was getting so annoyed with people on this site. Damn near every post on /r/all mentions "the fappening".  I think it's fucked up that we now have online "communities" to discuss this shit.  I'm a 20 year old guy... and honestly I would have liked to see some revealing images of JLaw or Kate Upton. It's human nature.  But I honestly can't be a part of this.  The damage is done and it doesn't help anything, but I find it sickening that people are okay with what happened.

What was your AMA post in /r/IAMA deleted for?  
/r/IAmA is reserved for people who aren't "Internet Famous". Or are at least famous for a reason other than an identity that Reddit is responsible for.  
Minus that second sentence. Youtubers and bad luck Brian got taken down. I don't think reddit is personally responsible for a meme and youtubers have barely any relation to reddit whatsoever  
What was your AMA post in /r/IAMA deleted for?  
Good question. Ask the mods of /r/IAMA.  
It's barred under rule 8 in the wiki.  Posts about your experiences on the internet are allowed if it can be objectively determined that the activity is a significant portion of your life, using factors such as income received, time devoted to it, uniqueness and level of creativity, and outside attention it gets. Also consider /r/InternetAMA.  I'm sure this will front page anyway.

The female corpses thing is technically legal, and not against reddit's code of conduct.  Plus, corpses can't sue you. Reddit likely got complaints from some powerful-ass motherfuckers for thefappening.

While I understand the idea, my understanding of the admin policy is that they want to enable free speech as far as possible within the extent of the law. Hence why jailbait was banned because of the risk of CP, or how the celeb nudes leak could have potential criminal backdraft, while the sub you linked may not be violating any particular laws. How they got their images I can't say, since there's no way I'm gonna click on that link.  Alternately, they're doing what they can for publicity reasons - the media talked about Jailbait and The Fappening and not about the other stuff, and they want to avoid as much bad publicity as possible.   
Exactly. People who say that reddit is hypocritical for banning /r/thefappening and allowing other much worse subreddits are missing the reason why /r/thefappening was banned in the first place. It wasn't because /r/thefappening was so morally wrong that the admins decided that it had no place on a website like reddit, therefore bringing up morally objectionable subreddits that weren't banned is irrelevant. It was banned because of the legal issues that a sub like /r/thefappening brings. The admins job isn't to be the moral compass for all of reddit, they allow us to create our own subreddits and set our own ground rules for what is morally objectionable. Their job is to keep the site running and to make sure that what other subs consider morally acceptable for them is also legal and not in risk of breaking the site.

I don't see why people are that surprised, reditt is is huge company now and there can be no guarantee for content when addessing pr and legal concerns.

Honestly I don't give a shit about celebrities (or their nudes) so /r/TheFappening wasn't my thing. Was the sub created for a single source / treasure trove of pics that were leaked, or was the idea to get additional sources involved? If there was a single source, the "well would've run dry" so to speak. Would the sub just become irrelevant after awhile?  
I created /r/TheFappening because I liked the name and checked if the sub was up, and when it wasn't, I created it. I fully expected the sub to wane as time went on in popularity. Banning it shocked me. Especially after all the traffic we'd had over the last wee.

Because /r/TheFappening wasn't deleted because the reddit admins are trying to suddenly become reddits moral compass. /r/TheFappening was deleted because it's putting reddit in legal hot water. The blog post was written to make it seem like it's a moral issue, but it's strictly a legal one.  
So basically the difference is whether the victims have money power and influence. Sounds about like the status quo here in America.

The whole fappening thing was a serious moral dilemma for me. While yes I did enjoy the pictures,I  felt bad because I was violating someones privacy.   Anyway, did you feel bad about posting or hosting these photos?  
I didn't post them. I didn't host them. These pics would be posted regardless and I tried to make sure my community was in line with reddit's rules.  
Follow up question, If you didn't want to post  the pictures and apparently pictures in general "don't do it for you" then why did you even create the subreddit,I'm curious?  Also when I meant "host",what I meant was  making a subreddit where you could post pictures not literately host the image sorry if I didn't make that clear.  
I created the sub because I thought "/r/TheFappening" was an awesome subreddit name. When it exploded, I just did what I can to ensure the community stayed in line with Reddit's rules. BTW, I didn't I don't get anything from these pics.

I am a woman who was trapped in a locker for over 60 hours in high school
At any point did you hallucinate? Like hear people outside that weren't there?  
Yes, especially when it was totally dark. I would see things and hear things that weren't there.  
Such as?  
It was weird, it was like having dreams while I was awake. Although I may have been asleep for some of it because when it was so dark and quiet it was hard to know when I had really slept. It is hard to explain this. But mostly I saw and heard people that I know.  
Yes, especially when it was totally dark. I would see things and hear things that weren't there.  
That sounds like it's out of a nightmare or horror movie. What did you hear and see? I'd imagine I'd be a little girl and start crying....I'm a guy.  
Well at least you'd feel safe inside the locker...  
I am a woman who was trapped in a locker for over 60 hours in high school
Man that's intense. I once got locked in a closet when I was 14 for four hours before my cousin came home and got me out. Couldn't use an elevator because of the resulting claustrophobia for about ten years after that.  Did you end up getting teased at school?

can you image if it wasn't just a weekend but like the friday before winter break or something?  
Then I definitely would have died, from what someone else said, humans can live 3-5 days without water. So I could have survived 5 days in there. I shudder to imagine what it would have been like after 5 days.  
I'm sure if that happens the school, your parents or the police will eventually find you, but you would probably have no hope, no certainty that someone will find you, to me that seems a lot more scary than the physical stuff

Ugh. That literally made my heart stop for a second. On the other hand, it makes for kind of a cool story. Girl gets trapped in a locker for days, experiences these crazy hallucinations. During one of these hallucinations, she witnesses a murder. In reality, she really did see a murder but her lucid state made her think otherwise. You know? Maybe?

My claustrophobia was sitting on top of my chest through this entire read, but I have to ask: Why didn't you just tell the teacher the combination to the lock? You must have known it to have opened it in the first place.  
After all that time trapped inside there I wasn't thinking straight anymore. And he didn't really stay long, he didn't even ask if I knew the number and I didn't even think to tell it too him. That was something my boyfriend wanted to know too because his lock was ruined.  
How did the lock get closed after you had shut the door? That's the only thing I don't understand.   
I put the lock on the door, closed the lock and then pulled the door shut, that was just how our lockers worked.

I see. What a traumatic experience, a claustrophobic nightmare. Did you develop claustrophobia after this happened? Mine began after getting myself stuck in a storage compartment of a camper while playing hide and seek as a kid. I wasn't in there for more than 15 minutes before my brother got me out but the fear has remained. My chest tightens just thinking about it.  
Actually no I didn't, see my second to last paragraph in my story. To be honest, this experience developed something else in me, but I am not sure if it is okay to mention adult topics here. You can message me and I can tell you if you'd like to know.

Wait, you were missing for three days and your boyfriend actually cared that his $3 lock was destroyed? I'm sorry but that's ridiculous.   
He may not have made a big deal about it but rather just mentioned "hey I think my lock is jacked." And even if he did make a big deal, which seems ridiculous to presume... It was a high school kid in like 1998. For all I know that lock cost him a days pay at work, idk.

After reading this, this gives me a new perspective on my (once thought) overly involved/overly protective mother. When I was a teen (32 now), there is no way I could have been MIA for 60 hours without anyone really noticing. If I asked or made plans to be at a friends house, she always made me call to check in that afternoon after school with either her or my dad. She even occasionally called during the evening or the next day to see how things were going, though I always thought it was more to check and see if I was still where I said I'd be. Having grown up that way, I just can't imagine the concept of parents not remembering the date of a two night sleep over and not calling when I didn't show up at home.  I mean, I'm not faulting your parents or saying they were bad parents. Just that it's hard for me to imagine it.  After this experience, did they become more over protective and kept closer tabs on you?   
My parents had a lot of trust in me. I always went where I said I was going and was where I was supposed to be when I was supposed to be there. So I don't blame them for not following up on me. They of couse blamed themselves for not knowing that the two day sleep over was still a month away. Afterwards they didn't become more protective, but once the event was far enough in the past my dad would joke with me whenever I left the house and he would tell me to stay out of lockers.

Did you develop a reputation at school?  
Actually, no. They decided for my sake to keep this private. My boyfriend knew and I only told my best friend. To this day there are only a few people from my school that knew what happened to me and why I was really out of school for the entire week.  
That's nice. Saves a big chunk of the dignity what's left after the ordeal. When I was in middle school I fainted and while unconscious apparently vomited on myself. In the front row of an auditorium full of students. Ended up being 2-3 worst years of my life.  
Yeah, that would be horrible. I am glad that I was able to kee my embarassing moment private because I am sure I would have earned some nicknames.

What did you think about in the times you just had to wait?  
Well I constantly reminded myself how dumb what I had done was. I thought about my parents and how upset they would be if I died. I thought about my boyfriend finding me dead in his locker. But on the bright side I did think about good times in my life. Fun family vacations from when I was little.  
Was there any point when you considered giving up or trying to kill yourself while you were trapped?

 Unfortunately for me he didn't need to get anything out of his locker that day because he had done most of his homework during study hall and already had what he needed to take home with him already.  I think the moral here is to procrastinate on your homework.

Okay I think I've read all the questions so I hope I'm not re-asking anything here:  You said in a way you were glad it happened to you, a lot of people can look back on character-building experiences and actually miss them, even though it was awful at the time, do you miss the locker sometimes? Even in a weird small way? Did you feel closer to his locker after that? Do you wonder who has the locker right now and has no idea such an important life experience happened right there in their locker? I'm interested in the story from your parents'/boyfriend's perspective... I imagine it was hard to fall asleep Sunday night while you were missing? What was their reaction when you spoke to them for the first time? Did you tell your parents you loved them like you planned? Did anyone initially stifle a laughter at you when it was all said and done? Do you remember what kind of stuff you were into? Like any specific songs you had stuck in your head, or sang? Or intentional daydreams you had just for fun? Has the locker haunted / helped you in an explicit way since then? Obviously it was character building but anything more specific than that? Or maybe locker nightmares? Do you recommend this experience to anyone else? Haha! How (if at all) has it altered your ultimate perspective on death?  Sorry for all the questions, hope you see them! And thanks! Glad it wasn't worse and we're able to have this conversation!  
 Well, in a way it was a type of adventure. It was difficult to endure, it was painful and the most intense challenge I have had in my life. So in a way, yes, I miss it in that way. Since then I have come to enjoy bondage and I think this situation may have pushed me towards enjoying bondage. After this was all over and I went back to school, I still would meet my boyfriend at his locker on Fridays. I often consider what I had experienced while there waiting for him and there was a weird urge to do it again. But he told me that if he ever didn't see me in the hallway he'd check his locker before leaving just in case I got ideas again. Well, most likly no one has the locker because a new school was built in 2005 and the old one is gone. I don't know if the lockers were demolished with the school, removed and sold or scrapped. I would like to own a locker someday, even if I just use it for storage in the basement. My parents didn't sleep. After the police left they decided to go out looking for me. They mostly drove around all night aimlessly checking public places like parks, hoping that they may just find me safe somewhere. My boyfriend wanted to help look for me, but his parents told him to let the police do their job, he didn't sleep well that night and finally found out what had happened to me the next morning at school. No one laughed at me when I told them what I had done. My mom cried because of what I had to endure. I really liked Boyz II Men at the time and sang some of their songs while in there. I don't remember if a particular song was stuck in my head. My only intentional daydream was of being rescued, lol. It haunted me that I was dumb and careless and I could have seriously harmed or killed myself and broken the hearts of many people. It helped me because it showed me that if I can endure a very difficult situation like that then I can probably handle most other things in life. The only thing more specific would be that it may have been what pushed me to enjoy bondage and that is something fun I can share in with my husband. No locker nightmares, lol. Yes, but only to people who deserve to be punished. Rapist, murders, child molesters, etc. It did teach me to value my life more. That death was something I should avoid with everything in me. As I said in my post I was suicidal at times and that stopped after this event.   
In my short life I've noticed that girls often endure difficult situations much easier than guys from a psychological point of view. Guys lose their shit if they aren't in control.

I can't imagine that happening to me... How did you pass the time? 60 hours is surely not something you can nap through... Or even stay awake, doing nothing.   
I did a lot of thinking when I was awake. And well, since I was already kind of exposed I passed some of the time enjoying myself, if you know what I mean. It was a horrible place to be so I figured I might as well experience some pleasure while in there. I didn't post about that at first because I didn't know if it was appropriate or not, but one user messaged me and asked me about it and said that it should be a problem.  
Man, I don't blame you. Have to do something to pass the time! Also, just a random question, but what movement were you limited to in the locker?  
Well I could bend my knees forward so they pressed on the door and then my butt pushed against the back wall and I'd lean my head on the door. That was my sleeping/resting position. The biggest restriction was my arms. They would get pinned in place at times and it was hard to move them to where I wanted them.

Hehe, that bothered me less than everything else I was going through.

Sorry if this is really dumb, my high school didn't have lockers so im going off of basic gym lockers... but how did you pull the door closed after the lock was already through the hole? I'm not disbelieving your story at all! I'm just confused.   
I am a woman who was trapped in a locker for over 60 hours in high school

Did your boyfriend ever top this prank? Would've been great if he opened the locker   
Lol, a prank worse than me peeing all over the inside of his locker? No, he never topped that. If he had been the one to find me Monday morning I still intended to scare him. I mean after all I went through I should have still had my chance to get him.  
If you had died, while it would have been tragic, you must admit that would have been the ultimate, unbeatable scary prank.

Why don't you wear underwear?  
I found out when I was about 14 how much more comfortable it was. At first I was nervous about it, but about a year later I had given up underwear completely.  
Do you still go commando?  
Yes, I haven't worn underwear for almost 20 years now, I no longer even own any underwear.

Hello, 3 months after you posted this, lol. I'm not on here often and was surprised that there were new comments posted on this.  
I am a woman who was trapped in a locker for over 60 hours in high school
How long did the relationship last after this? Have you ever met anyone that did the same thing? Have you ever been referred to as the hide and seek champion?   FYI, posts don't gain a lot of attention late in the evening US time.  
We stayed together for about another year, this event didn't change anything between us. If anything he became more protective of me. I haven't heard of or met anyone else that this has happened to, I might be the only person. Or at least the only person who has told people about it. Lol, no, but that would be a rough way to win hide and seek. So do you suggest I repost this at some other time? Is that even allowed?  
What was the cause of the breakup?  
We were going away to different colleges. If was something that we had talked about for some time, that if we didn't feel a life long connection, that we would separate when it was time to go to college. I am glad we made that choice because I met my husband in college and wouldn't trade him for anything.

You said you expected to die on Saturday night. To me, one of the most terrifying things to think about is what it would be like to know you were going to die in a short amount of time and that you could do nothing to prevent it. What was that like?

I'm sorry you had to suffer so long, but in all seriousness this needs to get made into a movie or book (a la 127 Hours). I really enjoyed your writing and am glad you made it out okay and with such a positive outlook on life!  
Thank you, I never considered myself much of a writer. I don't know if I'd be able to turn this story into something long enough for an entire book though. It was mostly me doing the same things over and over.  
short story?

Did you start to plan all the things you would do when you got out? If so, what were they? Did you do them?  
I am a woman who was trapped in a locker for over 60 hours in high school
How did you get to the hospital? What did they do for you there? Do you remember what you first ate/drank after getting out?  
They took me to the hospital in an ambulance. They re-hydrated me through an IV, gave me something to help me relax and to help with the pain. They got me out of my dirty clothes and cleaned me up. The check my whole body for bruises and cuts. My hands and feet hurt so they did an xray on them and they found my broken toe. I slept a lot while I was in the ER so they may have done other stuff while I slept. They decided to keep me overnight for observation just to make sure I was doing okay. I don't remember what they gave me to eat or drink, but most likely since it was a hospital it didn't taste very good.  
Thanks for your answer :)

Hello I know that I'm about 8 years too late but. How does your daughter react to your story?  
Hi, sorry it took so long to reply to you, I don't come on here much at all. How do you know I have a daughter? Did I mention that in my post somewhere? It's been a long time since I wrote it so it may have slipped my mind. To answer your question, she thinks the story is a bit funny since I didn't really go into detail for her about how terrified I was, but she also realized on her own how scary it would be to be trapped and alone like that all weekend.  
Yeah I think you mentioned your daughter in somewhere in comments?- it's also slipped my mind as well, Sorry if I made it sound like I'm a stalker. 😅

How did he react to the soiled locker?  
He was more worried about me than anything, but his locker wasn't that bad. I had only peed and my jeans had soaked up most of it. But the janitor was nice enough to clean the inside of his locker before he even got to school. In fact he didn't even know what had happened until a few hours into school when the principal called him to his office. He of course noticed his lock was missing, but didn't know what happened to it until the principal talked to him.  
Not sure if you're still answering questions for this lama (amazing story by the way), but after all of the pounding and kicking, was the locker bent up or anything?

What do you look like? Was your boyfriend angry that you did that or was he sympathetic?  
I am white, I have very dark brown hair, so dark you could almost call it black. I have brown eyes. I am short, only 5' 3" and I was just a little shorter when I was trapped in that locker. I am thin, but not like a lanky type of thin. He was sympathetic and was very protective of me after this happened.  
That was nice of him! Mind if I ask why you broke up?

Hmm Good thing I have a habit of pinging my wife and kids every 4 hrs or less. I get paranoid and this story has me in anxious knots.  You are certainly very brave for staying a night in an empty school, in a dark hallway, locked inside a small locker. However can't say the idea to go into a locker was wise. Highschool is a time by which such actions and their risks should hold some gravity for teenagers.  
I think that may have been the most scary, how alone I was. There was no other person in the building but me. Honestly, I think it may have been more scary to wander the dark hallways all night alone than to be trapped in a locker. At least it is a small space that feels secure instead of being in a big open area where creepy things could lurk in the shadows.  
Thank god for cell phones nowadays, amiright?

Hello! First of all I'm sorry about your experience, but I'm also happy that it didn't end up worse. You said that you expected to die. When you thought about it, did you have some thoughts like, you regretted doing/not doing something, doing something in your life differently. If so, did you later act upon these reflections?

How did it feel to walk after standing like that for so long?  Were you even able to being so dehydrated?  
I didn't walk, I didn't even try, when they opened the locker they helped me out and lowered me to the floor. The paramedics came and took me from there. I didn't walk until several hours later at the hospital. My legs were really sore for several days afterwards.  
I can only imagine how sore they were.  Thanks for answering my question.

On behalf of Chuck Klosterman...  Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn anymore; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein? Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. Would you attempt to do this? Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. Which option do you select? You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Credence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a Capella (but it will only sound this way to you). Would you swallow the pill? At long last, someone invents "the dream VCR." This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR. Would you still do this? Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story? You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's "deeper philosophy." Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual? A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commercial success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likelihood of you reading this book? You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill. Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie? You meet a wizard. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, "I will now make them a dollar more attractive." He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. How much cash do you give the wizard? For reasons that cannot be explained, cats can suddenly read at a twelfth-grade level. They can't talk and they can't write, but they can read silently and understand the text. Many cats love this new skill, because they now have something to do all day while they lay around the house; however, a few cats become depressed, because reading forces them to realize the limitations of their existence (not to mention the utter frustration of being unable to express themselves). This being the case, do you think the average cat would enjoy Garfield, or would cats find this cartoon to be an insulting caricature? You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. The surgery is in two weeks. How do you spend the next fourteen days? You have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. Which option do you select? Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack? For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. Which film would you be most interested in seeing?  Edit: For those wondering, these questions are a subset of Chuck Klosterman's Hypertheticals. I'd have included more but Reddit only allows 10,000 characters per reply.  
If this was me:   Yes he would be more impressive than Albert Einstein. I'd kick the shit out of that horse. What's the best body part to aim for when you're kicking a horse to death? I'd pick the turtle and do my best to keep it alive. I'd take the pill. I wouldn't do it. The capture of Nessie and Bigfoot. I watched the Dark Crystal in grade 6 and thought it was alright, I wouldn't have an issue with this person. It would decrease the likelihood of me reading it. I'll come to that conclusion by myself. My mom died last year, but in this hypothetical situation where she's alive I'd leave the theatre and go check on my mother. As much as I can spare. I think 70% wouldd find it really offensive and the other 30% would find it hilarious due to how completely wrong it is and they'd think that humans are dumb for coming up with that idea. I'd do everything I could to make life easier for my stupid self. I'd right an instruction manual on how to deal with things and other stuff like that.  While I'm not overly excited about either option, I'd choose a year in Europe. The public will be able to go to the moon soon enough. P.S: does stipend mean that I'd get paid $2000 every month?  I'd give them $200 and say that friend number 2 bet me $200 that I wouldn't do it. The Columbia Tri Star production to see what their take on my life is. I can ask my friends about what they said later.   
Solid answers.  On #6, are you saying you'd combine the Nessie and Bigfoot stories into one? Clever. If you had to split the story, however, which one gets the top healine on the NYT? On #13, yes you'd get $2000/month  
On behalf of Chuck Klosterman...  Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn anymore; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein? Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. Would you attempt to do this? Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. Which option do you select? You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Credence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a Capella (but it will only sound this way to you). Would you swallow the pill? At long last, someone invents "the dream VCR." This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR. Would you still do this? Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week.

Yes. No. Hitler's Skull Yes. No. Loch Ness No. Decrease. Exit. $20 The latter. I would spend the two weeks studying brain surgery in order to develop an alternative surgical method that can remove my tumor while sparing my frontal lobe. I then teach it to the surgeons that are to operate on me. Done. Ten minutes on the moon is more than long enough to kill me. I'll take the former. If I kicked my friend in the ribcage as hard as I could, he'd probably die from internal bleeding. I must therefore be going mad. I don't kick him. The latter.  
I'd be highly impressed if you could, in 2 weeks, learn more about brain surgery than a team of surgeons who went to medical school.

Your worst fear is becoming immortal?  I think this bears explaning  
The elves in Tolkien's world saw the mortality of men as a gift from Ilúvatar. Immortality would mean a stronger connection to the world you live in and the harm done to it, as well as, as I think Tolkien himself put it, not being able to see the beauty in the small things in life.

Do you remember your most confusing/distressing dream? What was it about?  
I only remember a few things.  It involved me playing a chess game against the guy with a mask. The guy was a serial killer, and I was his latest victim. If I lost the chess game, he would kill me, if I won, he would make me kill him. There was constantly scary music playing. Like genuinely terrifying. Since this was a dream, I didn't question where it was coming from. He kept giggling quietly the whole time. I won. He took off his mask. He was me. I woke up screaming. I was 12 at the time.

My boyfriend doesn't want to come to my family's house for Christmas. Even though he has a good reason (his car has issues) and we've only been dating about a month, it still hurts my feeling. It's not like he has something else to do that day--he's Jewish. Should I tell him how I feel even though it's not rational?  
I'd like to add on as well that since its a big family holiday and you two have only been together a month he may feel uncomfortable being there since he isn't family.   
Yeah.  And coming to a family gathering can feel like a big commitment step for a lot of people.  If you get too involved with someone's family too early and then things don't work out...you'd feel like you were letting a lot more people down. I personally wouldn't confront a boyfriend of one month about it.  I wouldn't air any irrational feelings to a boyfriend of one month. You know, over time, people get to know that you're a rational person (if you are).  Before they know that for sure, it can really spook them.

At which point did your parents explain that you are unique? Also, how does this happen?   
They didn’t know until at puberty I had painful abdominal bloating and swelling. I’m basically what happens when opposite sex twins fuse in the womb.  
Do you know what would have happened if same-sex twins had fused in the womb?  Would there have been any way to know?    
There's a pretty well known case of a woman failing a maternity test for the child she very definitely gave birth to because she was a chimera and her child genetically was of her twin.  
Do you know what would have happened if same-sex twins had fused in the womb?  Would there have been any way to know?    
I have a friend who fused with her identical twin. While I assume this can also happen without any adverse issues,  she wound up two sets of fully functional reproductive systems. She had a hysterectomy to remove one of the sets because she said their menstrual cycles weren’t synced up so she was almost constantly pmsing and bleeding (among other complications). She’s fine now.

From where did the lining of the uterus leave your body?  Read: where did your period come out?   
I don’t have a vagina, so they found out I was intersex from the massive, painful bloating of my abdomen. They put me under anesthesia and drained it through a tube near my navel.  
I feel almost rude asking, but like the other commenter said, was this a one time thing or did you have a hysterectomy?  
I don’t have a vagina, so they found out I was intersex from the massive, painful bloating of my abdomen. They put me under anesthesia and drained it through a tube near my navel.  
So that was a one time thing or did it reoccur?

Do you have any advice for parents of intersex children? What do you wish people knew about being intersex, and how would you change cultural perception of intersex people if you could?  
I would say be as honest as possible. Sorta like adoption (I’m also adopted.) Don’t pressure them to be one gender role over the other. Encourage them to have whatever interests they want, regardless of gender stereotyping. I wish people knew we exist and have normal, healthy lives. People seem to act like we’re mole people who hide in the shadows ready to eat young children. Also, that each one of us have different situations, organs, interests, and self-expressions, so one size probably doesn’t fit all.

He’s a big teddy bear, but he’s had to hold his own in fights throughout his life because people think he wants to fight because of his genetics and his mean looking face.

His arms are really big and jacked. They get crazier when he has a pump. Cartoonishly big.

Since you have been transitioning to look more feminine I'm curious as whether you, personally, want to have a vagina? It sounds like you have a functioning penis and testicles, do you want them removed or do you want to keep them? Also, if you remember, how does the pain of period cramps compare to taking a hit to your balls?  
No interest in having a synthetic vagina. I have an, “add on, not permanently remove” mentality when it comes to my body modifications. The cramps felt about the same as getting hit in the balls...but consistent, versus a traumatic burst of pain. Getting slapped in the boobs (Edit: directly on the nipples) feels just like getting hit in the balls.  
 Getting slapped in the boobs feels just like getting hit in the balls.  I'm honestly surprised by that since I've never keeled over from taking a hit to my breasts but I've seen guys drop from taking a hit to the balls many times. If you start menstruating internally again, then what? Do you just keep draining it?  The cramps felt about the same as getting hit in the balls...but consistent, versus a traumatic burst of pain.  If you ever had the pleasure of getting an IUD you'd find that your consistent cramps get turned into random traumatic bursts of pain instead. Much fun.  
So I’m talking directly on the nipples. Unless it’s only that painful when they’re growing. I guess if I start menstruating again, I’ll see what treatment I can get, but I don’t know if that will happen.

I doubled over in pain from a hit directly to the breasts once, I was about 11 or 12 at the time so perhaps they were more sensitive then.

How does your status as an intersex chimera affect your social life?  
I’m pretty much a hermit due to social anxieties. I mostly play video games and hang out with my boyfriend. He says I need to get out more.  
Well, I’m really sorry to hear that. I wish you well in finding a homey tribe :-)  
Thanks! We’re both sort of loners who’ve been through a lot, so we are a tribe of our own.

Are you considering bottom surgery at some point and if so, what would that mean with your anatomy? Would they be able to connect your vagina to your uterus? I’d imagine that would become more of a priority if your period comes back.  (You don’t have to answer if you don’t want, and I do realize that not all trans people want/need surgery. I’m interested in the logistical side.) Thanks for doing this AMA!

Do all of your male parts function correctly still? Or are they now non functioning due to your transition?  
Still functional. I’m on progesterone, so I haven’t lost any drive and my boyfriend has high testosterone (he’s a bodybuilder) so no problems with libido or anything.  
Would it have been possible for you to basically "clone" yourself if you didn't get any hormone treatment in the past?  
I don’t think so, because I’m sorta like 2 colors of paint partially mixed together, whereas if I were cloned, you’d only get either one or the other colors.

I don’t know how well they function, but they might have been kickstarted by my HRT. I loooooove kids. I used to cry over not being able to give birth. Wanted to be a mother instead of a father before I understood how it all worked. I’ve always wanted 2 boys and a girl, all adopted (I was adopted). Girl in the middle, in case that comes up. It’s just not financially feasible to have so many kids in this economic climate, but still more socially responsible than giving birth, right now (with all the unadopted kids in the world.)  
Fostering may be a bridge to your dream.  Prob varies by state, but foster parents get gov’t assistance (some scammers use fostering as their means of support, to the detriment of the children).  Same goes for adoption of foster kids.  Something to think about, perhaps?  
I thought about it, but I’m only one part of a team. Adoption seems to be agreed, though my boyfriend has mentioned that if I could have eggs recovered he would love to have a biological child of our own, but not a must.

Forgive my ignorance on the topic, but what does your boyfriend identify as? Super interesting AMA, thanks for sharing your story!  
He is straight guy who is transamorous. He also finds ciswomen attractive. He identifies as, “a buff motherfucker.” Edit: he just said, “as a 5’10”, 245 lb broomstick.”  
I asked this on a trans or lgbt subreddit one time on a throwaway, if being attracted to feminine trans women but also being sexually attracted to dick on women was fetishizing them, and they absolutely blew up at me. They couldnt understand that I am attracted to and have dated and would possibly marry a Cis woman, or passing trans woman. Like, im sexually attracted to male parts, but only if they are attached to a very feminine person, but I still see them as women, and would date a trans woman with no problem. They claimed I fetishized them, and it's difficult to explain i think? What do you think? Ive dated a trans woman before, and it wasnt for sex, she was a wonderful gal. I just like dick AND vagina on girls, i guess?  
I think many transwomen are sensitive to being fetishized because we aren’t treated very well. Most guys who are into us want to go back to their regular ciswomen programming when they want to settle down or have an actual relationship. I, personally, would only want to be with cismen who are specifically attracted to transwomen. I’d rather be a fetish than an experiment. But I’m Asian, so I’m very, VERY used to being fetishized or marginalized.  
He is straight guy who is transamorous. He also finds ciswomen attractive. He identifies as, “a buff motherfucker.” Edit: he just said, “as a 5’10”, 245 lb broomstick.”  
I will take buff motherfucker - real talk though I'd never heard of transamorous before so that was a nice bit of knowledge,  thanks for the answer! Wishing you luck on your transition.

Do you know what term I would use? I don’t know where I’m at on the straight-bi spectrum but I’m a female who is attracted to men and mtf. I’m slightly attracted to women but my only sexual encounter I had with a woman was a train wreck. I don’t know if it’s that I’m not sexually attracted to women or if it was the specific women I was with. Or maybe it’s just I’m attracted to women but vaginas weird me out

Fellow Endosister here. I about cried when I read that you had it, I can't imagine how painful and scary that must have been for you, both physically and mentally. Did the doctors happen to say if your Endo developed because of a lack of outlet for the menstrual blood/tissues or was it idiopathic like most women?

I think it’s absolutely wonderful that your bf is so accepting and supportive. I’ll never understand people who are discriminatory or hateful towards trans people in general, but especially intersex people. Like you can help the way your were born...that’s not your fault or preventable. Some people suck. That being said, my question is: has this been an issue in the past with relationships? Have all of your romantic partners been as understanding? That’s highly personal and I’m in no way entitled to an answer. But I was curious about it.  Thank you for the CasualAMA!   
It has been an issue in past relationships because I was a feminine man which is arguably the least desirable gender-sex combination in society, so many partners treated me like they were doing me a favor. Most romantic partners did not know, because I haven’t felt comfortable enough to share it with people when I’m trying to fit into a masculine box. No problem about the AMA!  
Oh gosh, I’m so sorry people have treated you that way. You seem like an amazing person and they should’ve felt honored to know you instead of treating you like a pity project. That’s narcissistic of them at best. I can see how it would be much easier to hide as well, being that your female parts are internal, though I’m sorry again that you have had to hide anything at all. I hope that you’re now able to completely be yourself and I’m so glad that you’re able to transition into the beautiful woman you were meant to be! Yours is not an easy road to travel, but it seems as though you’ve handled it with grace and class. Go you!  On a side note: stories like yours just drive home for me that my daughter, who is lesbian, will have a tough road but should always hold her head high, and that we should give her all of the love, support, and acceptance that is humanly possible. We have a very laid back household and I’ve raised both of my kids to just be who they are, and love who they love. Regardless of gender, race, religion, family status, etc... Whether they conform to societal norms or not. When she first acted like she was interested in girls, (I had pretty much figured it out already) I made it clear to her that we don’t care who she loves, so long as she’s happy and they’re good to her. She’s 15 now, an amazing young lady, and has a wonderful girlfriend of her own. We’re so proud of her for being who she is meant to be without letting anyone make her into someone she is not. My son is straight so far as we know, but he has always been told the same. I never could imagine being the kind of mother who could distance themselves from their child over something like gender choice or sexual orientation.

You don't have to answer if you aren't comfortable, but you mentioned you have both testicles and ovaries, so does that mean you have both sperm and eggs? If so, are they both viable for conception (as in would you be able to use either your sperm to fertilize a donor egg or have your eggs fertilized with donor sperm)?   
I have both, yes. But I don’t think my eggs would be viable after so long, and my sperm is probably infertile due to HRT.  
Eggs are stored in an immature form until the ovaries are ready to release them (usually one each month). They do start degrading but they are generally just as viable as ever until your late 30's.  Most people trying to get pregnant after 45 end up using donor eggs but before that it depends on the person.  
You have to remember that you are speaking about ciswomen who haven’t had medical procedures to destroy their female sex organs, though.  
I Am an Intersex Chimera (MTF) AMA
what are your thoughts on your parents essentially trying to choose your gender for you and giving you steroids?   
They were horrible before and after, so in retrospect, it’s not something surprising that they would do. My parents, more than most, did everything they could to interfere with my life.  
I’m so sorry you went through what you did with them, and so glad you have a supportive partner and freedom now! I hope you can build the family of adopted kids you mention; your stance on the ethics of adoption seems to come from a place of such thoughtfulness and empathy that I bet you’ll be a fantastic parent! Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA.

A lot of questions here are focusing on your sexuality, but I'm curious about the two sets of DNA. Forgive me if I don't word this right, I'm not quite sure that our language is equipped to fully portray my question Consciousness. We are essentially self aware dna living in a meat bag. Since you're composed of essentially two people biologically, so you ever feel like there's a second set if wants or needs in your head with you?  Not like having multiple personalities or anything negative  But if you have two twins (especially fraternal) they're going to have different wants needs and thoughts. Since technically both of you are in you, I'm curious if there's ever a conflict or discussion or if the two "sides" even exist at all Thanks for the ama by the way! I had no idea that something this awesome was even possible, and I'm glad that you've been able to adapt and enjoy a life so rare!   
Well, since I’m a fusion, I think my identity is a combination of whatever individuals existed, before. I would understand it if they separately developed and then fused, but I’ve never felt like 2 individuals inhabiting 1.

Biologically, people who are chimeras still have one brain. It's just that its development was influenced by both sets of genes, be they both XX, or one XX and one XY (haven't heard of a double XY chimera so I'm not sure if it's possible). This is different than conjoined twins, who have two brains, and sometimes overlapping nervous and circulatory systems. That would be where people may potentially share consciousness.  
I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate, are you aware of any chimeras who are not conjoined twins, who have reported seperate consciousness? I'd love to read more if there's something out there, or even a conjoined twin case that you've found interesting

Thank you for your reply. I'm sad to hear your parents didn't support you. I hope they will/have realise what an awesome daughter they have. You sound very genuine, helpful and kind. Good luck with the further transition, however far you decide to take it. Thanks for being you, you rock!  
I Am an Intersex Chimera (MTF) AMA
Good luck on the transitioning. I know the bodily changes can be C.R.A.Z.Y.  Also, please forgive those of us who are supportive but fuck up with pronouns accidentally. I am guilty of that and feel so damn bad whenever I mess up   
I’m lucky enough to never have had pronoun problems because I’m really feminine. I’m also not very sensitive: I curse like a sailor and I troll my boyfriend in a constant stream of teasing and stupid puns. As long as you try, I don’t see how anyone should get upset. Just remember that a lot of us trans folk have had really, really bad experiences, so that may make most more sensitive.

Do you have a prostate?   
I do! Everything a regular Xy male has, plus a uterus and ovaries.  
From a medical standpoint, I am just wondering how is the internal arrangement of your organs. Does it get "crowded" on your insides? Is there also a vestigial clit involved? Nature is bloody wonderful. Also, what about the stuff that very clearly falls on either the male or female side (dimorphic traits, genetically speaking)? I know you answered about boobs and beard and voicebox, but what about the subtler things, like say, pelvis shape - is it wide like a woman or narrow like man? Could your mammaries lactate, given you're under a barrage of female hormones? What about lung capacity/nostril size? And what about genetic susceptibility to diseases because there are a variety of diseases and disorders that selectively affect men/women over the other gender? And if it's a mixed bag, did you end up getting best of both deals or the worst?  
I can’t tell about any organ crowding. I suspect most people can’t really tell, unless it’s horrible. My penis is what would be a vestigial clit. Erectile tissue develops into either a clit or a penis. My boyfriend says my hips are wider than most ciswomen he’s dated. I lactate (boyfriend loves it.) My lung capacity is reaaaaally big. I played the saxophone. My nose looks just like an Asian nose. I have a few genetic abnormalities. Marfan Syndrome being one. I’m more susceptible to a lot of cancers, simply due to HRT. My bones are lighter, but apparently harder than most people. I guess I’m a bird? I don’t really know of other conditions that I’m susceptible to due to my chimerism.

Hey, thanks for doing the AMA! At the risk of me sounding like an idiot - how do you feel about partially having a body made of two twins fused together? At what point does this fusion occur and do you have any other physical or other characteristics (besides those mentioned) that you think could be explained by you being "two people in one"?  
I mean...it’s my body. No use being mad about it. The fusion occurs during fetal development. I have chimeric patterns on my chest (symmetrical, like a butterfly) and swirls on my legs.  
That's so cool! So like birthmarks I guess?  
Sort of, but it’s more like patches of skin that are mirrored or swirled. They may tan differently, or one set of skin might have more sensitivities / allergies than the other. It’s weird.

Can you get pregnant?  
I don’t know, but my boyfriend sure tries...

So DNA tests to track your heritage are all the rage right now. If you took two, what are the chances that they would have the same outcome? I mean even as fraternal twins they would be similar, but my sister and I also had some variances on ours. Especially as you were adopted, have you tried anything like that? Thanks so much for your AMA!  
They would have the same heritage. Twins still have the same mom and dad. Your heritage should be the same, the markers that they test for just might not be included in what testing places look for. The variances would be different in terms of expression (skin, hair color, etc.) I don’t want my DNA to be tested because of information being given to parties that I don’t personally authorize.

Probably the most interesting AMA I’ve seen here. Thank you so much for doing this.  What are your thoughts on gender dysmorphia in general? It’s something I myself struggle to understand but I feel like everything you’ve experienced makes absolute sense.  When you meet trans people that don’t have an identifiable genetic/biological conflict (?) with gender, do you feel like there’s any difference between them and yourself? Is gender dysmorphia honestly something that society should just accept without question? I swear I don’t have a set position on the matter. This is something I’m truly curious about and seems super conflicting to me whenever it comes up.  Thanks!

Assuming you are male. If you were drugged, (unconscious) then given drugs to ensure an erection. You wake up to your naked drugged mother in front of you and you are partially inserted. Your father has also been drugged similarly and is partially inserted into you. The only way to escape is to fully insert yourself into your mother, which will remove your father from your anus and allowing you to twist away.

Nice cake! Definitely add frosting

This has been making me think a lot about books and articles from decades ago or even centuries ago where the authors thought that due to automation, by now we’d be working like 15 hours a week while robots did the rest, leaving us to enjoy the pleasures of life. I guess those people assumed we’d still make the same wages, or perhaps inflation wouldn’t be a thing. Whoops.  
Don't get it wrong, we are indeed making more profit for less work (at least in industry) but the higher ups are the ones that pocket all that surplus. Isn't it why we have so many billionaires today?  
Profits since the 1980s in America have risen ~1000%, meanwhile the federal minimum wage has been stagnant.  
That's definitely something to be mad about. When profits rise so much but the salaries barely keep up with inflation (if they do) then you know something's wrong  
Profits since the 1980s in America have risen ~1000%, meanwhile the federal minimum wage has been stagnant.  
Don't even look at minimum wage. Look at median household income. The increases in median household income has not kept up with inflation. The buying power for those right in the middle is diminishing year after year.  Minimum wage workers are fucked. That's a given and that needs to be fixed. But things are getting worse for so many more, too. We need to do something that helps everybody in the bottom 97%.

Go read Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber. That was this century, and essentially we only do a few hours of actual work each day, the rest is busy work.

They assumed we would get paid for our work, and not for the time we spend at work. An interesting take on it is Bullshit Jobs, which says that we are made to work 40+ hours a week because employers want to get 'their money's worth'.  
I'm a teacher in a school where all the students have been sent home. We are still required to show up for our contracted hours. Today during a meeting our superintendent was talking about how we'd have to keep finding work for hourly employees to do so we could keep paying them. We aren't a restuarant  or a store that's shutdown and not making money. The budget is already setup. But we need to run through the motions since we couldnt possibly just pay these people anyway.

The trick is to tax the robots just like the human workers would have been.

Which was pretty much what Andrew Yang was running on.  
Yea really wish he didn’t drop out  
His drop out was intelligent, well timed, and considerate of the other progressive candidates. He knew he couldn't win with his numbers, and he was all about the numbers. Warren on the other hand.....

It has nothing to do with inflation. It has to do with creating artificial demand for useless stuff (and also creating useless jobs) so that more people work so that the system can continue working and generating profit. We really don't need to work nearly as much as we do.  
Yeah, I think that’s what some of those old predictions were getting at. Work would be something like the community going “Oh shit, the levee’s breaking, cmon lads, let’s go fill sandbags and then drink a few rounds afterwards to unwind!” (Though I guess the robots could do that too 😂) Instead if I wanted to fill sandbags I’d have to take work off from my real job (if bossman says yes).

Worst thing is that for that to become a reality we just need a slight change in things, not need for a crazy revolution.  But some dickheads in Wall Street think a billion dollars is not enough.

Honestly, if I were laid off (and I'm the primary breadwinner), my stress level would initially be high, but then... a world of possibility. I would not be interested in pursuing new work in the same soul-sucking industry I'm in now, that's for sure.  
What industry is that if I may ask?  
Health insurance  
This is kinda ironic

A world of possibilities until bills are due lol  
Yeah wtf lol I was laid off my hobbies and passions are on hold rn it’s not rainbows and happiness like this thread makes it seem but must be nice I’m worried about bills and if places will even be hiring and when

Yeah I’ve noticed this too. Although there’s stress and panic. People have also found time to fall back in love with their hobbies.  
I’ve used the first days of this time to do everything I said I wanted to get done but never had time for - clean my room, go through papers, exercise, etc.. It has been nice.  
Yeah we’ve got a puppy at the moment. I did not like him. My girlfriend already worked from home so she spent all day juggling work and looking after him. Then I’d come home after 9hrs of a stressful management position plus commuting and I’d have to take over from her so wouldn’t get a single second break from 6:30am to 11pm.  I self isolated last Weds and it’s been awesome to spend time with my girlfriend and puppy. The work all still gets done too.  10/10 would coronavirus again.  If it only it wasn’t for this whole pesky economic depression thing...and the fact I’ll lose my job and might die.

So many businesses will die during this pandemic, but I’m guessing many will sprout after it’s all over. I would bet on Etsy just blowing up with new sellers. Edit- why are people so butthurt over me speculating that people will sell things they make online?  
Now THAT'S  a thought I'd better go and see what some of my favorite artists are up to Edit: update- I reached out to them and I've put forward some comissions and offerred on some of their pieces. Support your artists, if you can!

Etsy is such shit to its sellers now honestly. They’ve never been great but they’ve really gone downhill lately. If someone on there sells another place I usually message them to ask which platform they prefer my purchase on. No one has preferred Etsy so far!

Totally! I do feel we spend far too much of our time at work. If people only had to work 3 days a week, everyone would be a lot happier and well-rounded.  
Healthier, happier, more compassion, more time to laugh dance, exercise. Alas we humans have been so manipulated by the rich and psychopaths

I knew this before but everyone would shame me into being a lazy ass... but now people actually see what I mean. We need max. 6 hour work days and a lot more free time!! More time with family, with oneself and your hobbies

I don't get how people are so resistant to the idea that work sucks. It's either a coping mechanism, or they literally can't think of ways to live life other than working for someone else.

In the 3 days that I have worked part-time, I notice that I do not need to rush.    Monday I was walking the dog and rushing through it, as usual, when I remembered there was no place I had to rush off to.   I still keep rushing through laundry, taking a shower, everything.

Unless you work in health care, unfortunately  
Or retail.....  
Yeppp. I work in one of those superstores (EU), and there has been an endless stream of people coming in, for a good week now; wearing gloves and masks and what not, YET bringing their kids, or older people wandering around, and the hoarders, everything you can imagine.  At this point I just accepted that I'll get sick eventually, if am not already without me knowing it. Also, due to people buying up everything, some of us have to work extra hours. So, if I can be honest, I'm not even remotely happy, or relaxed.  
Or retail.....

The main thing coronavirus has taught me is, how disgustingly selfish, we as a society have become.  If this was a test to see how we'd fair in a nuclear holocaust, we have failed miserably.  People bulk buying toilet paper? Why?? There isnt a shortage. And it's never been said there will be.  Having fights because someone has a packet you think you need? Grow up you vile person.  Now its tins. Doesnt matter the contents either. Someone is probably sitting there with 200 tins of peach slices.  For no other reason than they think they MIGHT need some in a few weeks. When was the last time you ate some??  All the local supermarket companies have said there is no need to panic buy, that their supplies are not running low or even that there will be a problem with supply.  Why then, does it look like a plague of locusts have swarmed through every aisle of every shop? Because people are selfish.  Now, even though the Prime minister has told everyone to not go to pubs, clubs and restaurants, I see exactly that.  Lots genuinely believe it isnt going to affect them, and will be the first to cry when it does.  I was a cynic initially, but this whole scenario is so weird and surreal, I can't risk being cynical because of my children.  
Today I went to the grocery store and this lady was piling up ~7 cartons of eggs in her basket. It made me really sad. I don't need eggs right now, I just got a carton yesterday, but this was at 9am. How many people will be able to go shopping after 5 because their jobs won't allow for remote work? How many of them need eggs, a staple food and a cheap source of protein? Will they still be able to buy them or will they run out well before then? How long will it take this lady to eat 72 84 eggs? Will she do it before they go bad or is this going to be wasted food for no reason? I actually gave her a thumbs down and walked away.  
I'm still trying to wrap my head around it too. Do people think their caloric needs will triple because of quarantine? Milk, eggs, etc go bad relatively quickly!  
The only change I’ve made is buying a little extra than I usually would so I can make 1 less trip to the store. And buying some yeast so I can make homemade bread. Probably unnecessary but just in case someone else wants to buy that loaf of store bread it’s there and I’ll have a nice homemade loaf. Doubt there is a rush on yeast.

Maybe. My speculation about toilet paper is that a bunch of people who usually poop at work just realized they're going to have to do it at home for the foreseeable future.  And multiply that by the number of people living in the house. You could speculate something similar about food.  Going from eating every meal away from home to every meal at home it could be easy to overestimate what you need. The tragedy of the commons works at almost every scale.

You can freeze eggs FYI

This coronavirus things has made me realize people would be a lot happier and explore their passions and interests if they didn’t have to work so much.
I work 25 hours a week and it leaves me with enough free time to enjoy my hobbies. I know not everyone has that option but I could never imagine myself working 8 hours a day 5 days in a week.  
In my line of work, if you don't work at least 10 hours a day, you aren't working hard enough.  I hate that this has proliferated our workplace so thoroughly.  We get shit on for taking one day off a month.  It blows.  
Sounds like a toxic workplace environment. And theyd be happy enough to replace anyone if they dropped from stress Im sure. :/ May I ask what your line of work is (generally speaking only)

Now try 12.  
I know right. I’m working 55-60 hours a week and it’s literally like I have no life. My free time consists of me cleaning my room or going to the doctors, or a birthday party for a kid. It sucks

You're just realizing this now? I've known this my whole life, no I've felt it in my soul. It makes integrating into the usual work-life incredibly difficult for me.  People around me are asking for overtime and I can barely string together the will for 40hrs.

Eh, I think we disproportionately see the people who are online all the time being happy. Most of the people I have talked to who arent the type to browse reddit or be an "inside" kind of person are pretty miserable atm.  
I'd agree with that. I used to be a heavy gamer and basically lived online. Now I'm hyper social. I literally live to see people basically. My ideal week has 4-5 social occasions (as an example last week before social isolation in the UK I went on 2 dates and saw friends twice). I'm absolutely fucking miserable at the moment. My gym routine has been fucked, the swimming pool is closed, I can't see my friends enough, people don't want to go on dates + everything is basically closed anyway. I've been trying to get back into shit like gaming that I used to do all the time, but that's just not me anymore. Similarly my friends are all pretty annoyed and want to get out, it's just coming up on a week for us this Sunday.

Check out r/antiwork or r/latestagecapitalism More and more people are getting tired of working their lives away. Corporate greed and the top 1% is making all the decisions for us.  
I wish I was reconnecting with hobbies. Instead, this time has confirmed what I was already suspecting - that my boss is a psychopath. Her approach to this time is “why won’t you work 14 hour days, we’re all on lockdown, what else are you going to do?” I don’t know, take a fucking nap? Have dinner with my partner? Cry?  
Start planning your exit strategy. Life is more than work.

Having hobby time is nice but I’m able to see my daughter more. I work 40hrs a week, and go to school full time. My days go from 6am-8pm on most days of the week. I wish I didn’t have to be away from my daughter so much. I feel like I’m not even a part of her life sometimes. That may be a dramatic statement but it sucks. Now, I get to see her everyday and I’m already going crazy keeping her in the house. She’s in her terrible twos lmao

I crochet a lot and have a huge stash of yarn.    I’m currently still working but this may change.     I’m thinking of making blankets for the elderly or something useful.  But I’ve not decided yet.      Sometimes hospitals ask for premature baby things so maybe that.     Any suggestions welcome.

I befriended a guy at work that a lot of people look down on and make fun of and it is changing my life.
That’s amazing, great message!  Fits with the golden rule, treat others as you want to be treated.  
Definitely! We live in a hyper critical world and I always strive to include anyone I can because I definitely know what it's like to be lonely. It has really helped me build some decent friends over the years. My best friend just moved to a foreign country so it is definitely refreshing to have someone besides my wife to hang with outside of work and to be able to talk freely with. I love my wife but also think it's important to have more people to hang with than just her.( Probably something I carried with me from my social work degree that I never got a job with)  
I feel like the people you work with are just a little bit jelly of Mr New and In Shape guy.  People often judge others and try to bring them down when they see people excelling in order to make themselves feel better.  You keep doing you, keep being friends with this guy and I bet you are helping him as much as he is helping you. It’s really easy to fall out of healthy habits when surrounded by an unhealthy work environment and judgmental people that don’t share the same goals you share.  You are helping this guy stay on track by being his friend and supporting him!  
Yeah. I've never seen this kind of reaction so I'm not sure if it's just social distancing making people go crazy or what! They are definitely jelly!

I mean, having a social work degree probably helps a lot. Still, many people do not have these skills. I still encourage all, to listen and to "defend" the weird and lonely at work. I had this guy at work, who was really really weird. We soon named him Taxi Driver. He then put more effort in his tries to socialize, and he failed even  harder. I was always neutral towards him, but as he literally shaved his head himself with an undercut, almost like the "real" Taxi Driver, i hit the breaks. He definitely was short before killing himself. He left the company eventually. I took him aside, taught him some social "rules" and he broke into tears... he never had a conversation with anyone, that was longer than one minute - for six months... (for me heaven, for him hell...)

The greatest lesson my father ever taught me was, "never judge someone based on what another said." I have made many beautiful friendships because of this advice.  Thanks dad :-)

I definitely feel like I have! I was diagnosed with hypertension a few months ago and all those other people  who said I could join them at the gym always found excuses on short notice of why it wasn't a good time for me to join or the few times I did made me feel bad for being overweight.  
[deleted]  
Thanks! I felt embarrassed to ask him at first because he was in such good shape and I am not morbidly obese but definitely obese. I use to run 9 miles every other day in high school but college and married life, and this office job  took a toll on me.

This guy is giving you thousands of dollars worth of personal training for free. Now measure that against the health benefits + the time + education needed to acquire the health knowledge he is sharing with you, and it easily adds up to hundreds of thousands.  
Definitely very grateful! It's a good way to look at it. It's still very early on so we will see what happens but I am excited with the prospects of a long friendship.

No, winning the lottery is blind luck. You saw a good person and was courageous enough to ignore the social consequences and treat him with respect, compassion, and genuine curiosity. Unlike blind luck, you deserve this. Way to go!

Yeah. It's so dumb. It's like how people who try be vegetarian or vegan for health reason are the butt of so many jokes. My guess it's because others have their insecurities poked when someone comes along living life to its fullest.  
Honestly, the way you described your friend - he sounds like a total dude who has carved out his own individuality and independence, and puts higher value on what he wants then what others think of him. Goals right there.  
Yeah. It's so dumb. It's like how people who try be vegetarian or vegan for health reason are the butt of so many jokes. My guess it's because others have their insecurities poked when someone comes along living life to its fullest.  
That’s the truth. Too many people let their insecurities define them and tell them they can’t change for the better with hard work. When they see someone coming along putting in that work to achieve a lofty goal, they knock it as unreasonable or unrealistic to attain.  
Exactly. It's easier to knock people down then to strive to be better. Or so some people think!

Super nice story! Just want to point out that a sub 10 minute mile is not bad, that's above average. The average person runs a mile between 10 and 15 mins. I run about a 13:40 mile with a 5K time of 43 mins. The average for my age group is 35 mins for comparison.  
Thanks! I appreciate the encouragement. I need to stop being so harsh on myself. I have a problem comparing myself to my younger self when I could run sub 7 minutes miles( I think my too speed was 6 minutes and 20 seconds) . I have a problem where I live in my nostalgia and don't want to put the effort to get back into shape.  Plus needing to shed 60lbs of fat seems like such a daunting task I keep on giving up.  
I couldn’t go out today and run a mile under 10 mins. Or 3 miles in one day. I am somewhat fit, but running my has never been a strong point. You keep that up and you should see serious results :0)

A 10 minute mile for someone claiming to be obese is ridiculously good, and I'm not just saying that to lift your spirits or anything.  When I was in HS, in ok shape, my mile time was like a lazy ass 11 or 12 minutes.  Now that I'm in much better shape (10+ years later), went to the gym consistently this year till they shut down, I managed to bring it to around 8 mins, 7 something if I really pushed myself. But it kicks my ass at the end of it, and it's only a mile.  So you're doing really really well man.

Breaking the stigma of the quiet guy one exercise guru at a time. Nice.  
I'm not sure I know what stigma you are referring to. I'm probably just brain dead so if you don't clarify it now I will hopefully click when I wake up tomorrow... But if you have time to clarify that'd be super cool as well!  
Stigma that most quiet guys are somehow big weirdos and nerdy, maybe have weird fetishes or have no real goal in life is what I’m assuming?  
That makes sense. He is not super quiet though.

People always like to make judgements. Is this a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' type of thing or is being quiet inherently disadvantageous?

That's awesome! Great for you, you've made a new friend, made his work life easier, AND you're getting into shape!  I'm sure he put so much effort into your workout plan because you put effort into getting to know him. You both sound like really great people  
Thanks for the comment!  I definitely hope that he appreciates me as much as I appreciate him... Because I appreciate him a lot!  
Tell him that! As my mom says, kindness doesn't cost us anything but it can change a person's day/life.  
I have  told him a few time. Definitely don't want to be to weird but I'll keep. It in mind to mention it more!

Thanks!  I definitely have made my fair share of mistakes in treating people but trying to learn to love and care for people around me. Building the world I want one conversation at a time.  
I feel you. When I was in high school and immature as hell, I used to crack jokes at the expense of others. As cliche as it sounds, I’ve learned to treat people as how I’d like to be treated, and if you’re good to me I’ll one-up you and treat you even better.  
Now if everyone got on board with this what a world we would live in!

Thanks! I have also been struggling with making closer friends this past year but I feel like this may be my lucky break!  
In regards to your later edits, it's even better. I'm a guy turning 40 this year and I've really struggled to make really close male friends. I can't even really quite explain it because I've definitely tried, and it's really hard for guys to really open up with each other and be actually close. And as someone who used to be that kind of weird guy who nobody liked, good on you too!  
For sure. I definitely feel that way as well often! I have some theories as to why that is the case but I believe it is absolutely essential for a satisfying life to have close guy friends. I love my wife deeply but I would argue that just having my wife as a friend would be very unhealthy. I've discovered that most guys do want to be heard and be able to express their feelings but many are systematically raised in a way that negates those opportunities. Thanks for your comment! I definitely appreciate it! I am currently overloaded with notifications as this post blew up but definitely feel free to message me if you want to discuss it further or have any insight! Hope you have a fantastic evening!

I can sorta relate. We have this guy who just can't avoid making simple mistakes every once and while. While seemingly forgetful, he can remember baseball facts like the Red Rox lineup in 1929. He's shit on by nearly everyone at work but always happy and smiling while co-workers avoid talking with him.  Well, one of those coworkers ran into him in Las Vegas randomly at a party (opening of casino or something). This supposedly awkward oddball guy happened to be the life of the party outside of work. Just shows how some people can have an entirely different life outside of work.

Sometimes when you get to know someone, you really learn about them. I’m glad everything worked out well for you and seems like for your new friend too.

"Weird" people often have a unique perspective. Once you get to know them, you see they're probably more genuine than the rest. (Weird, not creepy!)

Why do you think people make fun of him?  
Probably because he is doing yoga in the parking lot, sleeps on top of his car during lunch breaks, and does stretches and yoga in between calls. He also walked through an emergency exit once because he wasn't thinking. Definitely not things to make fun of somebody for but definitely not how mainstream coworkers in offices usually act. I think some people might be a bit intimidated by someone who does not care about looking when and where he exercises.  
I think you hit the nail on the head with this comment. People tend to shy away from others that go against their own short comings.  I.e. they care too much about appearances and aren’t fully themselves. Please stick with your new friend. It sounds like you can both be a great person in each others lives! And awesome on the under 10 mile- that’s amazing!  
Thanks! I thought I was going to die. My heart was racing and I just wanted to quit buy he kept it super casual and kept on motivating me. Normally I wouldn't have made it past the .25 mile marker before giving up. We did a total of 3.1 miles but I was so happy for the consecutive one mile part!

Have you asked why he sleeps on top of his car? That's the only part of the story that confuses me. At my previous job I would spend half my lunch break napping in my car most days.  
Maybe it lets him stretch out? I have no idea and picturing it makes me chuckle, I adore people who give zero fucks.

Hey! You two seem like real nice people :) The only reason people make fun of him is because they’re too insecure to do anything that he does, themselves. Don’t worry, you seem to have found someone who doesn’t seem to care about what others think, and is confident about himself. That’s the best someone can ask for 🙈

Sad that people treat him like that  
Agreed! People being demeaning makes me very sad because people are choosing to use energy to be mean. Like what the heck! Why would you do that!

This makes me feel good. I have always been the odd man out and get made fun of because I beat to my own drum and it can really get me down sometimes. Thank you for being that person who is willing to treat others with kindness.

Sounds like a class dude. Both of you. And don’t feel bad about the ten minute mile time. That’s the best I can ever do. I’ve run two marathons and can’t do better than a 10 minute mile. And that’s usually only for mile 1. Go for it. Start with a half and then go for the full. I’m not going to lie, the training sucks, but the race itself can be a blast.

My funniest racism experience in China
China is such a strange place compared to the rest of the world  
It’s a lot different indeed  
Can you tell me more about the dangerous parts? (Fellow black guy thinking about going to China)  
Don't worry, just wear a LeBron jersey the whole time.

Not sure if it’s apocryphal, but a colleague of mine (white guy) once told me a story about not being allowed into a store and having his attention directed to a sign outside of said store, “no whites” or similar. He asked our Chinese colleague about it. He said the store was probably selling shit like black rhino horns and ivory.  Apparently they think all white people are snitches.  Maybe you’d be allowed in as a black guy as long as you also did not identify as western? Anyway the impression I get is that there aren’t really racist “parts” so much as racist homes and racist stores.  Case-by-case stuff.  I could be wrong though.  I’d also like to hear more first-hand experience.

Well in the most dangerous parts you get put in concentration camps for not being chinese  
It’s a lot different indeed

It's 1/5 of humanity, a world of its own.  
Crazy that China and India are basically a third of the world's population.

My funniest racism experience in China
I was stationed in Japan back in the early 90’s and my roomate was a brother.  He comes home late one weekend (we had duty on Monday) and says “Man, you ain’t gonna believe this shit!”  I ask him what he means.  Troy was dating a Japanese local and that weekend was the first time they had been intimate.  Troy tells me that he took his clothes off and she’s staring at him.  He asks her “what’s up?” and, no shit, she asks him where his tail was.  Swear to God, this girl though black folks had tails.  I was fucking blown away.  
...what the fuck  
Yeah...we were both shaking our heads on that one.  
My chiropractor is Jewish and went to med school somewhere in the southern US. He met people who'd never met a Jewish person before, and they wanted to know where his horns were, or to feel his upper forehead to see if the horns were under his hair. This was in the 80s I believe. We have a lot of ignorance at home.

I swear on my children.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  Troy was (is?  We didn’t keep in touch) an awesome dude.  He laughed about it and forgave her ignorance and they dated for a few months.

My funniest racism experience in China
How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment  
For that money, I'm surprised you didn't stick around the Great Wall for a week or hit the other tourist traps. You and photo stall guy could have taken that show on the road and made bank.  Edit: You got any photos of this?  
I just posted it under the story thread 😜

Assuming this guy just worked 2 days a week doing this he'd be making 6 figures. Even if I absolutely hated China I'd probably consider sticking around for a year or so to do that.  
I wouldn’t get that much. You’re forgetting it’s China. Everything is under the microscopic eye. I might have gotten lucky that day but I’m pretty sure that would never happen again. China is not like other countries, you really need to get off the police radar for anything cuz they can be assholes to you for real. But that wasn’t my main reason of leaving. I stayed in China because I had a court dispute with a chinese company and the court demanded that I bring notarized documents from back home(which meant I had to go)

It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment

How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality.

Somewhere on the Great Wall is a photo booth owner who has a story about a random black guy who showed up to his stall and made him bank for a day. I imagine that is more than he makes in a week.

To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment  
How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me.

I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment  
How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down. As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.

This sounds like a more extreme version of what my partner and I experienced in Delhi. We are white, and my partner has long, very blonde hair. In the streets of the city, no one batted an eye lid (except a scammer every two minutes but that's another story). But when we went into the tourist sites, suddenly everyone wanted selfies with us, or were covertly filming. It was later explained to us that people in the tourist sites were likely to be from remote rural villages, and similar to what you said, they had never seen a white person before. I'm sure they had on TV/film, but clearly they wanted a record to show their friends that they had seen an actual white person. Seems we were more interesting to them then Lal Quila!

As I was walking, some really loud teenage girls came up to me and said  “Can you take a photo with us?” I’ve been in China for a year now , and no lie,,this always happens. Not like once. If I’m out all day, at least 3 times a day. Everyday. People want to take a photo with a black guy.  So when the girls asked me, I just ignored them , like I always did and passed them as if I didn’t hear what they said. Trust me! That is not rude at all, it’s just too many of them and one of you. But as soon as i passed the girls, a light bulb kinda lit and I knew what I had to do if I wanted to get out of my sticky situation. And so I made a PLAN that night.  By now, I’ve understood the type of people that want to take photos with the black guy. It’s not the people that are from Beijing. It’s not the people that are coming from big cities.  It’s the people that are coming from all around China, the countrysides. Every chinese has to come to Beijing at some point of their lives. Because most of the historical temples and cultural heritages were in Beijing. That’s when I knew where I was going. I had to go to the GREAT WALL.  It was a 3 hour taxi ride from where I was and I went there as early as I can.  THE MISSION:- Be a photogenic Black guy and make as much money as you can to buy airplane ticket.  I reached the Great Wall around 9 am and already there’s loads and loads of people. My type of people,,the people from the countryside’s.  Five minutes in, people were just taking photos of me without permission.  I needed to make a plan or I’m gonna get played and this is my last chance. I can’t even afford to come back to the Great Wall even if I wanted too and I have to make it count.  From the corner of my eye, I saw a photoshop that was in like a makeshift tent. I went up to him and I decided to tell him my plan.  I spoke a little Chinese but google translate did the rest. I told him what I was trying to do and if he’d like to partner up with me. To my surprise, he was actually enthusiastic about it. And he agreed.   At his makeshift tent, he had old Chinese military General costumes. Sort of like Ghenghis Khan armoury. I then told him that we can make a lot more money if I was to wear one of those military uniforms. He laughed at the idea and even proposed another idea himself. He came up with a writing board and wrote in Chinese characters and he told me that it said  “Take photos with the Black Ghenghis Khan for 25yuan(3-4$) a picture. We got everything,set up, I was by my corner and he was ready with his camera. I was to make 15 yuan and him 10yuan as per our agreement.  That’s when it went all batshit crazy.  People from the whole of  the Great Wall it seemed actually flocked  to take photos with the Black Ghenghis khan. It really got out of control and we had to stop for some time as people got pushy and were shoving each. Other. We needed ORDER. The cameraman had to call up people and we actually hired “security” (just his friends, no need to bs)..and the guys made everyone cue. It really got to the point where police even came and I kinda got scared that I’d be in trouble,, but they used their position as police men to cut the lines and take photos. Had to tell them it was on the house.  We started taking photos at 11am and didn’t have lunch and just stood there posing with so many excited people taking photos with the black guy.  I even did two wedding photos.  By 5 pm , I was done and exhausted Took of the costume and we went into the tent to count the money. Surprise, Surprise!!! After paying the “security “, paying off some of the Great Wall security, and splitting  our shares.. I actually have made the equivalent   1430$  . American DOLLARS.  I  went back to my apartment, washed the curiosity of a billion people off and bought my ticket. I went home the next day.  I am THE BLACK GHENGHIS KHAN!!! Photo is posted on another comment  
How I made money off racism in CHINA I lived in China in 2013 for a year and this is my story.  Being a foreigner in China is one of the hardest things a person go through. Unless you are living in international cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc... it could be very challenging. Whether you are white or black, Chinese people can be in your face and I mean literally come up to u and touch your hair, take a selfie, or do whatever they please without asking your permission.  It’s a bit harsher for black guys cuz the treatment gets really rude. People would come up to you and rub your skin, thinking the black would come off. Or take uncalled for selfies in groups while hugging u without permission. Or start calling you names. The worst one is  when you go into a toilet at a bar and everyone literally wants to look at your cock. So much harassment happens that a person who has lived in China for even as  short as 3 months needs about a month to readjust to normal life. You leave China very rude and you become that because everyone is just a bit harsh and out to get you type of mentality. It really, really gets a bit too much to take at times  that a lot of international students actually get so depressed and some even resort to suicide.  My girlfriend came to visit me and she was supposed to stay for 3 months , but she couldn’t last a full month as people were just touching her hair and some even tried to grope her boobs and non of this is frowned upon, is actually ignored, if you are a foreigner.  The reason this happens is because, I later found out,. because China is so huge, I’ve had people tell me that I was literally the first black guy they’re ever seen in their life and they curiosity gets the best of them..shit like that. And they’re not lying or exaggerating, so many of them never left their villages.  So anyways, about a year into my stay, I had finished all my money, I was going to get kicked out of my apartment cuz of rent, my friends had all left and I was really gonna go Hobo in Beijing and that’s not an option you’d want to take there.  I wanted to go back home but I didn’t have money for air ticket. I checked online and it costed 860$. There was no way I can find 860$ and I had no one to turn too. I had to come up with something. Really quick too. Only 5 days left for me to get kicked out of my apartment.  I tried to play 8 ball pool gambling and I went further down the hole as I lost games and handed over some of my money. I’m left with about 140$. I’m almost like sulking and walking very slowly and very sad with my head down.

I’m guessing you’re white? Did you ask him why?  
Parents complain about it pretty often. I've heard it can make a school look low quality. White women have first pick for any jobs, although there is such a high turn over, its still not that hard to find something if your qualified. Not all schools are like that, but i definitely know some teachers that probably shouldn't be teaching, but get paid more than long term professional teachers. You get used to it though.  
That’s really sad. Good on you for not taking that job.

My brother is Caucasian with wavy/curly blond hair, blue eyes, and he's pretty damn tall. Overall just a big strongly built guy.  He went to China on a school trip & so many people stopped him to ask for photos - totally random strangers. He was a bit weirded out.  
My funniest racism experience in China
When I had an 8 hour layover in Taipei, Taiwan (Amazing city), I really got to experience what it was like being a black guy in a country where there weren't many. After I left a restaurant, this little girl stared at me and pointed me out to her father. I have long dreadlocks and she was making motions around her head while pointing. That family coincidentally ended up following us to the zoo, which you have to take a glass bottom gondola to, and everytime I looked back at her, her eyes were locked onto me and my family. When I got to the top of the mountain, there was some sort of food court with a bunch of different stands preparing food for people. While walking through and seeing what kind of fair food Taiwanese people ate I heard a voice shout at me. "HEY! Black man!" The source of the voice was a man running a stall that served an assortment of fried foods, so I walked over. When I got there, he pointed down at his fryer and with a huge grin said,  "Chicken!" I couldn't hold back my laughter. It was the most entertaining racism I have ever experienced.  
Did you buy his chicken tho  
No, unfortunately I did not. I was traveling with family and we had already gotten lunch. Instead of going to a Taiwanese restaurant, they wanted to go to McDonald's because it'd be easier to order with pictures. Taiwanese McDonald's sells bone-in fried chicken and that's what I got. It was not good, it tasted like crispy grease, and made me sick to my stomach. I wanted to try some but I also wanted to avoid an emergency because I didn't know how to ask "Where's the restroom?" in Taiwanese. :(

Yup, i come from a chinese city and despite living in France for years i got surprised when i saw a black guy casually walking in my hometown. Thing is, China is so closed you don't expect to see strangers at all... So whenever chinese people see strangers they start doing weird things and treating them like animals. Most of them don't even understand what multiculturalism is, and the whole mentality is a few centuries late. I'm sorry they treat you this way, just ignore them!  Merry christmas :)  
Yep that's the way I see it. They're not racist by choice it's more inexperience and curiosity if anything.  If I saw a 7ft tall blue man for the first time in my neighbourhood I'm pretty damn sure I'd stare and maybe even try to get a picture and talk to them.

When I was in China for school, a dude at the Terra Cotta soldiers offered the black guy in our group some terra cotta figurines for a lock of his hair.  
So how many figurines did he get?

My funniest racism experience in China
I had an uncomfortable situation with Chinese visitors at a university where I worked. It was graduation and a celebratory time. When a family came out and started talking to me and my friends I thought it was just happiness from the event. They hugged me and talked with me. It was nice. I DID think it was odd when they wanted a picture with me, but I obliged. It was only later that I realized they wanted a pic with me because I was morbidly obese. I still burn with humiliation over that. My friends and some acquaintances witnessed it, but no one ever mentioned it again. I’ve lost a lot of weight since then, but I’m still very heavy. My job now involves working with the local international population, including those very new to the US, and luckily I haven’t experienced that again. I think I have a better understanding of the cultural basis for it and would handle it much differently. But, God, that was an awful feeling.  
Not totally related but it happened in college and your story reminded me. I was a TA for a bioanthropology class. The other TA was a grad student from China. She was nice and very polite but had not been on the US long. We were discussing possible lab activities to do involving osteology, really basic, fun stuff, as this was an intro level class for mostly non-majors. She, in front of myself, the other TA, and the Professor, suggested we do one where we compare the skills of different human ancestors along with different races, and implied that East Asians, followed by White Europeans are most evolved and that Africans were more "primitive" and closer to our hominid ancestors. Obviously this idea is unscientific and racist, but the Prof had to calmly explain to her how we don't really subscribe to that idea in the West and just how inappropriate it was. The Chinese TA said she understood but seemed skeptical... I believe she also once told me that she believed that East Asians did not originate in Africa from a common ancestor like the other races, but had evolved in parallel somehow. I have no idea how either of these ideas fit into the scientific consensus on modern China, but she accepted them quite casually.

I was trying to catch a taxi on a street corner in Suzhou and a kid came up to me and asked if I speak English. Then he told me hours whole life story, how he had just Arrived in town to start university, the first person in his family to her higher education, so much opportunity in China not like it was for his grand parents in the village or his parents in the factory, on and on for about 15 minutes. Then he goes ‘anyway, your the first foreigner I’ve ever met and I’ve always wanted to ask, how do you manage with that massive nose? Doesn’t it get in the way?’

Sorry to hear about your experience. I'm from China, studying in the states. Honestly it's just that the environment doesn't expose them to people to other races very much. I hope you don't think Chinese people are inherently racist.  
Actually quiet the opposite. I really have good friends that are Chinese and I still have a Chinese business partner. It’s just that Chinese from the countrysides and Chinese from the cities are a lot different. It’s even harder for a chinese from the city to get along with a chinese from the countryside, let alone a black guy like me. And like I said in my story, all this is ignorance and not arrogance mostly. But the problem is , there’s a billion of you and one of me and you can imagine how frustrating it can get when you just want to piss and everyone in the toilet is literally waiting to see the black guys penis.  
LMFAO! Don’t get me started on that. I already have difficulty using urinals or “going” when someone is speaking to me. There was this once that I was in a hurry and tried to use a urinal... I shit you not, I turn around and there were three people trying to look over my shoulder. That was one of my biggest wtf moments there! I was just like, “never mind, I never needed to use the restroom anyways... it’s okay, I can wait until my bladder explodes”  X’’D

Lmao does that actually happen? I've only been to Shanghai and Hong Kong, which are obviously more international so I haven't seen people acting like this. That's hilarious.  
People in Beijing always take photo of you and sometimes they even try to hide it . Shanghai has a lot more tourism and people are "used" to white or black people

I live in northern Europe and it definitely feels "exotic" in a way to see a black person. It's like once in a week usually. 9th grade was an exception because I had a very good Brazilian friend in school.

I saw something similar to this in a Korean vlogger's video. She has really young blasian kids and one time over a year ago, when they visit China, people kept asking her could they take pictures with the kids. I don't remember what she did about it, but it's so weird how people think asking a stranger to take a picture with them because of their race is okay in any country.  
Oh I think I know who you're talking about! Her name is lilypetals I think. These vlogs always show people coming up, getting a friend to take a pic then just walking off without saying a word. It's one thing to not ask for permission, but then to not even say hey/bye/thanks is disgusting. Almost like taking a pic with a statue....

One of my buddies is a ginger( like BRIGHT orange hair) and lived in Hong Kong then Shangai over a period of 4 years. People used to just touch his hair randomly in public, and also got the ‘take a selfie with me’ treatment.  The lack of diversity in a country with over a billion people is crazy.

When I first visited the US and first saw black people, I kept looking for a pretext to get to touch someone's afro. I'm Australian, and was just obsessed at the time, because I had never seen super curly hair before.  
That’s not bad.. the Chinese version of that ,would be to come up to you and rub your skin really hard and rough, expecting to see the black coming off your skin. And they’re doing all this ,like 5 old women circling you and they don’t even ask you for permission(not that I’d want my black to come off😂), they just stop you rudely and start rubbing.. I became a very rude and defensive person after a while.  
Your tolerance must be like top 1% worldwide. Can I ask why are you there? I'd gone mad living among rude people like that.  
You have to be patient if you live in China because everyone disrespects you. I’m not exaggerating here. EVERYONE DISRESPECTS YOU. But the patience wears off and you start becoming rude like them after a while and you won’t even know it. I found out that I had become an angry person after I left China and i really needed some time to get to my old self. I used to have a business partnership with a chinese company and they bailed on me taking everything we worked for and I tracked them and sued them there(it took a whole year),, I won and I got my money in the end...

My roommate from Zimbabwe said she would have crowds following her thinking she was Rhianna. She had an overall bad experience as a tourist traveling with only one friend in the rural parts because of the lack of respect for her physical boundaries.... And yeah, folks trying to rub off her melanin. She also disliked the pissing and spitting in public right next to her table at restaurants.  Unfortunately, she moved to Jersey City, so she can't really get away from THAT.

I talked a teen jumper down from the rail on the bridge 4 1/2 years ago. Today I found him working in a sit-in coffee shop I was trying out since I moved.
I disagree with approaching him directly, since he recognized you but didn't speak to you; he only wrote a note on your receipt -- a way of saying "I know who you are and I've always hoped to thank you but it's too embarrassing/difficult to bring it up and talk about it." Another approach: what if you visited the diner again and sat for a while lingering over coffee -- maybe if you were to say, "It's good to see you," in a non-pressuring way, HE would now initiate a conversation. If he doesn't, that's OK but you haven't pushed.  
"It's good to see you," would be perfect.  
You know, just thinking about this is making me tear up a bit. Just the weight behind the statement.  
I didnt tear up until I read that you teared up.

I agree, I wouldnt start chatting him up about it, but maybe leave a thoughtful message on a card or something for him. Like 'I think about that day from time to time, your life changed mine too, and I'm glad I've been able to see you again. If you ever want to talk, let me know, or if you'd like me to get coffee elsewhere from now on, I'd be happy to oblige.'  
I hope I don't nitpick, but I see two somewhat problematic details in your example and it might be helpful, for you or anyone else. Now I don't write from a scientific point of view but simply someone who have struggled a lot with mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, and who have talked to many in the same situation. (And sorry in advance for bad english, I'm not native english speaker and for some reason this text was harder to write than usual) With that said, the kid wrote on the note "You have no idea how much I think about you and what you did.", don't answer that with "I think about you from time to time" and don't bring up getting coffe elsewhere. Reason being that he might still be struggling with whatever made him want to jump in the first place, and many struggling with these things have a tendency to interpret things more negatively. As an example, a possible reaction to number one is getting sad that you're not thinking as much about it as he does, or bringing up staying away can be read as you not wanting to see him again. I hope this comment isn't seen as negative, I only want to spread awareness about how words can change meaning depending on what you struggle with.  
I disagree with approaching him directly, since he recognized you but didn't speak to you; he only wrote a note on your receipt -- a way of saying "I know who you are and I've always hoped to thank you but it's too embarrassing/difficult to bring it up and talk about it." Another approach: what if you visited the diner again and sat for a while lingering over coffee -- maybe if you were to say, "It's good to see you," in a non-pressuring way, HE would now initiate a conversation. If he doesn't, that's OK but you haven't pushed.  
As a guy who himself went through dark times and wanted nothing but to talk discreetly, one option is to leave an easy contact option on an innocent sticky note: just a Reddit handle or a Snapchat or whatever. Put the ball in his court, it's his move from there

I totally agree. If the young man wanted to speak to his rescuer I would think he would have gone up and spoken to him. Just know you saved his life and he is eternally grateful! ❤❤❤❤❤  
Not necessarily. Many people have trouble initiating any kind of social interaction, but that doesn't mean they don't want it.

It was a public place. He was working. He likely didn’t have the opportunity to stop and have a 10 minute conversation. You are misreading this.  
Thank god someone here said it I'm like wtf is everyone else here crazy of course he wrote it on a receipt everyone raise your hands if tomorrow at work you would have zero issue addressing that one time you almost killed yourself. Also possible employee rules that specifically state no non work related or generally considered negative topic conversations. (They may even include specific language about use of "trigger words") just ask him if you can chat outside of work after a little setup including how he is keep it chill and just know to back off if he seems uncomfortable but let him know you would like to chat. I mean I get it a lot of us here have social issues so we kind of just assume the guys a redditor but guess what maybe he's actually had the sex and just knows since OP is alone they realized they were a redditor so they left the note as they didn't want OP to run out screaming when a human talked to them? (Shh I know OP is actually a caring well rounded person as their post clearly illustrates I'm just kidding around)

How do you know that he knows that the other person wasnt misreading it?

I talked a teen jumper down from the rail on the bridge 4 1/2 years ago. Today I found him working in a sit-in coffee shop I was trying out since I moved.
That was very kind of you to not approach him on it. But as he initiated contact, I would say hello, and ask how he has been.  
100% agree he seems fine with talking to you

This. At this point its almost rude not to.  like he wrote you a nice note you have to at least say hi after that... otherwise he'll think you hate him or think he's weird for saying what he did.  
That was very kind of you to not approach him on it. But as he initiated contact, I would say hello, and ask how he has been.  
I disagree, he left a note even though he could've approached OP. I would understand that as keeping/setting a safe distance.  
I mean, probably didnt want to talk cuz he was at work, ya know? But he remembers him, so, I feel like thats something.  
Yeah you can't really have a long, personal conversation like that while you are at work lol  
I disagree, he left a note even though he could've approached OP. I would understand that as keeping/setting a safe distance.  
I think you may be right but clear communication is never a bad thing. Attempting to talk, but respecting their boundaries if they are not interested, is fine IMO

I talked a teen jumper down from the rail on the bridge 4 1/2 years ago. Today I found him working in a sit-in coffee shop I was trying out since I moved.
How far away did you move? Crazy to think you might've come across each other again 500 miles away.  
I moved to a different part of the city.  
That's still probably at lease 5.00 miles.

I would leave him a note back and say how happy you are to see him again. Maybe talking to him directly could be a little too much, but a note should be okay since he initiated contact.

Chills reading this, I l was in a bad car accident when I was young. Didn’t know the people who stopped to help. But years later I saw them parking down the road at a different shop. I ran and hugged them. It’s strange how the mind remembers. Don’t know if I could pick them out of a line up today but at that moment I just knew it was them. Edit: what I’m trying to say is maybe it took him a minute to recognize you. And when he did he didn’t know how to react. I think you did the exact right thing. PS. It may have taken him a moment to realize who you were. And he may not be ready to talk about what happened that day. Leave it be knowing you are an amazing human and did something so great that day.

If you didn’t want to make him uncomfortable by asking how he was you could just say “It is great to see you!” With the happiest grin possible. Because that’s true. And affirms his choices.

Steps you need to take. 1) Make sure someone you trust knows this is happening 2) Get to a doctor ASAP! Even if it’s a MedExpress or similar.  3) That desire you’re feeling is now enemy number one. Every other struggle is now irrelevant.  4) Know that you are one of us. A silly human on this silly planet doing silly things in silly ways.  I love you.

Still, thinking about it so much must be having a negative effect (I know it did for me). If it's possible, you can try talking about it with a doctor. Maybe they could help figure out possible solutions.

For me there was never a moment that turned me around. Life just kinda did turn around. I think a lot had to do with the pressures of college. But I’m wildly happy I never did it. I got married a few months ago, life’s great, I’m in a good place now. I still have bad days. Honestly lately has been a bit of a slump. But I’m glad I never killed myself those years ago. A lot of life was lived since then I’m glad I was here for.

DO IT! He has been thinking about you for 4 1/2 years! You are his hero. Just be modest and tell him how it made your day to see him doing his thing! Obviously he is in a healthier place if he is taking care of himself and expressing his personality. He intiated contact so I wouldn't say it's out of bounds to say hi, just keep it simple and if he wants to get deeper he will. Someone saved my life 4 days ago and I'm not letting them out of my world

This is heartwarming. Just raise your cup to him and wink next time you get your order. Lowkey acknowledgement. Strangers can be so kind.

What did you say to him to talk him down?  
iirc Something along the lines of:  "Buddy, what'r you doing?" -He was crying. That is what attracted me to his location- Through the sobs, he said some personal stuff I won't repeat.  I asked why was going to use a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I asked him who would be sad about his death. I was pretty much rambling, I didn't even know what to say. I was just talking out my ass. He stepped off, stared at my face for a minute, and walked away. I tried to follow him, but he went into the subway and disappeared.

Thank you so much for what you did. Eleven years ago my 14 year old son hung himself. Not only did you save this boy’s life, but you also saved his parents from the worst psychic pain imaginable.

CONGRATULATIONS!! I'm working on my associates degree for business administration too and people could care less because I'm taking online courses. Oh well, you should be proud of yourself! Good luck to you and your future endeavors!  
As long as the university is accredited, who cares if it's online?  
My thoughts exactly.

Old people who think if you dont have to struggle to be in person and not use a computer means it was "too easy". Grumpy bastards.  
Distanced learning is actually much, much harder for most people.  Not only do you not get direct feedback from classmates or professors, there's really no way to tell comparatively (to other students) how you're doing in the class or not.  I go through entire CPA modules not knowing how I'm doing until after I know how difficult the exam was or wasn't.  The psychology of this is exhausting.

I’m doing my associates online too and no one cares either, which is kinda funny because I’ve done college in person and online and I’ve actually found online to be much more challenging. But from one online person to another, I’m proud of you! Keep pushing!!

Congratulations. I’m kinda jealous as I’ve had to put school on hold myself and would like to go back someday.

Got hearing aids today and cried because my cat purred
It is one of the best sounds. The sound of a content animal. May you have many more sonic revelations.  
Thanks! I've had a few sonic revelations today, from trying to figure out what that clicking sound was in my car (the turn indicator) to hearing paper towel rip. It's been an emotional day!  
Did you lost your hearing at 21 and never heard a turn indicator of a paper towel before?  
When you don’t hear something for a long time, you forget. You get used to not hearing things. It’s not really about the specific sound - it’s the experience of being able to HEAR it. At first, all of the sounds of everyday life can be surprising, or even startling, and then delightful, because you CAN HEAR IT.  Think of it this way. How many times a day do people use their turn indicator, or paper towels? How many days a week, month, year? Daily, probably many times a day. Mundane. But if you did those things on mute for a decade, you’d get used to them that way. No sound, just like everything else. You’d get used to the turn signal being the flashing light only, the paper towel being only the texture of tearing it (ripping things with perforations is distinctive, even without hearing it), the cat being only the shape of the mouth when meowing, or the vibration against you when they cuddle up. That’s your normal.  And suddenly, there is an entirely new dimension. Maybe you’ve experienced it before, but if you asked me to remember anything that was typical and mundane when I was 20, I couldn’t tell you. I can’t remember the specific way my car’s turn indicator sounded. I can’t even remember using it, although I know I did. If my last time hearing a paper towel tear had been that year, I wouldn’t remember it now. Things fade with time, so when it happens again, it’s new and startling and you’re not used to it; that doesn’t normally happen! Wonder is abundant when you’ve lost a sense and then get it back. 🥰

For the car, do you mean the click-click-click sound you hear when you turn the ignition just before the engine starts? I believe that is the sound of the spark plugs firing to get the engine going. I'm quite deaf myself and I don't think I was able to hear it properly until I got my most recent set of hearing aids. The technology has improved a great deal over the past decade.

Give your good kitty pets for me, what a touching story  
Aww thank you. I'm still in disbelief. I had no idea cats made that sound. My heart is pounding because it's so much to take in. I had no idea cats did that and it's just such a sweet sound.

My cat makes a quiet little sign/meow when she relaxes. Like someone going 'ahh' when they take their shoes off after a long day, but in cat trill form. It's very cute.

Got hearing aids today and cried because my cat purred
Have you heard a purr/ meow yet? Those are my favorite!! Also keep an ear out for the purring even when he isnt getting pets. My old cat could be heard purring as she walked down the hallway towards my room to get on the bed and snuggle. Purring just from the excitement of knowing she was about to get some good snuggles. I feel like hearing the purring adds to the emotional connection I make with my cats. I know they are enjoying something and that makes me enjoy it too.  
Wait, what's a purr/meow? They can do both together? I'm sobbing again. I'm still trying to understand that purring isn't just a vibration thing they do and that it has a noise too. You're saying they can purr and meow at the same time? Do they still vibrate? I'm literally mind blown right now.  
I'm not sure how to describe it. If you go on youtube and lookup "cats talking to each other" there is a video of a black/white cat and a white/tabby sitting next to each other literally going back and forth with meows and purr meows. I would link the video but my husband is sleeping next to me and I dont want to accidentally wake him up.

This made me so happy, I’m so glad for you!  
Thank you. I keep crying and feel so silly. It was so overwhelming and I'm still trying to process the sound. It's like my brain hasn't made the connection yet but my heart just knew that was his purr.

Just wait until you hear tree leaves flutter in the wind.  
And I'm sobbing again. I haven't even thought about that sound in years. I wonder how long it's been since I heard leaves rustling.

I work in music and sound design and hearing loss is one of my constant fears. This story makes me happy. There’s so much more to hear and notice now! Edit:  -I have thought about this all day and I have come up with a few sounds that I really enjoy.  -When you step in snow a day after its fallen -When the snow starts to melt off of the branches as it gets warmer it kind of trickles down all around you -There is a type of sand like in Sarasota Florida and it kind of has a rubbery sound when you step on it -Letting the steam out of a iron, or when you coffee is brewing and bubbling -Bacon sizzling or then you open in egg onto a hot pan.. shhhhhhhhss -Definitely a small stream, or river is a favorite of mine -Putting your ear to someones chest and hearing their heart as well as their stomach making weird sounds -The wind whistling -The birds tweeting -Pouring a hot cup of tea (believe it or not they have done studies and people can hear if water is cold or hot when being poured) -Stepping in leaves in fall -A campfire is an amazing sound! -Sissors cutting through paper -Very slowly tearing paper -Walking on wet gravel or tires driving on wet gravel -Ocean Waves -When you put ice in a beverage and they start to crack -Walking on ice as it cracks (not on a lake but a puddle) -Cats purring for sure -Flipping the pages of a book -Cracking the spine of a book -Fluffing your blanket in in the air so its opens an lands on your bed (cats like this too) -An old wooden door or old latches -Cutting an apple, also most food sounds are great -Matches striking is great -Someone inhaling a cigarette or smoking a cigar, that kind of sizzle -Rain on a windshield -Certain zippers on a jacket sound great -Wind quietly blowing through grass I feel like from your post it is probably sounds that are low in frequency and in volume that will stand out to you. Like purring. Which was hard for me to think of sounds that are specific to that range. If you every want to hear a specific sound you can dm me. I have tons of recordings.  Also to others, I am very careful with my hearing and always have some hearing protection with me.  
Thank you! I can only wear them for about thirty minutes at a time before I get too overwhelmed because everything has a sound. It’s like I can see the space around me, but with my ears.

I don’t know where you live, but one of my favorite sounds is fully leafed trees blowing in the wind. The rustle sound. If it’s winter there like where I am it’s something you can look forward to this summer 😊

It takes some time until your mind learns how to properly interpret  the change in audio input. The mind uses the input from the ears to map what is, and what happens, around you. With the boost from hearing aids, your mind needs to adjust how it maps. When I got my first hearing aids, I was constantly surprised that something I thought was right behind me turned out to be several meters away when I turned to look. So there was a mismatch between what my ears and my ears told me, and this was a cause of confusion and dizzyness. It will pass in a few days, if you wear the hearing aids at all times (except when sleeping or showering etc). In the meantime, take it easy. Sit down when the world threatens to start spinning. If it does not pass, the hearing aids should likely get adjusted. In my case it was 2-3 adjustments (with several weeks for acclimatisation in between) before they worked well. That being said, I too was moved to tears several times back in the day...when I got home from getting the hearing aids, and birds were singing. When I first listened to music after getting them. Good luck, and don't give up on the hearing aids just because it takes time to adapt!

Don't go too loud for long periods of time. Use ear protection/earplugs, the newer ones automatically adjust the sound level. Regular checkups (2-3 times a year, maybe more often because of your profession) at your otorinolaringologist.  Also, avoid sudden bursts of loud noise. I was at a historical festivity this last weekend and noped the fuck out when I saw firing cannons was involved.  
 otorinolaringologist  Say what now  
That’s gonna he an ear, nose, and throat doctor. The hearing test will usually be an audiologist, however.

If your cat sees birds from a window sometimes they chirp ! It’s like a repetitive short meow sound , I recommend trying to see if your cat does it or looking for a video online !!  
My daughter says he chirps all the time! I've never heard it, but I'm looking forward to listening to it tomorrow!

Fun fact: Cat purrs have a scientifically proven healing effect.  
That's so awesome! My brother is going to bring over a Tibetan singing bowl for me to listen to for the same reason. I'm so nervous to hear one!

I remember when my mum got her cochlear implant and she couldn’t believe all the sounds she was hearing, even the sound of a car indicator. She thought it just flashed. I’m so happy for you. ❤️  
Haha I definitely did that when I got in the car to leave the audiologist. I looked around for a minute trying to figure what that clicking noise was, then I realized it was the turn signal!

My 15 yr old cat's purr is therapy for me. It's like the most intimate moment you can share with him, and it demonstrates purr love. So happy you get to experience it now dear friend.

I'm deaf from the beginning of my life, and I just want  to know how real ears hear. (15M)  
This is a really interesing statement, and I am going to *try* to describe some everyday sounds using non-sound words. The rustle of fabric (like when you pull a shirt on, or move the blankets on your bed): It's a warm sound; like being by a fireplace or when you get that rush of air out of the oven. It sounds like the way a wave looks as it slumps into the wet sand. It's the sort of noise you hear all the time but don't pay attention to - sort of like how you don't pay attention to the concrete on the footpath. It makes your brain feel like it's actually being caressed itself, the sound so unimposing that it just is happening without you realising, and when you do think about it, it's very comforting. The sound of a happy laugh: This one is intoxicating. Even more so if it's someone you love that is laughing (bonus if you've made the joke they're laughing at). It sounds like fizzy coca-cola, like your body is being dipped in warm butter. You get sparks in your brain like looking at amazing artwork or eating chocolate. It's like someone rubbing your head with a balloon and you're getting static electricity, but in your ears. The sound of fireworks: Each firework makes its own sound, to be fair. Some sound like when you get a shock from the car door - just small but it gives you a jolt. Some are full-on all body BANGS like if someone sneaks up behind you and gives you a fright. Some make a long noise at first, like the feeling of a finger running down your arm, finishing in a gentle but hard pinch. It's very exciting to hear them, but I promise seeing them is far better. ​ I hope someone else can provide better descriptions of sounds, but that's my attempt at three. :)  
I have hearing aids, so I hear most of these sounds :) I don't know if there is a word for in English, but without hearing aids I hear very little sounds

This is adorable :) Also, thank you for your service  
I feel like I should get a tee shirt that says, "six years in the military and all I got were these hearing aids" haha. Kidding of course. Thanks for the comment!  
You will get so much joy in the coming days, weeks, months..........  My dad is a vet, he got hearing aids, when he walked out of the VA....... He says, “Oh wow, I can hear the birds chirping!” So sweet! But does he wear them? No. Sadly, no. He says they hurt his ears, and whine, and he’s a stubborn old fart. Set in his ways. You have to yell at him on the phone so he can hear, and his tv is always on blast level. But I love him. Lol I’m so happy for you! Thank you for your service and sacrifice! We got a kitten a while back, and I’ve never had a cat before, so I totally understand that! Lol What a sweet happiness. Listen to see if you can hear your children’s heartbeats. Or tummy growls. Pressed against them. Just so happy for you!

Can he go back and get them refitted? If they hurt his ears and they whine, is that normal? I can’t imagine wanting to wear that myself.

This is so sweet!! I’m hard of hearing and wear hearing aids in both ears. I had a similar experience when I got my first pair! I kept hearing tires hitting the pavement while my parents were driving or when I heard rain for the first time  and it was a whole new world! Different sounds will continue to amaze you, enjoy it!  It’s such a cool experience! So exciting 💕  
Thank you! I've been amazed at quite a few sounds I didn't know I was missing. I forgot when you rip paper towels they actually make a rip sound. I heard the fan in the living room. I can hear the clock above my desk ticking. Turns out I have no idea how to whisper. My own voice sounds so strange. Consonants sound strange. The water running in tub when I was giving my kid a bath sounded so loud. I can't wait to hear more tomorrow!  
Oh my goodness!! I relate so much! I’m TERRIBLE at whispering 😂 honestly hopeless with it. I remember I heard certain frequencies more than I did before, so, I could hear the air conditioning fan but not the microwave. It’s such a cool sound experience to figure out!!

This is the cutest thing I've read all week. I'm getting secondhand happiness over here. Just wait until you hear him "chitter" when he sees a bird outside or make little squeaky or snoring noises while he sleeps. Absolutely adorable.

You started losing your hearing at 21 and never heard a cat purr before then? EDIT: Never owned a cat before either. It seems crazy that you had never heard a cat purr in your life until now. You never heard it in a tv show or movie? Nothing on youtube? Never? I'm sure you had a sweet moment but color me skeptical about the details.

It's literally called Orangered. It's been that way for years, there is no debate.  The logo background is Orangered (FF4500, PMS 172 C), Reddit’s primary brand color, chosen for its vibrancy & distinctiveness.   
Team Orangered (vs Perriwinkle) was one of Reddit's april fools many years ago, as well.  Not gonna brag but you can see it on my profile.

Idk that looks darker than the upvote button color  
You can find the color in DevTools if you are using Chrome for example. Right click on an upvoted upvote arrow > inspect > Find tab 'computed' next to 'styles', then you'll see the exact color ( in RGB probably, in this case it is RGB 255, 69, 0 ). You can also use it to find which fonts are used on any webpage for example  
The first question is what we're actually talking about when we say "the upvote arrow." Are we talking about the upvote button on the original reddit design (old.reddit.com) or on the redesign (reddit.com)? Because they're different colors. Here are the original arrow and the new arrow, side-by-side (old on left, new on right). Next, which part of the arrow? It's not a single solid color. Here's a blown-up view of the previous side-by-side. Let's assume that we're talking the color at the very heart of the arrow. For the old design, that's #ff8b60. For the new design, that's #ff4500.   So the new design is absolutely orange red, agreed.   The old upvote button, on the other hand, isn't orange red. So what color would we describe #ff8b60 as? According to the Color Name & Hue Picker the hue is "Orange" and the color is:    Atomic Tangerine

People used to always call it "orangered." I haven't seen the term as much in the past few years, and instead an increasing amount of debates over whether it's orange or red. What happened to the peace and knowledge we once had? Orangered is the "official" term anyway, when they divided for April Fools some years ago it was orangered and periwinkle.  
It is exactly orangered, and I should know because I have an eyedropper colour picker tool I use in Chrome. https://imgur.com/a/ogWEOjy

While it looks closer to orange than red to me I think it’s a shame that they didn’t go full red because we are on REDdit  
Fun Fact, before we used the word "orange", we called it "Geoluread" -- pronounced 'Yellow-Red'.

It looks red when brightness is set to low.  There, mystery solved.  
Holy shit just tried that and you’re right!! When I saw this post I thought that there’s no way anyone could think it’s orange but then, after reading this comment, I turned up my brightness and it really did look orange to me for the first time. Thanks!

I thought this was well known; the upvote is orangered, and the downvote is periwinkle. (team periwinkle for life)  
I want you to know two things.   I’m team periwinkle I thought ‘orangered’ was a made up Reddit word like the past tense of the verb to make something more orange than it was previously, as if a single upvote rendered a post orange, a second would make it oranger. And then ‘oranger’ was Reddit hq slang for updooting. And finally they would say “did you see how I orangered (orange-urd) that post?”

No, he's the guy who insults everyone in the universe in alphabetical order at the beginning of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

The Problem with Immortality
I believe there was a Twilight Zone? with this theme. The guy made big plans. He was going to become a better painter then DaVinci. A better musician than Bach. A better author than Shakespeare. He had all the time in the world to hone his skills. But he mostly procrastinated and never did anything. Because he had all the time in the world.  
There is another Twilight Zone episode that I saw recently about immortality. A hypochondriac man made a deal with the devil to be immortal and invincible. He got himself hurt in all sorts of ways (like getting hit by a bus and a train) and collected the compensation money. He wanted to see if the electric chair, aka the death sentence, would do anything to his body, plus by now he was super bored with life without pain, as he was a hypochondriac before and his health was all he cared about. So he killed his wife. He wanted to be sentenced to death, but was instead sentenced to life in prison because the lawyer was good at his job. He knew his life would never end and couldn’t bear the idea of an immortal life in prison, so he got the devil to come back and thus his soul was now the devil’s.  Very interesting take on immortality. In this episode, it focused more on boredom being what broke him. Since there was no end to life, he basically had nothing to life for. I haven’t seen the episode you described but I love the Twilight Zone and probably will someday!

This was freaking cool to think about  
Incidentally, $1 at 5% interest for 1000 years would give you a total of $1,546,318,920,732,876,472,320.00. After the first 100 years you'd only be at $131.50 but after that it really starts to snowball. (Assuming no other fees, not counting for inflation or the various ways in which doing this would destroy civilization etc.)

Interesting fact, several central banks in very stable countries like Germany are starting to pay negative interest. If that seems strange, it's because of a phenomenon like the one this story hints at. If you have more people willing to invest than people willing to borrow, then you need to pay banks to hold your money in a secure spot. Banks can only offer interest if they are earning money as well. In the case of our immortal hero, he needs to pay someone to maintain his money for him (assuming currency and civilization as we know it continues to exist after 1000s of years).  For me the most interesting part of the story is what he does once the basics are covered. If you didn't have to work, and had done everything cool in the world, what would you dedicate your life to? Religion? Politics? Breeding on a mass scale? Trying to get humans into space to preserve our race forever?  
Even getting to space only delays the inevitable, and not by long in the grand scheme of things.

The Problem with Immortality
I would try to research "The cure of death" and maybe i wont be the only inmortal here.  
Death is not a disease. It is your body not recreating itself as effectively over time. So perhaps you could make yourself live longer but that does not mean you can't get hit by a car and survive when you walked out the lab with your solution to aging.  
Yeah but since you’re already immortal that means that there has to be some scientific way of recreating that.  
Does there? It could be magic. It's a thought experiment about an impossibility.

The Problem with Immortality
I remember reading this a while back,  and i think my answer to it remains the same as ever.  It'd be worth the boredom to get to see where humans eventually go.  Do we expand into the rest of the solar system? Do we restructure earth to a saveable point? Do we attempt inter system travel for colonization? Do we make it at all? We'll probably never know, and to me thats worse than eventually floating in space as an insane goober. Edit: I just wanna say that there's a remarkable amount of people who take issue with what I want or dont want in this imagined scenario. Yall are repeating the same things. Yeah,  infinites a long time. Oh well,  its better than being straight dead and nonexistant anymore.  
It is scary to think we will never know the future. We can reach so far into the past and learn such minute details, but we can never know anything beyond our own lifespan. It's a shame really I'd really like to know where this is all going.  
Best bet? Simulation theory. When we die we unplug the controller and just are a bunch of bored, fourth dimensional, beings. After all wouldn't playing life be boring if you knew it was a game?  
 After all wouldn't playing life be boring if you knew it was a game?  Damn, that sounds like a tail twist ending line from a movie. But again if you play a game where you don't know that it is a game, then you would live your life as you would in real life and then there is no point of playing in the first place. Unless this fourth dimensional world is inherently more boring than a third dimensional one.

I disagree. If I knew if life was a game I'd do crazy shit. I'd be fucking crashing cars into shop fronts and robbing banks and shit. Pure take a load of drugs and go skydiving. That would be much better.

The real problem is, if the universe destroys itself and is reborn again, which is a theoretical possibility, you would witness this happen to humanity, then you would forget it happened after several iterations of the universe without humans, then eventually you would get to see it happen again, except by then you won't have memory pf concept of caring about humans. This will happen an infinite number of times.

Honestly I would quite like it if the universe recreated itself but different after a 20-30 billion years and I was immortal. It means I could never run out of new stuff to find and do.

Dont forget that after eons and eons later, every star will become a red dwarf, then turn into a black or brown dwarf. The universe will become dark filled with black holes and black dwarfs with no air to breath. If you touch a black dwarf, you will get trapped into an eternal gravitational pull.  
Eventually the heat death of the universe will cause all matter to reach equilibrium. Thus the entire universe will be a uniformly dense soup. Except you, you immaculate human sized and shaped anomaly. You will cause minute amounts of chaos, interrupting the immense grey soup of the universe ever so slightly. Eventually you might cause enough change, amd enough of a butterfly effect that a new universe develops. Look at you, you instigator you :)

It would be nice if it worked like that, but it doesn't. The universe is expanding at an exponential rate. That means that eventually every single particle will be moving away from every other particle so fast that it is physically impossible for them to ever come into contact. In the end, all that will be left is an innumerable multitude of particles accelerating ever faster away from each other, destined to never come into contact with anything ever again, leaving the universe an utterly cold, dark, and lonely place where time is meaningless because nothing ever happens, and keeps on happening, forever.  
The Problem with Immortality
This is exactly why I am afraid of immortality; I am already dreading life for the next 30, 40 years due to how the world is like currently and how connected we are as a single planet. There are days that I wished the world would end like the movie 'Finding A Friend For The End of The World', literally no salvation. It is interesting to see how people react differently to such news and honestly, it is not a bad way to go.  
Same here. I don't do very much research, but there is quite a few catastrophic events that can happen within the next 30+ years, give or take a few maybe. I live in an area that's apparently overdue for an 9.0 earthquake that'll for sure kill me or at least leave me injured and I can't bring my mind around as to why people keep moving here. Lol We also have a few volcanoes that will likely blow their tops during this supposed earthquake. One of them is active and quite close to where I live.  That and Yellowstone is bound to explode within my lifetime and it's only like three states away from me. A few people have told me that the eruption can cause enough significant damage to wipe out thousands upon thousands of people, but who knows.  If I'm gonna die from some apocalyptic event, I just hope it's quick and I hope my family goes quick too. Shit is scary to even think about. EDIT: The Yellowstone part was wrong. It is not going to explode anytime soon. Please stop correcting me. Lol  
 If I'm gonna die from some apocalyptic event, I just hope it's quick and I hope my family goes quick too. Shit is scary to even think about.  Exactly the thing I was thinking about; my friends joked about this and called it 'Bringing Down An Empire'. I quite like the naming.

Bound to explode in your lifetime? Bruh. It happens once every 600,000 years on average. Assuming you live to age 80, there’s a 0.013% chance of it happening in your lifetime. It’s far more likely that it won’t explode in your lifetime. It doesn’t matter that it’s “overdue.” That’s not how volcanoes (or earthquakes) work. It’s random. There’s a 1/600000 chance this year, 1/600000 chance next year, (599000/600000)80 in an average lifetime. You’re far more likely to die in the climate wars.

I see you have also read hitchhikers guide  
And Dracula.  
I bring it up because of the method by which the hypothetical attained immortality, which is eerily similar to a character in the hitchhikers guide who has devoted his eternity to insulting every living being in the universe in alphabetical order  
It's a direct quote actually.  The rest is original, but that line about the particle accelerator, the rubber bands and the liquid lunch is a direct homage to Douglass Adams.  
The Problem with Immortality
Who is to say I’m the only one who is immortal? 7 billion on this planet. No telling how many people (species) are on other planets. And I’m the only one who is immortal? I call b.s.  
Girl what you sayin? That all of the (immortal) life in the universe happens to be where you stand?  
What an enormous coincidence that would be, so you see what I’m saying?  
I CAN'T HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING  
I CAN'T HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING  
Girl what you sayin? That all of the (immortal) life in the universe happens to be where you stand?  
They’re saying that at the end whoever is immortal will be all alone floating around in cold space. What if someone else is immortal and we didn’t know till then. The immortal person wouldn’t be alone after all.  
Eventually, the immortals will drift together towards their collective center of gravity creating a slowly growing planet of immortals. Immortals lost to apathy will sink to the core of Immorta while the most sane/stubborn/crazy/powerful will eke out an existence, struggling to stay on top of the writhing surface of immortals who seek to drag them down and supplant their position of freedom, and striking a balance between eons of wisdom and a distinct lack of resources that aren't byproducts of the other immortals beneath them. This is now the setting for your next DnD time travel adventure. The land of Immorta has no external light source and no natural resources or features in the traditional sense. It is a roiling world of darkness spotted by small regions where powerful immortals have managed to control those beneath them and tap them for various sources of energy and materials. Some may use alchemy to produce new materials from the secretions of their subordinates. Others may bend all nearby to their will and use them directly as surfaces, structures, fixtures, and appliances. All surfaces not modified by a powerful immortal are active living bodies and are therefore considered difficult terrain.  
They’re saying that at the end whoever is immortal will be all alone floating around in cold space. What if someone else is immortal and we didn’t know till then. The immortal person wouldn’t be alone after all.  
And what if there is someone else who is immortal, and in the deep dark emptiness of the end of time you find each other.  Two beings, alone amongst the entire universe, and the other person is an absolute prick.

Never played Warhammer but the concept you mentioned is fascinating. You or anyone else have an ELI5 plot summary?  
I'm really rough on 40k, but I'll give it a shot. 40k refers to the 401th millennium, like 2k=2000 refers to the 21th millennium, now. So far far in the future. So humanity's expanded among the stars, but there's this thing called the Warp, which is kind of like space, but also imagination. Like, that's where your soul is. And there's demons in the Warp, that can attack you, and Evil Gods, too, that go and corrupt people, and get evil cultists around them. At some point, the Warp became much closer to reality, I think the barrier thinned? So magic kind of stuff is possible, but there's nothing good in the Warp, only evil gods and demons, and temporarily people when they travel through the Warp. So it starts to break down advanced human society. (I think this is 30k stuff?) So this guy comes about, the God-Emperor, and goes on a crusade saving tons of human colonies through space, giving back order. After he's done with that, he goes back to Earth, but kinda half dies or something. So his corpse sits on his throne, with his soul protecting everyone through the Warp. So cultists can accurately say he's dead, and mindfuck people, but believers can believe in him, which protects them. And since the evil gods are real, a similar thing exists with the God-Emperor, in that all of humanity believes in him to stave off their own corruption. Human society still kinda degrades, though. Everyone is more or less religious fanatics of him, with the techies believing in a Machine God (who they've doublethinked themselves into believing that the Machine God is also the God-Emperor, to unify those groups). But the techies don't really know what they're doing. They're more like mages trying random shit and praying to machines and sometimes getting stuff to work. The God-Emperor's sons do stuff. I think one of them becomes corrupt or something. Certainly, though, they all can do better, because everything's kind of a shit show. Life basically sucks for everyone, and Inquisitors have free reign, and torture people and shit, but it's better than the alternative of the evil gods corrupting everything. Though some of the Inquisition are secretly working for dark gods. There's Space Marines, who've altered their bodies in some crazy ways to be super powerful. There's the Eldar, who are kind of like Space Elfs, I think, and they created their own shitty god, or something? Of course, since they have a closer connection to the Warp, and thus can do magic, they're kinda fucked up. There's space Orks, which kill all their enemies, do weird magic techy things, and survive through sheer stubborn stupidity. There's other shit, too. Basically, the entire fucking universe sucks, but the least sucky thing is to worship the God-Emperor. But that still sucks. Anyone want to correct me or improve my explanations?  
Singular correction  emperor "died" killing one of sons to save humanity and is now kept alive by a fuckton of things on his throne and what not  Singular improvement  Orks can literally will something into existence to an extent if enough of them believe in it (i.e. red vehicles go faster)

So my understanding of immortality is that you won't die naturally, but you can still be killed. Kinda like a vampire.  Why do you see it differently

That's the immortality I want. Eventually I'd be content and ready to go, "I experienced it all and am confortable with the idea of death, even if it's non existence"

I've never really been convinced by this argument because humans are terrible at conceiving time as well as their own mortality. I don't see how they'd be any different if immortality were involved. Seems to me the routines of life would seem no different than they do now. Life already feels infinite given the way our brains work.

Beautiful story. But yeah, remember how the  "witches" in medieval England were dealt with? This case will be much , much worse. People will try to kill you, but since you can't die, they'll probably tear apart your body parts, one by one, until you pass out due to excruciating pain. When you wake up, you can't do anything forever until someone beyond jealousy puts you back together. Maybe I exaggerated, but not by much. That's what I think will happen when you have something that nobody has, and especially since you can cheat the system like investing money in banks. Otherwise, you will be a guinea pig for scientists and they will try to replicate your DNA, and by genetic engineering, everyone will be immortal in a few years. Thanks for reading my comment   
I was going to raise a similar point. Even without other people trying to get at your body. OP memtioned hang gliding and cocaine, but even if you can't die, would you suffer injuries? If so, you could easily be crippled for life. Just a head. Or a brain detached from spinal cord and eyeballs and everything else. If no injuries, what about pain? Not being able to feel pain would also lock you out of a lot of things, from spicy food to BDSM. Also if no injuries, what separates injuries from good modifications of your body, like working out or eating healthier? Are you essentially stuck in your current body? And everyone seems to agree that emotions/mental state aren't affected--pain on losing family, etc.--so you could well be traumatized, or flat out insane like lots of people have mentioned already.

Problems I see with every argument  "You'll have to watch everyone you love die." I'm going to do that anyway.  "You'll be alone." How? If immortality is possible all I have to do is replicate it, and if it is possible then it's likely happened before. Am I truly the only immortal being in all of existance? "You'll float in space forever." Sure, I might. The more likelihood is eventually I'd find my way to another planet. Even if painfully slow. The smart thing to do would be to build a house in space. Keep all my stuff and journals there. Or find a new planet. If I'm the only immortal in all of existance then aliens might find me fascinating.  "You'll slowly forget things over time." Journals are a thing. Plus again, I'm going to (and already have) do that anyways. "You'll still be there in the dark forever and ever." For all we know death is the exact same thing. And eventually my mind would crack and I would go into a coma like state. Just lost in my memories of what used to be.   I'd still want to be immortal.  
 Sure, I might. The more likelihood is eventually I'd find my way to another planet. Even if painfully slow.  Painfully slow being billions of years. One couldn't even imagine what that would do to a human mind.

journals would be impractical, and technology is fragile over time. you would still be conscious, at least partially, because you cannot shut down. replication is only a possibility. this whole idea will always be a contentious theory, at least until proven or disproven

As an actual Deaf person, you're lying through your teeth. This post is disgusting.  Deaf people struggle to get accessibility - yet this person is from a third world country & speaks perfect English? Not only that, but articulates it in such a poetic beautiful way? A deaf person with NO sound, limited resources, and so on knows perfect English? Deaf ppl in AMERICA struggle with English - due to lack of accessibility in the classroom/at home. I've had hearing aids my whole life. My hearing aids got lost once, and I was without them for a few months (last year). When I got hearing aids again, it was extremely overwhelming and hard to adjust back to being able to hear clearly again. Sensory overload. Yet this person, who "never heard a single thing in their life," can pop on a hearing aid & is totally cool? You can't lose your fucking hearing on a jet plane ride. This person explains it well. You need residual hearing in order to benefit from a hearing aid. You need an audiologist to adjust your hearing aids in a way that benefits you and your level of hearing. You cannot just pop on a random free hearing aid and be able to magically hear all of a sudden. "I wish I could talk to you guys via voice chat to hear everyone although I'm sure I wouldn't be able to make out what you're saying." A deaf person who has never heard sound would not be able to speak. I have some hearing, and I had to go to speech therapy for years to learn how to speak clearly. Even with speech therapy I still struggle with certain sounds/words. Someone with NO hearing would more likely benefit from a cochlear implant - which requires surgery & extensive therapy/speech therapy to adjust to. Another comment that explains this well.  ​ This post is incredibly false & it's disgusting someone would fabricate such a lie for internet clout. Edit: I’m sorry to those who were manipulated into spending your actual money on this false post.  Also, I wanted to add that being Deaf is my reality, this is fiction.

I’m more interested in you telling us what you find by yourself exploring YouTube , maybe trying different genres of music and how they impact you.    If I could make a suggestion it would be to keep your listening broad .  
For now, I'm overwhelmed with emotions. Every time I played a clip on YouTube, it's like I tasted a new juice or a dish I had never eaten before. Most of them didn't give me any feeling except the confused feeling but whenever I listened to Michael Jackson songs, I got goosebumps (and sometimes I get scared) and I felt like my eyes could see more clearly. I will definitely keep you guys updated.

Damn dude, this made me tear up for you. I am so happy for you honestly, music is a beautiful thing.  Honestly dude, just take it slow and take in the world around you as sounds can really change your perspective of the world. Don't rush into it, as this new sensation of hearing can overwhelm you.  But dude, i am happy for you. :)  
Thank you. All I know is the song sounded really pleasant and it calmed me down. It was overwhelming at first and I didn't know how to process it but it eventually started giving me emotions I never knew existed. I am not sure how to describe it.  A local pub near us has a piano and I pressed the keys. Every key evoked a new emotion. Didn't know I had been missing out this much.  
Give it some time for your mind to adjust to this new sensation after all you are experiencing a new side of the world.  Soon you will be discovering a new side of yourself.  
I hate to break it to you, but OP is lying. This is an elaborate lie.  I work in audiology research, and this isn't how hearing works. At all. For one thing, there's no hearing disorder which results in total hearing loss, which can be caused by a "jet plane ride", and which can be cured by a hearing aid. Hearing aids don't magically grant hearing to people who are profoundly deaf - they boost residual hearing. Seriously, I can't believe nobody has bothered to look this up. Hearing aids don't work unless you have some degree of residual hearing. Nothing about this story makes the tiniest bit of sense, but you don't have to believe me, just look up how hearing aids work. It's pretty gross that this person has written such a flowing, beautiful post, received loads of awards and compliments, and is lying through their teeth. /u/lazylizardleech, wanna explain yourself? Edit - I have to add this last little detail, it's just too funny. OP is a brand-new account, and they've only posted in three subreddits. This one, /r/changemyview, and... /r/PsychologicalTricks.

Music is the perfect way to create a certain emotion, this emotional experience you can get just by listening to a song is addicting for me. If you feel sad you can play your favorite sunny, feel-good music and that will fix a lot. When studying for a long time, listening to harder music is the perfect study-break. I am not here to suggest certain songs. Install the app Spotify, available on PC and all mobile devices. Browse around the 'search' tab and try listening to some different genres. There will be genres you like more than others, the once you like are the most important. Shuffle around some playlist, discover artist with nice voices, like Michael Jackson, and listen to some more of his songs.  To add emotional experience to certain types of music try watching more movies. You get to know what sad music of happy music sounds like. Now go listen to music, to the cars, birds and airplanes outside. Don't spend your time on Reddit. Explore the world of vibrations  
 If you feel sad you can play your favorite sunny, feel-good music and that will fix a lot.   I just played "Sunny" by Boney M after reading this. It felt like I was young again and felt like my parents were around me as I heard it. I felt happy as it continued to play. They told me different songs gave different emotions. How does this even work? This totally feels like I'm drunk but it feels better without being disoriented.  
Give Mr. Blue Sky a listen  
Oh yes Mr. Blue Sky ofcourse! Really good song! Currently listening to it ;)

Check out “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” by tears for fears !  
And then listen to "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by the funk band Lettuce (promise it does not disappoint). For some reason there are so many great covers to Tears for Fears songs.  
And then "Everybody wants to rule the world" by Ninja Sex Party  
Afterwards, "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Lorde  
Check out “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” by tears for fears !  
Came here to say this! And anything by The Cure  
Just Like Heaven, Friday I'm In Love, In Between Days...

Not directly music itself, but go ahead and watch the original Star Wars Trilogy/Lord of the Rings trilogy. In my humble opinion they have the best soundtracks of movie history, so watching them with sound will be an experience that will most definitely stick to you. edit: Also subscribe to r/perfectlycutscreams , you deserve those laughs  
If OP is in to games, he can't miss the Halo soundtracks. I still remember getting scared as shit when I was young, hearing the old Halo soundtracks.  
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHOHHHHHHHHHH OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOHOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OH HOOOOOOOHOHOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO HOHOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH

Michael Jackson's album Thriller is one of the biggest selling albums of all time, so if you like his voice try anything from that album.  
I just checked out "Thriller" on YouTube. I didn't watch the MTV and I just watched the lyric video. I felt like I could "see" things, like, the walls were vibrating. And although I knew it was supposed to be a scary song, I felt goosebumps all over me. It's like I could "see" better. It's like I was blind before and like now I can see everything, like I could see 360. My brother told me to check out Billie Jean and I totally froze as soon as I heard it. I didn't know people were full of emotions like this. I've been drunk before and hearing the songs feels even more emotional than being drunk.  
Rock with You is also very intoxicating.  
Wow. This sounds so different from other songs. My ears tickled. I feel giddy. Is this supposed to be like funny? I knew the lyrics but is the sound of it supposed to make one feel giddy?

Make sure to check out The Beatles as others suggested! I'm so happy for you! The music is one of the most beautiful things in the world, you can experience so many feelings and memories through music and sounds. Go create these memories friend!

Wow dude such a wonderful story!!! I am very happy for you. it must be such an exceptional experience! You should definitely check out The Beatles.  
I have checked out Yesterday as suggested by others as well. While I was listening to other songs, I felt overwhelmed but when I heard Yesterday, it's like I couldn't hear it. I could hear it but it's like I could sleep while it's playing while I wouldn't be able to sleep while the other songs I checked out played. This song makes me feel cool - not cold - but cool. Sometimes it made me feel warm. It's like cool and warm alternating. Am I crazy or is this how people feel when they hear songs?  
I just heard music for the first time in my life. Which songs should I listen to?
Honestly, this is not music, but just listen to nature sounds like animals or water falling. I love those 🤗  
I didn't know my dogs made sounds that tingled my ears (it doesn't really hurt. It just feels like someone is rubbing my head or ears) haha. Now I can locate where my dogs are. I feel like I have super powers. Haha. It feels so good, like I am able to see 360 degrees.

Okay, here's some music to investigate! Jeff Buckley Radiohead Kate Bush David Bowie Queen Amazing story! What an incredible voyage of discovery you're about to embark on with your newfound hearing! 😊  
I just listened to Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley! My breathing got slow but heavy and my eyes welled up with tears although this didn't happen with Billie Jean, and I felt like hugging somebody as I heard this. This is amazing! I can't believe I am feeling this. I have no idea what he's saying but I feel somewhat sad listening to this but it also feels comforting. It's like I'm being possessed by something - something that is kind and brother-like - not evil stuff.

Most people are mentioning modern music so here’s some CLASSICAL MUSIC Symphonies 5 and 8(Beethoven), Fur Elise, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Turkish March, Symphony 40(Mozart), Lacrimosa(Mozart), Vivaldi 4 Seasons, Tocatta and Fugue, Nutcracker, William Tell Overture, Barber of Seville, 1812 Overture... I’m sure this is enough to get started if you are interested in hearing older music. Edit: Thanks for the add ons, I haven’t listened to classical music in a while, so mine were just off the top of my head.

“Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin. Really, any song by Led Zeppelin.  
I don't know why. When I heard it, I couldn't help but think of the childhood memories and I feel sad and sleepy, like I have done lots of work for the day. Sometimes I felt taken aback and sometimes I found myself sad and smiling as well as I listened to it. It's really weird.

I don't get it. Redditors are so fast to jump to the conclusion that a post isn't genuine. Yet when something so...incredibly, obviously false - completely impossible, in fact - gets popular, everybody believes it?  Nobody is calling this out? Come on, reddit, you're letting me down. Yes, people can regain lost hearing...but they aren't going to have any ability to enjoy modern popular music, not right away.  It'd just be noise.  People who regain their hearing after spending a life in silence don't just start listening to as much music as they can.  They often turn their aids off because it gets too noisy for them.  They can't process music like you or I.  Also, OP wouldn't have the ability to distinguish a singer's voice from other sounds in the song - if you don't know what a guitar sounds like, how do you know it's not a voice?  It seems silly, but if you can't hear, you wouldn't know.  There's just so much...wrong...here.  But everybody wants to jump on board this fantasy train.  Well, enjoy the ride.  I'm not usually one to call out a post, but this one is egregiously bad and nobody else seems to be speaking up.

Hell, even deaf people from English speaking countries usually have a few quirks and mistakes in writing in English (sign languages have a completely different grammar system compared to English). But sure this guy had grew up and learned his countries sign language, learned how to write in his countries language and then learned to write in perfect English in a country with likely little resources for the deaf.

Every Breath You Take by Police Never Gonna Give you Up by Rick Astley Rap God by Eminem  September by ??( forgot)  
Out of all the Eminem songs I wouldn’t play rap god first lol. I would pick a more fun slower song like Without me.  Oh man, this guy probably hasn’t heard rap before, that just gives a whole new world of choices. September is Earth Wind and Fire btw, great song.

Just a very important reminder for everyone to stay safe!
Me being a designated driver is the reason I met my husband. And also reduced the risk of any innocent deaths. Seriously don't drink and drive  
As a huge drinker, I just want to commend you for being so selfless. Having someone that hung out with me and drove me around when I was drunk would be amazing. Now if I’m stuck somewhere where I’m drinking, I have to drink water and give myself a few hours or just end up staying there. I hate it.  
You don't have Uber/Lyft in your area? Or taxi service?  
Also I think you can call the police to pick you up I think

Now if I’m stuck somewhere where I’m drinking, I have to drink water and give myself a few hours or just end up staying there. I hate it.

Me being a designated driver is the reason I met my husband. And also reduced the risk of any innocent deaths. Seriously don't drink and drive  
Good advice, and that's cool that it led you to meeting your husband!  
Yeah I had seen him before and we had mutal friends but we'd never spoken much, we were at a house party and I was the DD for my friend group. He got very Ill, not from drinking too much but some winter vomiting bug, and needed a lift back home, my name was suggested and the rest is history!

Every year, my husband spends new year's eve driving Lyft for the primary purpose of making sure people can get where they need to go safely. I worry about him being on the roads. But at the same time, I'm glad he is

I suppose it's quite a profitable night as well. Making money and keeping people safe sounds like a win win.  
It is. Last year he made close to $300 for about 6 hours worth of driving.  
Those sympathy tips really add 😂. I remember working as a delivery driver in the snow in CO. I'm a great driver and didn't mind at all working in bad weather but people felt so bad for me they tipped like crazy haha

Tell him some dude on Reddit says thank you. That's an incredible service to do on a holiday like this, and he's definitely saving lives in doing it. To the rest of you going out and partying without a DD, tip your drivers well tonight!

I've always wanted to try doing this, but I live in a place without Uber/Lyft. Out of curiosity, is NYE the only time he does this?

Lost my little brother almost 4 years ago to drunk driving. He was the sober passenger and the only casualty. Helping my mother sort through his things as well organize his cremation and wakes was SO painful.  Please remember the other family when you get behind the wheel drunk tonight. It’s not worth it on SO many levels...just call a DD or Uber.  
I wish I could upvote this a million times. I'm so so sorry for you loss, and thank you for sharing your story to help other people  
Thank you :) The first year was the toughest and the holidays are especially tough because we are a close family but most days I just remember him and smile.  He was a mess and I miss him fiercely.

An intoxicated driver crashed into me at a red light a year ago tomorrow. Stay off the roads if you’re in no condition to drive; it’s not just your life.

That's dreadful, hope your all right.  
I came out, for the most part, ok, but the other person in the car got her spine all twisted somehow, and a pretty bad concussion. Could’ve been worse though, we were in a pretty good car. The people in front of us might not have been so lucky, as they had children in the back seat.

Great grandma passed away from a fall on Christmas Eve and the funeral was today, trust me don’t be going out doing stupid shit and ruin people’s lives while ending others.  Get a ride from someone sober, death shouldn’t be working on the holidays

Yep. My uncle's body was found last week, the day before Christmas Eve. He had died of a stroke in his apartment 4 or 5 days before. It wasn't pretty. I got to spend Christmas Eve cleaning out his putrid smelling apartment of important papers while avoiding the juices of his decomposition on the couch. Then Christmas was spent helping to plan his funeral. Not a good time. Don't cause it unnecessarily for someone else.

Lost one of my best friends, his girlfriend, and his brother all in one night because some asshole decided to get drunk drive fast. What pisses me off to this day (a little over five years ago this past Christmas) is that he ran off to a bar instead of getting help. Don't drink and drive. Please

I’m lucky that my mom wants to babysit her grandwoofer tonight so that SO and I can go enjoy our evening well into the New Year. Luckily she’s fine with fireworks, not that we will be having any in our area anyways.  
Do just everything you folks want to do to have fun!! Parenting dogs is like an invisible leash FOR the dog parents. They’re worth it, but doggie day care(full day) and in facility boarding for two dogs costs like $85/day. The cost of boarding is just slightly lower than a mid range hotel for humans.  From one dog mom to other dog parents, take pains to never get grandma mad at you guys!  Think about the doggie parents who are hiding under the bed comforting their noise phobic dogs and make a toast to all of the great people who happily stay home to help them deal with the fireworks. Our vet prescribes Ace Promazine for our lil dude.   It’s a calming med.   Bring your mom a lovely gift to thank her for dog sitting!

Fun fact: Driving tired is as equally dangerous as drunk driving.  
Can confirm.  I am only here today because some absolute saint made the decision to put rumble strips on the shoulders of interstate 45 in Texas. Never ever drive tired.  Pull over in a safe place and catch a quick nap.  Better late than dead.  
Fun fact: Driving tired is as equally dangerous as drunk driving.  
Driving while texting is even more dangerous than both  
Ok but what if we drive when we’re exhausted, drunk, and sending a text? Probably so bad that it goes into negative and starts making you better at driving, right? Right?  
Driving while texting is even more dangerous than both  
Fun fact: Driving tired is as equally dangerous as drunk driving.  
How about texting and fucking around with your cell phone while driving. Seriously, get the fuck off your phone and drive. I can minimize my exposure to drunk drivers, but distracted drivers are 24/7.

I found out my husband brags about me to his friends
This is what I hope to find one day. All the money in the world can’t buy it.  
As someone who feels they have this, you can’t find it, it finds you 🥰  
You've been lucky i'd say and that's great. Not everybody is lucky enough to find/be found in this life.  
That's true, but honestly, I'd argue neither does it find you nor do you find it. What happens is - if we do our own thing and we do it happily, stay open to people, are kind and don't shut ourselves off to the opportunity, chances arise - and these chances can often turn into something marvellous if people are willing to put the work in. It's less magic or fate or whatever crazy names people have for it than it is about honesty and communication anyway. Rough patches will always happen and compromises will absolutely be necessary - and as long as we're open to that and so is our partner, solutions can be found and love kept alive :)

Damn the more you avoid your feelings the more uncomfortable you become when they start to resurface. I lost friends this way. You want your feelings validated you gotta validate them yourself.

I’m oogling at your oogling. No kidding. Makes me happy :) may God bless you and your marriage forever . Love is beautiful, unique, special, personal, and all-absorbing. The bond between man and woman is as ancient and sacred as time itself. It’s the kind of love that makes you want to jump out of your own skin; the kind that makes you want to squeeze him/her until you explode. It’s the same kind of love that makes a little child smile thinking of their mom, and the same kind of love a puppy has for it’s master.The kind of love we envy and write about, that electrifying invigorating joy that shoots down your spine and through the body. 🙏  TLDR; congrats on winning at life

I really wish more couples understood this.  I see guys all the time talking about the ol' lady or the old ball and chain and talking about how marriage is a prison ersumshit.   Dude, what the hell are you talking about? I will never have a cross word to say about my wife to anyone.  The only words anyone will ever hear about her from me will be praise of the highest regard.  Granted, she is a truly amazing and wonderful woman, but she's still human and she has flaws.  But I'm not gonna sit and bitch to my buddies about them.  And be prepared to catch your teeth should a foul word about her cross your lips in my presence.  
Completely agree with you!  
That's easy when your wife is amazing. But when she isn't you sometimes need to vent to someone.  Internalizing and building anger isn't always the best thing.  
Perhaps addressing your issues with your wife to your wife might be a solution? Venting doesn't actually help, addressing the problem in a kind and understanding way does.

I couldn’t agree more. I work in a factory full of “wife bad” type old dudes. They constantly ask me if I hate being married yet and such. I never understand it. My wife is my favorite person to talk to! The part that always kills me is these guys will brag about how mean they are to their wives every day and then turn around and complain about how they never have sex anymore haha

I had a bunch of work friends over for a party like 4 years ago. When my wife mingles with them, they all talked about how positively I talk about her at work. She still brings that up from time to time, and is happy every time. If you want to win major points with your wife, have a third party tell her about how you talk her up when she's not around. She also was kicked out of a carpool because the other 3 women only wanted to bitch about their husbands, and she almost never had anything bad to say about me.

I agree 98% with this.  But my very best friend will hear all my uncensored thoughts, just because yeah, no person or relationship is perfect, and it's good for my mental health to have one person outside the relationship I can vent to/bounce ideas off of. Especially since my best friend is damn good at pointing out other perspectives to me and telling me when I'm just plain wrong or full of shit. A therapist would also be a valid outside-the-relationship person to be uncensored with.

I really wish more couples understood this.  I see guys all the time talking about the ol' lady or the old ball and chain and talking about how marriage is a prison ersumshit.   Dude, what the hell are you talking about? I will never have a cross word to say about my wife to anyone.  The only words anyone will ever hear about her from me will be praise of the highest regard.  Granted, she is a truly amazing and wonderful woman, but she's still human and she has flaws.  But I'm not gonna sit and bitch to my buddies about them.  And be prepared to catch your teeth should a foul word about her cross your lips in my presence.

This is very cool. Good on you. On you both, in fact. It makes me wonder how we got to the point today that a dismayingly large number of people (mostly men, but not entirely I guess) disparage behavior like your husband’s. Simping is the term I think. I see a lot of it here on Reddit and so that raises all kinds of questions, too.  There’s so much fear and ignorance and anger, even rage, where does it come from?  My god, I’m becoming a “Why can’t we all just get along” guy meme. Never mind, I’m happy for you both.  
I was talking to someone on Reddit, and they made a great point. They said most happy, successful people don't have a big online presence, they are actually living their life. The people online, the redditors, they are trying to fill a void, they have a lot of unhappiness in their life and are trying to find a way to fill it. He's right, and it's honestly sad

I used to brag about my ex-wife in the same way.  She also knew about it.  I didn’t know that she had opened like a thousand credit cards, maxed them all out, then cheated on me after I found out I have 3 completely incurable autoimmune diseases that will only get worse over time and make my life more and more painful until I die.  She and her kid she had before we were together didn’t have to pay for a single thing either.  I paid for everything.  She took all my money and somehow left me with all her debt.  I don’t get to see the kid anymore either.  I hope that little girl is ok.  I tried to open a new checking account a couple days ago and they denied me.  I’m happy to say that I was able to open a new “second chance” checking account today.  I don’t understand what I did wrong.  I thought we were in love.  I taught her kid her ABCs and how to read.  They never wanted for anything.  I was and still am romantic, or I do my very best I can.  I treated her kid as my own.  They always came first.  I’m a tall and attractive man as other people have told me.  I never cheated or even entertained the idea.  It wasn’t even on my radar as an option.  I have a very successful career and make good money.  I don’t know why I am even typing this.  I guess I am still just very hurt and confused.  Maybe my diagnosis was something she just didn’t want to deal with long term?  Maybe I am just an idiot and she was a shitty person the whole time?  It really didn’t seem that way.  I am really glad that your husband appreciates you so much that he can’t even contain his excitement for how great you are.  I bet that feels really good.  I hope I find that someday.

Have been feeding crows for weeks, they’ve started leaving me coins!! Surreal
They are not leaving you gifts, they're just paying for their food.  
Hahaha this made me laugh. I bet you’re right.

Reminds me of a story on reddit where this guy regularly gave a crow one of his tacos at lunch.  One day the crow brought him a coin and mimicked the word 'taco'.  It knew you needed money to buy tacos.

And they know and remember your face. They are everything wonderful.  
I had read that somewhere years ago, that crows remember your face. I didn’t know that they like to bring shiny things, more specifically money, to humans! The fact that they can recognize money and continue bringing pennies, blows my mind  
They’ll also communicate your face to other crows like their children. There are a lot of interesting stories about the shiny things crows give!  It’s ominous when a crow gives you a random key.

There was a story on r/nosleep a while ago where someone fed crows who gave them change and whatever. They moved and the crows followed them. Eventually the crows began bringing human teeth instead of money. Seemed made up, but was a really good read.

Corvids in general are incredibly intelligent. Some have even been trained to pick up litter on beaches in exchange for treats, and I remember reading a story about a girl that would drop crumbs on her way to school for the crows and they started bringing her ribbons and tinsel because she tended to wear clothes with ribbons.  On the flip side as well, they’ll remember who treats them badly. Plenty of stories about assholes that would throw rocks at them getting serial bird bombed constantly, even when they weren’t anywhere near the area where they abused the birds, and even watching to see what car they drove so they could get a nice thick layer all over it. Corvids are basically the bird form of “don’t start no shit.”  
I just burst dramatically into our living room and announced to my bewildered husband that “we need to find some crows, and we need to start feeding them.”

Ravens are very similar. Don't be an ass to them though, as they will be an ass right back. I provoked one a few years ago, and after a few days they must've found my balcony I would smoke on. There would often be one hangin out on it just making noise, Shit all over the place.  They bugged me for a couple months, then someone said to give them something. A handful of my dogs fur after a brushing, then more and more. Now I leave some outside once in a while, no more shitty balcony

Crows like shiny and metallic things. Growing up a buddy of mine had a pet crow and it used to bring him screws, nuts, bolts etc. One time his dad was rebuilding a lawnmower outside and the crow kept coming down and taking bolts and nuts out of the pile he had during disassembly.  
Okay that’s adorable, but I can imagine that that would have been super annoying, hahaha.  
My parents had a pet crow and it flew off with my dad’s watch.     edited for punctuation lol  
Chose his exit appropriately, wonder how much he pawned it for. Probably got him at least past Omaha.

Long time ago I saw a thing about a guy in New York who built a little peanut dispenser in his window that took quarters.  He trained a crow how to use it and that crow wound up teaching others, before long he had birds dropping off quarters for a couple peanuts each, gathering change from the whole city for him.  
I saw this it was a whole video and they described the entire process, it was the coolest

How did you attract crows specifically? I've always wanted to do this but it seems like finches and squirrels get the snacks first.  
I didn’t try to attract crows, we just like to feed birds in general and recently a lot of crows started coming by in the new area  
They’ll probably come back later this spring with their kids! This is a good time of year to feed them dog food, since usually parents are feeding their fledglings.  My crows never brought me rewards, but the same family has been coming back for three years. They also will go around the neighborhood with me when I go on walks.  
Do they do it sneakily in bursts from tree to tree or do they flutter behind you in full majesty as if you were a Disney princess?

I suggest to start giving special food to the ones that bring you more valuable coins, teach them some capitalism.  
maybe other little things like..... air pods

I actually kind of always wondered about this. Like, could you teach a crow (/whatever type of bird) to fly into an open window, recognize valuable items, and have them bring it to you? Or would the "fear" instinct be too strong to override? Or is entire thought just stupid?

Love this idea. Even hold paper money in your hand as you feed them.  
Or take the coin pile and place a dollar underneath. A crow might think another crow brought it and may try to imitate. Worst case scenario, the crows pick up paper litter off the streets.  
Worst case scenario a crow snatches money out of someone's hand. Concerned citizens are up in arms against the dangerous crows and the city institutes a systematic eradication.

That’s so sweet. Omg. My rabbits won’t even let me pet them, and I’ve been feeding them for years 😂😂😂  
Haha! Rabbits are so sweet and innocent though  
Ahah yes they are! They’re super docile, but they really don’t like being touched by people. Mine don’t, anyway 😂  
some do, some dont. Same way with almost all animals really including people

Eh, I've had rabbits that don't like being touched, like being touched sometimes, and rabbits that will run up to you like a dog and will let you pet anywhere. It just depends on their personality

This is SO DAMN CUTE. I find crows a bit spooky, which is probably ridiculous coming from an Australian. But hey. This is honestly so bloody adorable.  
You live in the country of painful deaths and you find cute birds spooky?  
Yeah, giant spiders and stuff are scary and all. But they're not spooky.

I saw a thread where the OP gave high quality fancy bread if the crows brought more expensive things such as bills. You should try that and make a whole side business criminal gang with the crows

Keep every penny/coin they give you and see how much you can make at the end of this lockdown.  
Write a blog about it, get a book deal, score a film deal, become a millionaire. Done.

I just started doing this after I saw the news story about the girl in Seattle (I believe).  I have an alarm set for noon and feed them nuts on my front lawn.  I am not getting gifts yet but they sure got my attention yesterday when I left the house at 2PM and had forgotten to feed them.  Thank you for posting about this because money is tight so buying the nuts is an extra expense but it's something I have wanted to do for a year or so... it is nice to read confirmation that it will "pay" off :)

Gotta teach them that bills are more valuable. They're smart, they know.  
Put out 10 5 dollar bills, every time they come to eat, let them watch you take one bill away and put it in your pocket, then promptly give them more food. This should.click for them and associate paper money for food. Then profit.

This is the kind of story that Disney would make a movie about  
Although the actual details are way different, awkward outcast lesbian gets with hot bully is one of the plot lines of Booksmart. There’s even an animated scene in the film... although it’s pretty far from Disney.  
LOL but what about that sweet sweet homophobic Chinese money Disney wants?  
The best they'd do is a Disney short, like that one on Disney+  
This is the kind of story that Disney would make a movie about  
If anyone here knows any movie producers, we need to pitch this idea for a rom-com. This could be big.  
Oh they see these convos. Someone has taken notes ;)

Homosexual relationships are too 'innapropriate' to make a movie about in Disney's opinion

 She still claims to this day that I’m the only girl she’s ever had feelings for   As a bisexual but homoromantic woman who lives a lesbian-only life, this makes me uneasy. I appreciate her being so honest but I hate the burden of being the exception. Good on you for being more comfortable in that than I would be.  
Genuinely not being a turd here, your first sentence just had a lot I’m not familiar with. What does it mean to be bisexual but homoromantic and living a lesbian-only life?  
not op, but i just want to pitch in my two cents to help you understand a bit. most people think that sexual attraction and romantic attraction come together as a package, but they can be two separate things, so for op, they're sexually attracted to men and women i.e. bisexual, but in terms of romantic attraction, they're only attracted to women i.e. homoromantic. not sure about the "lesbian-only life", so i'll leave that for op to explain.

Genuinely not being a turd here, your first sentence just had a lot I’m not familiar with. What does it mean to be bisexual but homoromantic and living a lesbian-only life?  
What she means is that she’s sexually attracted to both women and men but she only has romantic feelings for women. This is fairly common. A bisexual, homoromantic woman might sleep with men and feel attracted to them but wouldn’t generally develop romantic feelings for them and want to enter into a serious relationship with them. Similarly a bisexual heteroromantic woman might have sex with other women but only really falls for guys and wouldn’t want a relationship with a woman. Her saying she lives a lesbian only life probably means that she only gets involved sexually and romantically with women.

We know it’s certainly not the norm, at least in todays society, to start a family this young. However, we both know that we want a few children together and decided we’d rather have them young and enjoy our 50’s/60’s/so on together.

This is perhaps the greatest love story I’ve ever heard. As others have said, I really hope someone in Hollywood sees this because it needs to be turned into a script pronto.  On another note, I have a strange question. When you two got married, how did the last name situation work? It’s something I’ve always wondered about same sex marriages. I’ve noticed some couples combine their last names, others keep it the way it is, and I’ve even seen one couple create a totally new last name that they both took. How did you guys go about it and if you don’t mind me asking what is the reasoning behind it?  Congrats again and best of luck with the baby girl!

Well I meant like my head. I felt like there was dog sneeze floating around in my brain and deep inside my ear in places a qtip won’t reach.  It wasn’t a good feeling and I don’t think I’ll ever be the same but at least now I have Reddit Shame to mask my Unclean feeling.

Get an ear flushing kit from your local drug store. It'll clear out any ear wax at the same time

Well now I have bigger problems.... like Reddit thinking I let my dog do weird things to me.  Plot twist: I don’t.  
Auto text happens, dont worry.  Also I was serious about the gentle ear cleaning...

Your title made me think of an amusing (now) and mortifying (then) story from my early adolescence. I might as well share it here.     I was home alone one day and had just gotten done using the bathroom, wiped my rear, then knelt down to fill up a bath (our tub was broken and it took lots of fiddling to get it to stop up properly). My dad's dog zoomed into the bathroom and decided to, uh, clean my unintentionally yet perfectly presented rear. I swear, the moment she started my back end somehow overtook my front end in some sort of physics breaking gymnastic feat as I involuntarily threw myself into the bathtub. I shouted and flopped around like a fish out of water for a few moments before regaining my senses and calming down. I realized what had happened, washed up, and made sure to warn everyone not to let her lick them. I felt so violated. I was super careful around that dog after that although she did sneak attack me one other time. I was glad when my dad re-homed her.     edit: I should note that she was specifically my dad's dog and he was horrible at raising dogs. She went to a wonderful, loving home and lived, quite literally, happily ever after.  
This was wonderful until your dad rehomed her :(  
Honestly, it was for the better. My dad was terrible at raising dogs and she was kind of horrible as a result. He gave her to some neighbors who loved her, trained her, and took great care of her for the rest of her life.

That's sort of what's happening with the labrador and staffy I adopted this year at different times (coincidentally named Apollo and Athena, that I had nothing to do with!) The lab, Apollo, was spoiled rotten, severely overweight and had developed severe food aggression and has bitten people. So he's now with me and doing a lot better. Third of the size he used to be and much happier and confident.  The staffy, Athena, had zero training and zero boundaries. Has no idea how STRONG she is. She's doing so much better now she's with me!

I’m feeling the same. My wife were spending almost  $200 a week on cigarettes so the money is nice. It also helps that almost nobody smokes anymore.

Sorry about your brother 😕  
Thanks. I smoked for 45 years and probably tried to quit a thousand times. Now I’m addicted to nicotine lozenges. Lol  
My husband quit about six months ago, and has been using nicotine patches since then. If you find the lozenges are getting too pricey, we buy the 21mg patches and cut them into four pieces with no ill effects. At this point it's more of a low level stimulant/nootropic than an actual smoking cessation aid.  
I used patches in past attempts. They worked at first but the cravings always overwhelmed me. I’ve tried acupuncture,  SSRIs, Chantix, cold turkey. Never lasted long.

I work at a gas station and I’m always so proud of my regulars when they quit smoking. I’ve seen a lot of people try and fail. Good on you, OP. Keep it up!  
I had to make a reason to stop at my old corner market after a few months just to let him know I quit. It felt a little like losing a friend. 5+months tobacco free

Hey iv been off em for 3 months too. After 8-9 years of smoking a pack a day.  
Cold turkey? How’s it going?  
Yea man, like a turkey in a freezer from thanksgiving. Well honestly the main difference is that i feel like i have more energy and my body doesnt feel as weak. I dont sweat as much, no bad breath, clearer skin, my anxiety isnt as bad as it was. Overall just better. You?

That’s amazing! Congrats! If you’re a reader you should read Allen Carr’s easy way to stop smoking. Not because you need it, you obviously are already an ex-smoker, but the way he breaks down the psychology of smoking will blow your mind (and maybe even help you get past the lozenges). He smoked three packs a day and it eventually killed him but not before he quit and wrote that excellent book. You can probably borrow it from the library.

Awesome and congrats! Something I like to say instead of "I quit," is "I don't smoke." It's just like a small semantics thing but it feels so much better to say for me. Smoking is something I just don't do anymore. Saying "I quit" makes me feel like I stopped doing something I was supposed to be doing. Keep it up!

Great decision! I smoked for 41 years and quit after some pretty serious surgery. They had me in the hospital for 14 days, and after that just didn't pick them up again. I can definitely recommend a morphine drip to take the edge of quitting. It's been 3 years and I still get the occasional urge, especially if I am doing a little drinking, but haven't been seriously tempted to pick it back up. Sure like not spending $90 a week (carton and a half) as well. Again, way to go!

Congratulations! Great job. What was your journey towards quitting like?  
Fitful. I once quit for 1.5 years about 30 years ago. Always kicked myself for starting again. Quit several more times but never for very long. Rally, it was more about the money. Between my wife and me, we were spending about $9k a year. That blew my mind. Plus none of my friends smoked. My doctor was constantly on my ass about to a point I hated going to see her.

I quit too! We shut down here on a Tuesday. My last night of work before that was Saturday. Tuesday’s are my Monday. But I ended up feeling super sick Sunday-Wednesday. I called in on Tuesday cause I hadn’t gotten out of bed. Then I got the text that work was closing for the foreseeable future.  Because I was too sick to get out of bed I didn’t smoke for four days just naturally. I haven’t picked it back up and that was the 15th of last month. Feels so good. I can workout without losing my breath again!  Now to work on kicking alcohol and sugar.

That's not a terrible idea, because it shows a sense of humor. In small business we say that you hire for personalities and train for skills. finding someone with a sense of humor who can work well as part of a team is way more valuable than somebody who meets A B and C check marks, because the check marks are easy to train, but somebody that can jump into the team is hard to find. An easy-going manner and a sense of humor on the other hand, those are things that are priceless.  
But you should also be sure you don’t make everyone else feel inferior to the high honor of being the namesake of a pizza.  
"W—wait..." "Huh?" "Excuse me.. I need to check this out with my boss.." walks off "JERRY WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!" "Boss.. we found them" "WHO, JERRY?! WHO DID YOU FIND?"

This is a good response to the ice breaker: "what's one interesting fact about you?"  
I once had an interview where the interviewer said, “I always ask people to tell me something about them that they wouldn’t normally put on their resume.”  I talked about the time I single-handedly killed all of my party members in a Jurassic Park themed D&D game. But this is way better.  
Care to tell the story of the Jurassic Park murder?

It’s really pathetic honestly. We were in one of the Jeeps. I was driving. I epically failed my driving roll. Drove us all into an electric fence - and no one else passed their reaction checks. So we all died about 2 minutes in!

Dude the pizza sounds amazing, I've eaten dishes that have those exact ingredients and loved it but idk why it never occurred to me to put them on a pizza. You sir are a genius, I gotta try ordering that.  
Staaahhpp it. You’re making me blush.  What dishes were those? I’m interested...  
Well I guess you can call them "take a look what you have in your fridge and make some pasta with it" dish lol.  Oh but I once made myself a grilled cheese with ciabatta, spinach, a bit of garlic, mozarella, feta and sriracha (not really a tomato based product but it's red so I'm gonna count it anyway lol) and it was magnificent.  
Sold. That sounds amazing. Please make it for me sometime!

There was this local place called King David Dogs. The work crew would go every Friday. They had the classics "chili", "chicago", etc, but also had ones with and egg on top, one with just hot peppers, one with mac and cheese, and a whole bunch of others, even one with fries on top. One day some asked them if they could take the chili dog, put mac and cheese on it, bacon, and some ranch. They agreed and started working and smone other coworked says, "eeeewwww, that's a bad decision!" The next week we came in and on a hand written add on to the menu was the "bad decision dog". It stayed on the menu for years until they closed.

I am going to make an educated guess here; you are a vegetarian. If not, that still sounds like an excellent vegetarian pizza. And having a food named after you is great. Count Chocula was always  "Stoked" about it.  
I’m not actually! I just think that the average pizza meat is a bit too greasy so I just opt out when it comes to pizza.  
Good strategy!

I hope that was actually the name because that’s a cool as hell name.

Aw, memories of having a cocktail named after me when I lived abroad. Then everyone in the town started to call me by the name of the cocktail and the nickname stuck for years. It’s a great feeling! :)  
Wait. Waaaait. I’m confused. The cocktail was named after you but then you were named after the cocktail?  r/recursion

That is a pro level achievement earned.  Think about the percentage of people in the world who have a pizza named after them.  It's microscopic.  And now you're part of it! Congrats!

"see mom, told you someone would take after my name!"  
“Having a fart joke shop named after you shouldn’t be a life goal...”  But a pizza? Definitely.

I have a whole group of friends who’d walk around with a picture of my face chomping on a giant slice of pizza like a nerd. IT COULD WORK.

Wait. Is it really called “The Mirarom” or is it named after your real name? Or is Mirarom your real name?  
It’s after my real name, not Mirarom. That sounds too much like some sort of video game for an Italian place!

That is awesome and that pizza sounds so good. Definitely going to try it, with white sauce (garlic parmesan) because I can't do tomato sauce.

This reminds me of the reddit thread where the guy learned that you sit on the toilet seat and not the lip of the bowl...

If I remember correctly the seat was for ladies, while the bowl was for men. How it didn't confuse him there were seats in the men's room I have no idea  
He addressed that:  “I just thought it was a uni-sex/cost saving/oversight deal”

I legitimately was walking wrong for most of my life. I was seeing a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner, and I was telling him how my knees always hurt and I was having lower back pain and I was too young for this. He immediately said go walk, let me watch you. I took four steps and he said "you're walking wrong". I was keeping my back stiff and my legs too straight, I don't know why. I was walking like a zombie. He told me to focus on lowering my butt as I walked, like I was trying to sit down in a chair. My knee pain cleared up in like a month and hasn't come back in many years.

I swear I am not stupid. But when I was 18 I bought an electric tooth brush. I would apply paste to the bristles, turn it on and try to shove it in my mouth as fast as possible without slinging the paste everywhere.  One morning, my then girlfriend looked at me and asked “why don’t you turn it on after you put it in your mouth?” Top 5 the dumbest I’ve ever felt in my life.  
I spread it on my teeth before turning it on. edit: teeth/tooth

Waste the years or waste the water, that's the question   
Put a bucket to catch the cold water before you get in, use it to water your lawn/garden. No wasted water!

So you just step in shower and then turn water on?? Are you in a movie? I’m shivering just thinking about doing that... Soooo freaking funny!   
I started taking showers when I was 3 or 4, mom just had me figure it out! So I guess that's just how I always did it and never questioned it? It's not something anyone ever talks about, ans movies never show the wait time between turning on the shower and stepping in  I want to blame this on that lol  
This post honestly just made my day, this is so innocent and hilarious. I've had these types of things in my life before where someone questions the way I do something, shows me a waaaay easier way to do it and I'm blown away - of course I can't recall anything specific right now but I know how it feels.   
I am seriously questioning everything i do right now. Maybe i drive the wrong way but no one corrected me? Or maybe I'm putting on clothes the wrong way. Hell I might have been shaving wrong this whole time

At least you’re not the dude who didn’t wipe between his buttcheeks after pooping because he thought men didn’t do that! EDIT: Can't find the thread, but here is a screenshot of the post.  
My ex would only do one TP pass.   He thought I was just being weird and naggy when I pointed out that your underwear isn't supposed to be brown.

I dated a guy once who took baths because he hated washing his hair in the shower. He would use a cup as soon as he got in the tub and wash his hair. Wtf??  He said he He always got soap in his eyes? I asked a few more questions and found out he never once thought to turn around with his back to the shower and rinse his hair. This was not a stupid man by any measure.  He felt stupid when I explained showers to him though. You would have thought it would have clicked when he saw someone showering on TV at least.  Nope.  I changed that man’s entire life. Edit: WOW! Thanks for the Gold!   
I mean, I just close my eyes, rinse hair, rinse face, hand squeegee my eyes. Never had any issues.  You're telling me this dude just reverted back to being a child, taking baths and using a cup to rinse his hair? I can't believe people like this are just walking around. Haha

I don't understand the cup thing. Why not just dunk your head under the water? If you're big, just put your feet up the wall and scoot down onto your back and dunk your head.  
Toddlers and small children's biggest concerns in life are twofold. Making sure they get a turn with whatever toy is of current interest to someone else, and NOT getting shampoo in their eyes. However, they are super bad at following directions and keeping their eyes closed. It's pretty common for parents to have their wee ones lean their head back and then dump a cup of water over their hair to get the shampoo out while taking a bath. This gentleman appears to have gone back to that tried and true system after finding that devising a new system for showers, like closing one's eyes, was just too confounding.

This thread is blowing my mind. I suddenly realize, we mostly don't train people to take showers. We just throw them in there and let nature take its course. And it's a solo activity that we rarely see realistic depictions of in visual media out of a combination of tedium and squeamishness about nudity . . .   It's basically the perfect storm for cultural transmission of knowledge failure. Coooool.

Which explains why one of my coworkers doesn’t wash their ass and smells like shit. Wash your poop hole people! Yes, with soap. Yes get up there. EDIT: ok fine, some people don’t use soap apparently. I’ve used soap just fine and didn’t die and I don’t smell like ass. My point is some people come out of showers and still smell bad when they skip washing vital must-clean spots like armpits and pubic areas and ass, etc.

I did this until I was in high school and I commented on how the first few seconds of cold shower water are the worst part of any day. I spent the rest of the day in a daze about how dumb I had been for so many years   
2 seconds? It takes like a full minute for mine to warm up lol. The worst part of any day though really is getting out of the shower into the bathroom, wet and freezing with your hair dripping

I realized a couple months ago that rather than struggling to get the stupid plastic shield thing off the deodorant so I could use it, I could just click the deodorant up a little bit and easily pull it off. 30 years old and I never made the connection. I've used my husbands pliers to grab on to that thing before because I was so frustrated with it.  Edit: I'm glad I'm not the only one!

I thought my husband was the only other weirdo who did this lol! He undresses, hops in, closes the curtain THEN turns on the shower water... I just can’t abide the cold water, especially in the winter so I’m always like nah, I’ll wait a min.  Y’all wild lol

Haha the only time I've done this is if other people need to use the bathroom, I'll undress behind the curtain, chuck all my clothes out and then start it. And then shriek at the cold water until it turns warm hahaha. otherwise I'm running that until it's piping hot before I jump in   
If you have an adjustable shower head, you can point it straight downwards so it's not hitting you while you wait for it to warm up in that situation.

I do that. I also organize the silverware by type in each little cup while I'm loading the dishwasher so when I unload it I can just grab a handful and put them in the drawer without having to sort everything afterwards.   
But then all the spoons spoon with each other and stay dirty!

Since I first learned to shower as a little kid, I followed this sequence - Wash face, then body, then hair. For years I wrestled with having to re-rinse all the shampoo down. It did not occur to me until I was 34 years old - change the sequence! Hair, then face, then body. No repeat rinse, and the hair was already drip - dry by the time I was done. So much more efficient! I felt like a genius - a really dumb genius.

Well, a friend recently busted out laughing when she watched me take a pill. I drink water, hold it in my cheeks, then squeeze the pill through my lips like a reverse sphincter 😂 It never occurred to me to put the pill in first, then drink water. Edit: So after all the recommendations to tilt my head back, rather than force feed the pill through, I gave it a try with my vitamins...but it did not work. I ended up swallowing a bunch of air with my pill and water.  I like my sphincter method lol EDIT EDIT: I once again took everyone’s advice this morning. I went through my whole routine, but instead of struggling to swallow while looking up, only to be left with a pill still in my mouth, I looked down. Holy Shit! I couldn’t even tell I was swallowing a pill! Why did this take me decades to figure out? No one ever taught me to take pills obviously...thank you redditors!  
This is how my fiance has to take pills. She can't take the pill and follow with water or she can't get it down. I'm the exact opposite, I can take the pill dry, or take it and follow with water, but water then pill, nope can't do it without gagging. Brains are weird.  
I did try taking it the “correct way” , and nope, I couldn’t do it either!

My mom thought the toilet seat was just for women since "men have to put the lid up", so taught me to poop sitting on that skinny, nasty part. Didn't figure out I should/could actually use it till my mid 20s.

Twice. ​ I couldn't figure out how to brush my teeth without foaming out of my mouth and toothpaste dripping down my chin... the answer was to just spit it out in the middle of brushing. I noticed someone do it in a movie and caught on at about 23 years old. ​ Also, the sun visors in cars were always annoying to me because they stuck out right at your face when in use. At 33 my husband pointed out that they can be flipped all the way to point to towards the windshield instead. ​ I'm a pretty smart person with a family and a successful career.  
Yeah, Bring It On was pivotal for my development too. Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger  
I can't believe you got the movie right! Hahaha  
I remember that scene too! I still can't get over how they just spit out the toothpaste instead of rinsing it out with water. Is their way the right way? I have no idea! Edit - typo

I'm glad you finally got to enjoy a shower This is reminding of how much I hated baths as a kid because my mom would make me lean back and put my head and face under the tap when she washed my hair. I hated it so much because it hurt my back, I couldn't breathe, and I had to have my eyes squeezed shut the whole time. I didn't realize how unnecessary all that was until last week when my girlfriend was babysitting her nephew and I saw her use a bowl to just gently pour the water over his head. It blew my mind.

Think that's cool? Try wiping the water off yourself before going for the towel.  GAME CHANGED  
I realized this sometime around 6th grade. I could get dry quicker by using my the edge of my hands to slide the water off my body. Get dry quicker and my towel isn’t still wet by time I get home from school for my evening shower. I tried to figure out what else I could optimize in my morning routine then in my life. Probably had a big impact on how I approach problem solving in general.

Here’s one for you. Being  raised by a single mother most of the time in a house with grandmother, aunt, and two female cousins i always stepped out of the shower with the towel around my chest and went thru my whole life like that up until i moved in with my then girlfriend at 20ish. One day i walk out of the shower to her sitting on the bed giggling to herself as she asked me why don’t you just put the towel around your waist?....i had never thought to do that, i didn’t have an answer for her since I’ve always done it that way. We are still friends and she still teases me about it till this day. 8 years later

Oh man! I'm sorry.. but this made me laugh!! At least now you can go and enjoy all future showers  
For years I dreaded showers. It would take a few minutes to warm up and i was shivering and miserable the whole time. Now i think I'm going to look forward to them, the cold water was the worst part

I do... This was a few years ago, before my husband and I were matried, but we'd been living together for years. It is a standard that if one of us is out of work, they do more around the house. I was unemployed and therefore doing most of the chores and he kept leaving spoons with peanut butter globs still stuck to them. Basically he'd get a GIANT spoonful of peanut butter and then not finish it. He would leave the spoons in water, but as I'm sure some people here have noticed, that does pretty much nothing to break peanut butter down, not like a crusty spaghetti fork or something.  I got kind of mad at him, and asked him to stop doing that since it didn't actually help and kind of grossed me out and he got upset back. I don't really remember what he said (neither does he, as he spent the night mindblown, like OP) but it was something along the lines of, "So what I'm just supposed to let it get dry or force myself to eat it all?" I said "No, just wipe it off with a napkin!" The look on his face, I might as well have been explaining theoretical quantum thermodynamics, if that is even a thing.  So now we call those moments when someone suggests a really simple and usually obvious solution that we didn't even consider Peanut Butter and Spoon moments.

I always step into the shower and close the curtain before turning on the water because otherwise water goes everywhere the way that my shower is. I just run to the other side of the shower where the water won't hit me until it's warm.

I've known a few people to make that mistake. If it makes you feel any better I missed the bus one day because I couldn't find my keys. I tore everything up. We're talking covers flying off the bed, books off the shelf, swiping through a stack of mail, etc.  They were in my hand the whole time.

I bought a pumpkin for £20 and made it into a huge Cheshire Cat! He’s beautiful and I love him
Given that it‘s orange it could also double as demonic Garfield  
I absolutely never considered making it into a Garfield pumpkin. I feel so stupid now!!!  
Give it stripes and then post it on r/imsorryjon

Wow ! How long did it take? The result is amazing ! Can you put a light inside so that the smile would appear in the dark?  
It took me about 2 hours! I ended up putting a couple of pillar candles in to light it up. I think the smile seems darker because the mouth is on a bit of an angle. It really looks like that in person too so I’m really proud!! :D  
You really have talent, I'm impressed ! Yeah I'm sure it's even more impressive IRL  
Thank you so much!!! :D

How many candles does it take to make it really bright..? 3 maybe

What's Halloween like in the UK?  Is it as big a deal there as it is in the US? I mean, I can tell that OP is a fan!  I was just curious about the holiday over there in general.  
The trick or treating is quite a big thing although so is being a huge asshole when people knock on your door asking for sweets! Most people here celebrate it to some extent but so many people treat it as an occasion to be nasty to people for no reason, I have no idea why!  
I know what you mean, we get a lot of that here too.  I've never understood the vandalism aspect that seems to come with the holiday.  Why can't we have a nice night out having fun and being spooky without bringing vandalism into it?

One of my favorite childhood characters to this day. He looks like a chunky boy. I would have so enjoyed trick or treating at a house that had this outside. Amazing work!  
Thanks so much! I live in a village with only 40 houses and most of them are owned by retired couples so there are few children that get to see my monster pumpkin!

What an album grey Britain is. I was big into gallows back when I was a fresh faced teen... Also something about the pumpkin  
The pumpkins is meh. The t shirt wins. Although someone on the comments thinks Im lying about the picture being me because the t shirt is old....?????  
I mean grey Britain was 2009 so maybe it's true, a t shirt couldn't possibly last 10 years. Could it?  I have a reading Fest t from 06 somewhere. Band t shirts should out live you  
I have quite a few t shirts that are way older, I just don’t tumble dry them! Everything I wash gets put on the radiator 👍

This a what adults do - put their kids first,  Great job for all of you to recognize what is best for all the kids and have such a great relationship- your kids will absolutely benefit.  It’s unfortunate that more parents don’t do this after a divorce!  
It doesn’t even sound like they’re doing this to put the kids first. It sounds like they are legit friends who aren’t tearing themselves up over petty jealousy. Kudos to them.

It's absolutely about the kids. When they divorced they remained amicable because of the kids.  When thier child struggled with abuse at school, they came together for thier kid. The other guy found even more common ground to be friendly because he had a kid. He watches his kid and vice versa for the kids. Sure it's possible this could happen without kids, but these three people set aside personal issues and everything for the kids. They chose to constantly come together, after a divorce, for the kids first. And from this common ground and common goal they all became friends. The only thing I can really extrapolate from this is the ex-wife knows how to pick reasonable dudes.

Adults can't take care of the kids if none of the adults are in a good spot. I get the sentiment, but I think people don't think their own happiness, well being and calm state of mind are just as important if not more important than taking care of kids.  If you are thriving as an adult, it just means you are that much better at being able to take care of the kids.

Because they are still children at heart and mentally. They never learned how to be an adult.

Sounds like good people all around (except for the school), and a great example of what adults should act like. Thanks for sharing.

Aw that's really sweet. I'm glad you are all able to get along. You're a family, even if it's not in the typical way. Your kids are lucky to have all of you.

If what you're saying is true and you're being 100% honest, then you're basically a next-level human being. You're the fabled evolution beyond our basic primal behavior. You're the goddamn Ubermensch.  
This is 100% true. I don’t know of a way to prove it until  December.

I guess that if it is only recording, no wifi or data and nothing else running, it might work.

I understand you. My ex is still one of my best friends, but we've moved on from any romantic attraction. It honestly confuses me when people are so antagonistic with their ex. I understand we're the weird ones, but I can't seem to empathize with the "normal" divorced people.  
I think it depends on why the relationship came to an end. It's often easier for people to antagonize the other person while moving on as well.

I'm also on good terms with my former partners, though no kids or other complications like that.  When they're in town, I'm always down to grab dinner and catch up.  We might not be in love anymore, but I do still love them on some level for sure.  I can't excise them entirely from my lives.  It'd be unthinkable. I think it's just personality type.  People tend to cluster with people with similar personalities.  My current partner is the same way with his exes.  And now that I think on it, most of my friends are the same way too. By comparison, some of the more distant social circles I know seem to be completely full of people that are full of seething hatred for their former partners, even when there's no obvious reason for it like betrayal.

I think this is fantastic...  It's a great place to be when you can genuinely care enough about the other person to actively wish for their happiness, even when it's not with you. Sounds like you're all stand up people!  
 It's a great place to be when you can genuinely care enough about the other person to actively wish for their happiness, even when it's not with you.     I was a groomsman in my best friends wedding. My opposite bridesmaid? His ex.  It always brings back a little of my faith in humanity when I see folks that realize that incompatibility is not cause for hatred.

This is so absolutely touching. I hate that people would call your situation weird and that it is not the norm. Just because you got divorced doesn’t mean your ex needs to be your mortal enemy. Some people just don’t work as a couple and it takes time to learn that. I am so happy for you and I hope the school got what was coming to them because that is awful.  
Me and the wife split a few months ago but are still great friends and a lot of people just don’t understand it or think it is a joke. It is sad that people expect us to be fighting etc but at end of day it is up to us how we behave and interact and why throw away the friendship we had for so long. Plus less for them to gossip about!!!

I had no COVID symptoms at all, I wore a mask, and I washed my hands. Within 5 hours of waking up today I was in the ER
I hope you get better ! Sounds awful!  
Thank you! Honestly the hardest thing is that because no visitors are allowed my wife can’t be with me. I suck at being sick and she keeps me propped up when I’m in abject misery like this lol  
Oh that is even harder. I would hate to be separated from my partner as well! Has she been tested as well to make sure she is all clear? I really do wish you all the best and get well soon!  
She’s fine as of now but if I’m tested positive (which seems likely right now) she’ll have to self quarantine even if she isn’t sick. I appreciate the kindness, friend. Best to you and yours as well!

Trust me, you can be separated from your partner even without covid. I haven't seen my wife to be in 5 months because my country closed borders completely. I would love to be in your position.

You probably saved a lot more people than you realize from getting sick by staying vigilant. Get better soon!  
And by wearing a mask.  Thank you for doing that.   Too many people don't realize that it's not for them,i it's for those around them.  
People know it's not for them and that's the problem. Agree that this guy did the right thing to protect those around him. Wishing you fast healing and no lingering symptoms, OP!  
Exactly. I didn’t realize how much people literally have no empathy for others till this pandemic hit.  Even if masks aren’t effective or if they do infringe on your first amendment rights (spoiler: they don’t), so what? Is it that difficult to put on a mask for the sake of others? Are we really this individualistic? Go to parts of East Asia. People regularly wear masks looooong before the pandemic. Even for just the regular flu or for allergies. People realize that there are other people in the world than them.

Your reluctance to travel and mask-usage may have reduced the number of people you spread the illness to.  
This is kind of my take on it too. I'm doing everything I can to prevent catching this, but even if I get it I'm not this viruses tool.  Getting me sick is an evolutionary dead-end: I will not get anyone else sick. And it is really left me thinking about how accepting we are of sickness. Going to work sick, toughing it out, etc... diseases spread around the world through our apathy. it's going to be interesting seeing the studies of how other diseases were impacted by our increased awareness about Covid.  In areas that had populations that largely follows guidelines, was the flu season decreased greatly? Even beyond covid-19. How many lives could we be saving if we were all just a bit more aware and less accepting of the idea that we all inevitably just get sick.  Like it is some magical thing that just happens on a schedule as opposed to an infectious agent being spread from person to person.

I assume you are in America? I always feel sorry for you guys when it comes to health care. Can't understand the resistance to free health care, but I hear some of the arguments and a couple of them make some sense but seriously guys , we get choice of private health care which is cool cause it lets us go to private hospitals with Dr of our choice. Public is still great but food is shit and 4 ppl per room etc. I have had 2x back surgeries in public hospital by the best neuro surgeon in the area because all specialists are required to  oversee public hospital wards as well as private ones. It's a bit complicated but all up we get great health care which is free when you need it.

I just got out of the hospital and I don't wanna go back. Three people in my ward died in two days - it was really awful to hear.  
It would be terrifying to be in there and hear that people are dying around you from the same thing you have, getting the same treatment you are. Fuck. I'm glad you pulled through.

I tested positive yesterday, I've been doing the same and I'm compromised I have lung issues. So I'm terrified. I also have seen my boyfriend in weeks because of it and it's awful. Good luck I hope you feel better, stay strong x  
hey, i'm really sorry to hear about this. I don't know you, but i care. I'm not a doctor or medical specialist, but i know that when i've been sick with stuff lots of legit fruit juice and water makes me feel more human. we care.  
Thank you so much. Yes the sugars help! I really appreciate it. I have MCAS (it affects my whole body but very bad on my lungs in my case) so it's very scary but seeing your comment made me smile :) so thank you  
<3 hang in there as best you can and know that it's ok to be feeling whatever you're feeling- the fear, the ups and downs, anger, resentment, hope- I can't even begin to imagine- rest easy

I lived in the US for 20+ years before I left to immigrate to a country with a reasonable healthcare system and strong public infrastructure. Honestly, it's so much worse than even Reddit says. The average redditor is white middle class, so even though the system sucks for them, it's sooo much worse for lower class people or those who live in underprivileged areas (which unfortunately many people of color do). I have no regrets about leaving. It was like a living nightmare knowing my life could basically be over at any point due to getting seriously sick and being refused treatment, or worse, surviving and being in ridiculous amounts of debt. I'm so much more at ease being able to go to a hospital any time I need and know I'll never pay more than like $20, if even that. I make 40k a year and my tax burden for universal healthcare is only ~$60 a month. It's heaven compared to the US.

Sorry to hear your not well! How do you think you got it?  
I honestly have no idea. Could’ve been from work (we’ve had a few cases) despite me only going in once a week, or maybe from all the people I see cruising around Target and Food Lion without masks or improperly wearing them. The fact is that the compliance rate and enforcement is so low that the variables become impossible to track. Idk what would be a perfect solution, but the current state of affairs in the USA makes it hard to stay safe even if you do your job well.  
I was hoping to hear that you went somewhere crowded or something crazy! But nope, you were just doing the bare minimum interaction to get through life. That doesn’t sound great. I’m working from home and just go to the grocery store. It’s awful.  
It’s a pretty big counterpoint to deniers who seem to think the mask is a foolproof way to keep YOURSELF safe. Fact is, it stops everyone ELSE from getting to you. Can’t sneeze on you, can’t pick their nose and wipe it on a cereal box, whatever.

It’s a pretty big counterpoint to deniers who seem to think the mask is a foolproof way to keep YOURSELF safe. Fact is, it stops everyone ELSE from getting to you.

I honestly have no idea. Could’ve been from work (we’ve had a few cases) despite me only going in once a week, or maybe from all the people I see cruising around Target and Food Lion without masks or improperly wearing them. The fact is that the compliance rate and enforcement is so low that the variables become impossible to track. Idk what would be a perfect solution, but the current state of affairs in the USA makes it hard to stay safe even if you do your job well.

I had the same symptoms for about 5 days (minus cough) and my doctor couldnt figure it out. Then a rash broke out on my side and it turned out to be SHINGLES from the stress of self-isolating so hard and worrying about keeping everyone safe. If you develop and little bumps or rashes around your trunk or neck go to the doctor IMMEDIATELY to start your antiviral treatment.  
... I have a small itchy spot on my left side, even height with my belly button, and my neck itched just as I'm reading this. I think my body is just trying to freak me out.  
For me I thought it was little flea bites. We have a couch in the garage where the cats hang out and I took a nap out there. When I woke up I had probably 8 or 9 little raised, red bumps on my ribs on the side I had slept on. My dad looked it up, it was consistent with shingles, so we went to the doctor.  
Well damn. Ok, no bumps on me, just a little red, itchy spot. I hope. I've heard shingles are ridiculously painful.  I had chicken pox as a kid, so I have the virus in me.

Hang in there! My 65yr-old father wants to literally travel across the world to come see his new grandkid right now, and I've been having an impossible time explaining to him that that's a terrible idea for so many reasons. We live in a tiny apartment, and there's no way I could actually see him quarantine himself properly upon arrival--and not to mention flights in and out aren't exactly plentiful. It's like, look, I know it sucks, we were planning on moving there anyway, but there's nothing any of us can do for now, and doing nothing is actually the best way to ensure we'll all get to see each other... Then he starts going on about "I did things the right way, and I worked hard all my life to build my own little world" and all of this other unrelated stuff that has nothing to do with the state of the world. He's got high blood pressure and is asthmatic.  Family and friends, I love you, but we'll probably see each other next year or something. Sorry not sorry.  
We were planning to go see our new grandson right when this began. We didn't go (different illness), but my daughter's in-laws went, and her MIL caught COVID-19 on the way back.  Fortunately, they were wearing masks, and being very careful because of the new baby.  She didn't get symptomatic until afterwards; no one else got sick. She's recovering, but it knocked her out.   I'm stir crazy, but this is not the year to go visiting.

I feel like its inevitable. OP did everything right and still got sick.  
It depends on your situation. OP said they have to go into work and they’re also shopping in stores where masks aren’t required. The easiest way to get it is indoors where people aren’t wearing masks and they’re doing that weekly. If you’re an essential worker or have to go indoors in a place that doesn’t have mask requirements, you can buy cloth masks with a filter pocket. None of its fool proof but it’s an added layer of protection if you live in an area where people aren’t taking it seriously.

Good on you for staying strong to your convictions it obviously paid off.    So, related. I feel like when i'm not paying attention I just feel a little short of breath. So it's making me pay attention so I breathe a little more often to keep up. I'm 60% sure it's because I read an article yesterday saying asymptomatic people have been popping up with lung conditions and that terrifies me and it's making my brain spin... But did you experience a feeling like that? I'm just sitting at home working but it's making me so anxious.

Are you confirmed Corona diagnosed? Sounds like it could be something else.  
Yeah I am an essential worker and I wear my mask all the time, I’m as concerned as anyone.  This does sound like something else. This sounds like something that works a lot faster.  I’m not throwing shade on OP. I hope they recover fast as hell and have no side effects. Best of luck, I just think jumping to conclusions within 5 hours can cause more worry than would be necessary if they waited till it’s been confirmed.  
It could just be anxiety? I’ve diagnosed myself often with many things, 99.9% of the time it’s anxiety.

I don’t want to sound insensitive but we shouldn’t attribute any illness to “omg I got the COVID and you will too!” This is what makes reddit so unhealthy to read. Based on what op said about the warzone in the stomach methinks s/he contracted gastroenteritis (stomach flu) more likely than COVID.

I feel your pain. I hope you heal quickly and have no lasting affects. I was in the ER this morning with a scare. I went to bed last night, woke up coughing, chills, headache. I started freaking out and made myself hyperventilate @ 7 am which made me and my husband think, I have it. Was @ the ER by 7:17 We live close because I worked in EMS for 13 years until I was injured a couple years ago. I was tested and they ended up treating me for an acute migraine. I used to get them all the time, every other day. But when we moved closer to where I used to work, they stopped. I hadn't had one in 9 months. I am back at home but I am scared . We just got an Emergency Alert on our phones saying Franklin Co is having an alarming rate of positive tests and to wear the mask that has been mandated or stay home. Again, feel better, and I am so sorry that you have to go through this.

I live in a Korean neighbourhood, so masks have always been a thing and for the reasons you mention.  I thought pre-pandemic that it might be a good idea to get some for traveling, especially in winter.. keep the face nice and warm, prevent spreading colds, etc.  But then I grew out my beard.. mask-beard is worse than hat-hair! lol  They'll probably be normal now, but I'd love to see some for people with big heads/faces and beards. Mine definitely don't look good.  That being said, it's a pandemic, so mask-beard really isn't all that bad.  
I ordered these, and they cover my beard really well.  but, they don't come with the nose shaper wire thingy https://www.headlineshirts.net/xxl-beard-mask-2.html#.X4H17HZKiHs  
An easy diy way to do it is to thread a bread tie or other thin guage wire in the nose. I use craft wire which is round and a bit thicker so it stays in position better.  
OOOOHHH You mean the nose of the mask? I was like duuuuude

Oh that's a good idea! My dad has a big head lol and he always has trouble finding masks when they are all one size fits all types of deals  
My husband has a huge head. The under armour sized ones fit well but are ridiculously expensive. He likes the old navy ones for fit.

The ugliest half of my face is covered. I consider that a win  
Saaaaame. I haven't spent a single cent on makeup since March. Loving it.  
I think I’ve worn makeup about 10 times total since the mask mandate... 5 of them were for telehealth appointments.  I used to be an every day, high coverage wearer. I’ve gone through pretty much every stage at this point, I think. Still wearing it even though it’s a waste. Happy to not be wearing it, almost liberated. Sad and missing it. Bargaining and only using eye makeup and a concealer. I’m trying to reach the acceptance part but it’s hard when you’re 34 and have been doing something routinely for 20 years.  I have a couple coworkers that still do full face. One because she has a decade of insecurity from cystic acne (she went on accutane and is all clear but still carries it with her) and the other says she is trying to maintain a sense of normalcy and I’m so conflicted on that.  
I advocate for a new normal for makeup (and hair) and continue that when we we're not wearing masks and not working from home. Think of all the time (and don't forget money) spent doing your makeup and hair that you could spend sleeping, doing hobbies, spending time with loved ones, etc. It's ok to own your natural beauty contrary to what society tells women.

I have the resting bitch face, so apparently, covering my "annoyance" made me a little more approachable. But also the ugly part too

I like them to. But I was yesterday at the bank waring one and a hoody, nobady said anything, a year ago situation was very different.  
Lmao ikr, whenever I stand outside a convenience store and put on a mask before walking in, I always feel like I'm prepping to rob the place  
About four or  five months ago I had to stop to get gas, was inside the convenience store when I heard the door chime ring, looked up and saw three teens entering and pulling masks up over their face as they entered. I chuckled to myself because the relief came as they actually put the mask ON. I felt like we were officially living in “opposite world”.

Never did I think that I would put on a mask, go in a bank, and tell them I want money. But here we are.  
I did this just the other day AND forgot to remove my sunglasses as well. They were surprisingly fine with it.

Yes, I was wearing a black hoodie with my black mask the other day and caught a glimpse of myself walking past a window, suddenly realised I looked like a bank robber or a mugger.  
That remember me of the time I decided to shave my beard just to almost give myself a heart attack next morning when I don't recognize myself in the mirror. I did it to better fit a mask.

People should wear masks whenever they have any illness, COVID or not, it’s actually pretty common where I’m from  
This. I’m from Asia and people wear masks whenever. Even when the weather is cold. It was shocking for me to see that people would protest over masks.  
Me, too. I lived in Japan for a while. I started wearing a mask in March. It creeped people out where I lived.  Needless to say, it commonplace now.  
I live in Japan now. 99% of people wear masks. It's insane to me that anyone would have a problem with it. Japanese people struggle to understand why anyone would have a problem wearing a mask. I struggle to explain it.

I also love wearing them. I have anxiety and I often pull my hoodie up over my chin/mouth or in winter cover my face with a scarf. I don’t like it when people stare on public transport and even if they aren’t, my anxiety makes me think they are. I can wear a mask and put my hoodie over my head and hide away under them. It’s perfect!

I feel you on the public transport. Pre-covid, not a week went by without some guy making a comment on my commute. Wearing a plain mask makes me so much more invisible and I've really enjoyed not having to manage random mens' feelings for my own safety. I will absolutely continue to mask up on public transportation for the rest of my life.

Coffee breath? Mask. So I'm only suffocating myself.  
I have a sore throat so I take mint candies to soothe it. If you wear a mask while eating mint flavored stuff, you're gonna cry ;D  
Coffee breath? Mask. So I'm only suffocating myself.  
I always brush my teeth before masking just in case.  
If I did that, I would be brushing my teeth 30 times a day. I drink a lot of coffee  
Coffee breath? Mask. So I'm only suffocating myself.  
It was only after I started wearing masks that I realized how much flossing makes a difference in my breath. Flossing is def part of my routine now  
Please floss if you don't want to replace teeth or get root canals. I thought I had something stuck in my teeth for a week, but I found out yesterday that I broke every tooth I have at the gum line and edge of every single tooth, so they'll all need to be removed (can't afford even one root canal and it's not worth it since they'll die down the road). I'm turning 23 in December and will likely not have any teeth by 24. Thankfully I accepted that I'd be young with dentures back when I was 19, but others might not be happy to hear they don't need to brush ever again. Flossing hurts less than extractions.

If you want to keep wearing a mask afterwards, you can do that! Personally, I dislike masks because they fog up my glasses and make it difficult for me to see. But you do you!  
I got anti-fog drops off Amazon for my glasses. They work pretty well, but need to be reapplied regularly.  
Baby shampoo does the same for cheaper. Scuba divers use it all the time.

Here’s a trick I learned. Move your glasses just a little bit forward, and your glasses don’t fog up as much. When you keep them all the way back, they tend to fog up a lot, but not if you move them a little bit forward.  
Good call. My glasses fogging up drove me nuts before I started doing this.

Okay, here's my glasses mask trick that isn't a trick but an actual mask hack.  I have this flexible aluminum wire that's used in sculpture called armature wire, it's super useful to have around because it's soft and flexible by hand but holds it's form.  Whatever masks I have, I'll cut a slit and feed some of that wire into the nose bridge, and then stitch it into place.  But I don't just do the nose bridge, I have the wire run from the cheek near the outer edge of my eye all the way to the other cheek, so the wire then moulds to my nose bridge and cheeks, sealing up that gap where your breath comes out and hits your glasses.  I'll post pics if anyone's interested.

I had the same problem, but learned that washing the lenses with soapy water and letting them airdry prevents fogginess. It's a pain to remember everytime I go out, but it only takes a few minutes.

I wonder though about laws. Some states or counties in the US have laws against wearing masks unless you are doing a job that requires them. I suppose public or personal health may override, but I'm not sure.  
New York was one of those places. The law was from 1879 (IIRC) and it was exclusively used as a tool of oppression. Luckily, in a rare moment of sanity, the Legislature repealed the law in March.  
I think a lot of those anti mask laws were to stop racists like klansmen etc.  
I wonder though about laws. Some states or counties in the US have laws against wearing masks unless you are doing a job that requires them. I suppose public or personal health may override, but I'm not sure.  
If you want to keep wearing a mask afterwards, you can do that! Personally, I dislike masks because they fog up my glasses and make it difficult for me to see. But you do you!

I had the flu in January and wore a mask to the pharmacy. Everyone looked at me weird but if only I could see them now and look at them weird with their masks!! Crazy because I remember googling coronavirus in my state at the time, but it didn’t really become nationwide until March or so. I’d never had the flu before and it was horrible. Only lasted a day and a half though.  
It’s possible you actually did have covid. Check out This Recent Article from the Wall Street Journal that shows that Covid hit us much earlier than we thought.  
I don’t think it was. I was told it was Flu B whereas covid is not. I can’t check out the article as I don’t have an account. Does it say anything like that?

I figure, after pandemic ends (whenever that is), I’ll stick to wearing them whenever I have a cold or don’t feel well.

Yes, if the socially responsible decide to continue to wear masks we could make it mainstream. There will always be people that refuse but they're the same ones that do now. I've already decided that when it's safe and I have the capital to start my own business, optional mask usage will be written in to the uniform policy. The biggest issue I know a lot of retail businesses faced at the start of the pandemic was "do we allow masks or don't we? It's never been brought up before."  
this mask experience - and specifically the people who keep their FUCKING noses out - has made me hate people in a way I didn't think I had in me.

O don't dig the masks. I wear them because well duh. I can see them being great for severe allergies or " is this a cold?" So yea I like to think they will stick around for stuff bit i personally will be glad when they dont need to be a daily thing.

I think that would be a terrible idea. I’m hearing impaired and I need to lip read to understand what someone is saying. Masks cover that up completely.  
Yeah that would suck. But I think if you're sick it would still be for the best. Plus if you're not you can pull it down !

Is it ok that I don't like them? I mean, it's not a big deal to me to wear one, I really feel for people working in retail who have to deal with those that actively sabotage the idea of stopping spread by not wearing them, or having their nose stick out. I actually feel more self conscious with a mask. I have a harder time recognizing people (already difficult for me) I can't smile at anyone, and the good ones are another expensive accessory and I have a hard enough time affording all the other necessary things for life. I have a few cheapo ones and I am glad to take them off whenever I get out of a public space. It definitely seems like a good idea to wear when sick, or on cold days (as long as the dampness doesn't interfere - that clammy air seems like a good spot for random bacteria). I'm glad they help with anxiety for some. But I am looking forward to not wearing them as much anyway, and not worrying when I forget mine.  
Nothing wrong with not liking wearing it.  I strongly dislike wearing mine, but I do when/where required out of respect for those around me.  But, as soon as possible, I take the damned thing off.  It's probably just all in my head, but I get short of breath with mine on, and it makes my beard kind of itchy.

I wear mine out all the time too and I I've really come to hate it. I've never said "what?" so many times in my life before. I'm tired of always being muffled and everyone trying to say something in public being muffled to where we can't even hear each other (and no, I'm saying the alternative of spreading covid is better). The staff at the gym and myself don't even say hi anymore. Everyone feels much more isolated  since we're missing such a significant set of social cues.

Yesss! And I don’t want anyone sick coughing on me. We all learned how to cover our mouths when we were 5, but some people still want to be inconsiderate trash pandas. I wish everyone would wear a mask when they are sick.

I love the masks. This is the first year my seasonal allergies hasn’t flared up and I’ve used less makeup since I’m covered anyways. I also feel less “icky”when I’m out and hear people coughing or sneezing.  
I hear ya. I’ve never gone this long without a cold.

I have a chronic cough that's not related to any contagious situation.  I had bought a small pack of masks in January because I was thinking of just wearing them on my commute, so I didn't have to worry about covering my mouth when I cough (since one hand was holding my phone and the other the subway strap), or about coughs escaping around an elbow, etc.    (I used to cough into my jacket neck, but I had someone yell at me for not covering my cough. ?!? And warm weather would come and I might not have a jacket neck to use)   But I hesitated to wear them because I didn't know how people would react--that they'd think I was contagious and tell me I should stay home anyway.  Now I'm just going to wear a mask everywhere I go.  
you must get some crazy side-eye when you are out and happen to cough.

My wife of 24 years just farted in front of me for the first time ever.
My husband of 12 years just realized, thanks to all the extra time we're spending together, that I laugh every time he farts. Every damn time. I didn't even realize it myself. Now he's started laughing when I laugh, which makes me crack up even more.  I was worried about how we'd handle all the togetherness, so it's a relief that we get so much enjoyment just farting around!

He's lucky. My wife doesnt think its funny anymore. Especially when I rattle the windows, and without cracking a smile, tell her, "  Sorry, it slipped".  
Opposite for me and my husband. I’m the one rattling the windows and he’s the one looking at me in defeat going “Really?” (Except I haven’t mastered the not cracking a smile thing. I still just about die laughing every time. He’s a trooper.)

That’s awesome!!! I farted in front of my boyfriend the second time we hung out. We were on a bridge looking into the water and I just let one rip. Then he did. We now still call it “fart bridge”, and fart on/around each other daily. Its the best

Manages to not fart for 24 years...husband posts it online for the one time you did.  
Yes. This is my nightmare as a polite non-farter.  
I've been with my wife for nearly 15 years and she has never farted around me. Apparently she farted once in the kitchen around the kids and they bring it up all the time.

Girlfriend never farts, claims she doesn't fart, is disgusted at the notion that she is even capable of farting. I told her she rips mad ass in her sleep and she called me a psycho.  I downloaded one of those sleep recording apps and set it on while i went to work late one night, went to sleep around 3am and stopped the app.  Showed her the 13 loud boisterous farts in the morning and of course she thinks I came and ripped ass on my own phone.  
i lost it at “rips mad ass” and now i can’t stop laughing

When my wife and I were dating, I helped embarrass the hell out of her on accident.  I was dreaming about bugs around me, and she was very close to me (full size bed at the time).  She farted in her sleep while her butt was touching my leg.  Of course mixed with my bug dream, I thought a bug had got me and I woke up and freaked out like one had.  My heart was racing and she was mortified.  We laugh about it now.  And she also only farts in her sleep.  I tend to not purposely fart audibly in front of her as well.  Not sure why.  Maybe to keep some mystique, I don’t know.

When I was in college in the 90s I was dating a girl for a few weeks before we had our first all night shag session. The next morning she was sitting on my chest and let a whopper rip, it was LOUD.  She's taking a bath now and should come to bed in a few.

One time I forgot to flush after pooping at my at-the-time GF’s place. She mentioned it in passing and I almost threw up from embarrassment.

My wife of 24 years just farted in front of me for the first time ever.
The first time I farted in front of my now-husband was when we were getting frisky. We were in the middle of...stuff...and he kind of squeezed one out of me. I was so embarrassed. My husband, bless him, looked at me and was like “that’s it? That’s nothing. That wouldn’t even singe the hair on a dog.” And we went back to our business. We still laugh about it and we’ve been together for 15 years.  
That is hilarious!

My husband farted the first day we met. He was at my uncle's house and he needed to use the bathroom really bad. My uncle was taking for ever and he accidentally farted and said sorry. In his culture, it's really rude and disrespectful to fart in front of someone, even your own siblings or parents, so it was a funny moment where he let go of all those ideas and had to fart. Edit: he didn't fart in me. Not sure what happened there.

Those are rough. I work at a hospital and one of the patients called us because his bag was standing erect, absolutely filled with gas to the point that it was taught and we didnt want to lose the bag or put our guy in any unnecessary discomfort. After we drew straws one giy went in to go "burp" it and let the gas out and it was so foul that he had to go sit in the breakroom because the smell just clung to his clothes

And then there's my house where my husband of 27 years and my 2 adult sons will hold in a fart until they can get near one another so they can fart in/near someone's face. I would love some more manners.  
I so feel you. We have four kids, and every person in this house but me thinks it’s totally hilarious to hold them in until their butt is a foot from my face. Ugh.  
Mine don't dare do it to me. They fear the wrath of mom.  
How do I get scarier? Teach me your ways!

You are not alone buddy. Also my wife is vegan and does not tolerate beans that much. This is a murder scene  
Has she tried the vegan version of Beano called Bean-zyme? If not it might help you both be a bit more comfortable!

I had a first date at the movies last year and luckily we got there before anyone else was inside, and as soon as I sat down in the theater she stood back up while saying “excuse me I need to fart” and before I could comprehend the statement she’s stepping over the seats in front of us and trots to the other side of the theater, does a power squat between the row while gripping two seats.  She looked like she was about to launch into orbit and once she finished she sat back down next to me and I was completely bewildered as to how to feel.  
Launch into orbit? Sounds like she was going to take a power shit. Didn’t anyone ever tell her don’t trust a fart? That could have ended badly.  
God I almost wish she did. It would have been an even more interesting story to tell.  
It’s one of the weirdest things I’ve read......like was she a weird person in general?  
God I almost wish she did. It would have been an even more interesting story to tell.  
Yeah I really need to know if she did this for comedic effect or if she thought that was totally normal? Cause those are two totally different types of people.  
I had a first date at the movies last year and luckily we got there before anyone else was inside, and as soon as I sat down in the theater she stood back up while saying “excuse me I need to fart” and before I could comprehend the statement she’s stepping over the seats in front of us and trots to the other side of the theater, does a power squat between the row while gripping two seats.  She looked like she was about to launch into orbit and once she finished she sat back down next to me and I was completely bewildered as to how to feel.

Moments like that are brilliant 😂  
Oh, I agree! Made my whole day hahah  
I’m happy that you shared a moment like this with us lol  
Same. I have room in my heart especially reserved for anecdotal farts edit: specially/especially

I laughed all the way through these comments! Farting makes me laugh no matter what. I can't not laugh when one gets ripped. It's like music to my ears.  
I tell people that my fart humor never matured past teenage years. I’m a 27 yr old woman and I laugh so hard! My absolute favorite is the sneeze/fart combo!

Comdey gold! I like to sometimes spice it up before a fart for example ask "Did you hear that?" Wait for a response then interrupt with toot.  
My husband will ask "Do you smell smoke?" And the first time, I sniffed hard. Never again.

My SO was huge on manners too, but the day I told him it was okay and natural to fart or burp, it never stopped. Help  
I feel like there's a difference between "it's natural" and reveling in it

She didn’t fart.  She tooted.  
Sounds fancier, I like it  
As my grandma would say, she “fluffed”  
My grandma says that too. Is your grandma my grandma?

I had to fart in front of my boyfriend like the third month dating him... I had altitude sickness on a trip we went on and my stomach was WRECKED. I couldn't hold it in anymore, I was like I'm so sorry this has to happen now hahahah we've been farting in front of each other ever since!

Wait a minute. You two were dating for three months and you farted first? Maybe it because I'm a guy, but I doubt I could be around a group of tight-ass nuns for three days before I ripped one off.

My mom was outside one morning with my stepdad. She was sitting on that plastic type deck. She farted thinking it would be silent, but instead it amplified it like a megaphone.

My boyfriends mom is the exact same way and they are celebrating their 30th anniversary this year! We had a huge discussion about it and I was astonished at the possibility of this! She said she has never tooted in from of him! It’s hard to fathom. They must just not toot a lot because if it were me I’d have a stomach ache MOST days.  
Almost to 32 years of marriage and my wife still hasn’t farted in front of me. All I ever get are the the night windies.  
"night windies" omg

The "sorry" reminds me of my college roommate, us sitting on opposite sides of a small room. Him: [Suddenly smiling] Me: "What?" Him: "Sorry." Me: "Sorry ab--" [phalanx of farts reaches me] "You asshole." Him: "I said I was sorry."

I never understood married people who don't fart in front of each other or can't be in the bathroom at the same time while one is on the toilet. ​ Like, if you can have sex with someone, everything else should be no big deal. ​ EDIT: I am flabbergasted by all of these responses. I just can't understand how you can be married to someone, this is your partner, your best friend, your spouse, that you have BEEN INSIDE OF, but the idea of seeing them on the toilet is 'gross', is just beyond me. Especially people with kids! I just can't understand it one bit.  
We all have our limits. I like my privacy in the bathroom too, but my wife is private about everything that relates to bodily functions. She gets grossed out easily and she had a very strict ''act like a lady'' upbringing, so it's understandable.

Aaaahhh! Congratulations dude!! So happy to hear you're alive and cuddling with your cat!! Several years ago I was really suicidal too. I never went through with it cause I knew my cat would be sad and I couldn't bear to upset him. He's sleeping af my feet right now and I've been on antidepressants for like 5 years. Sending you and your kitty positive vibes and well wishes! Hope your recovery continues to go smoothly! What kind of cake are you baking?  
My cat really helped me pull through. They are incredible creatures. Chocolate Guinness. The one and only.

Glad you're still here. Not half as glad as your cat is - and my cat would totally agree. Cats rock. Respect on the baking thing. Good skill.  
Adopting my kitty was the best decision of my adult life. I’m eating my cake as I go through the comments. Makes it twice as sweet.  
i hope the fact that you decided not to end your life will be the 2nd best decision in your adult life (because really what can top a cat, nothing)! coming from an attempt survivor i am extremely happy i did not succeed even though i still struggle a lot. also have 3 cats :) one is orange like yours💕

stay strong OP! It might not seem like it all the time but you matter and your life has purpose. It's a crazy unforgiving world we live in but there is beauty, peace, and tranquility to be discovered inside and out. hang in there ❤  
I’m going to keep trying, even if it’s just for my cat. He’s worth it.

So true! I’m going to bake some muffins tomorrow.  
I’m not a baker but I am going to whip up some chocolate banana pancakes today for the first time in years! Don’t normally have a sweet tooth but I’ve had a craving for them for a few days. Hope your day goes amazing :-)  
Yours too!! Now I have a craving to go buy bananas haha

Fuck man, that is not casual, but thanks for reaching out. My brother attempted last year. Luckily he called a hotline before & they found him in time. He's staying @ mom & dads now depressed, not looking for work, ect. ect. I live a tough life, & I think lots of us do. What is your advise; how or what can we do to help a friend/family member/ or just a fellow redditor/human that feels like this is the answer?

Super glad to hear that! I'm proud of you too! Have a hug 🤗!  
Thank you ♥️  
You should write a thank you letter from the present you to your past you. Embellish it with some stickers, colours or nice typography. And put it in a frame. Display it in your home. Make a nice reminder of yourself helping yourself.  
I write in a journal everyday; I wrote about this week a lot. Reading my past journals helped bring me out of my dark place :)

I'm so happy you're still in the world, I hope things keep on getting better for you. Enjoy your cake and your kitty cuddles and feel that pride - you've earned it! Could you reach out to a friend or family member and show them the letter(s) you were going to leave, ask for their help in destroying them, if it's too hard to do alone? Perhaps it could open a further line of communication in your life to let the people around you know what you've been struggling with, if they don't already know? Even if you don't want to discuss it with people irl, I hope you stay active on reddit and things continue to get better for you. On a separate note - what kind of cake did you make?

I don't know you personally but I'm really proud of you. It also means a lot to me as someone who has depression. I think we've lost enough people to suicide. On a side note: i loooove cake

i am proud of you too!! there is always a way to start all over again even when it IS so dark, that's a super power .. to be able to create the light out of complete darkness we just have to keep trying and never stop fighting and when there is no more energy to keep trying we ask for help, this makes us human  and being human is absolutely magical. you are magical in every way :)

You reminded me of my former self a few years ago. Things are not perfect here but I learned something: the joy is in the little things, not in the big ones. A cake? your cat?, that's the way. The sun, the sky at night, your favourite coffee and your favourite songs. All of those things work even in the case you are alone. You are strong, and you just proved it to yourself, you have what it takes.

Proud of you for having the courage to make that call.  
I am too, I was pissed at first, but the day after I realized it was a pretty brave thing to do.

As someone who lost two people very close to me to suicide last year, this post makes me so happy. It leaves so much misery and devastation in it’s wake. But I’ve suffered from depression and I get that it’s all too easy to fall so far it not only seems impossible to pull yourself back up, but you actually believe that your loved ones will better off without you . But you know what? They won’t. Not at all. And neither would your cat! Thank you for being brave enough not only to carry on but to post this- you never know, it might just save someone’s life. Wishing you peace and love❤️  
Love for my family and my cat helped bring me back. Baby steps, but it’s amazing to say that I’m glad to be alive right now. Thank you for the love ♥️  
Baby steps are all I takes. My dog got me through the worst of it- nothing like the unconditional love of an animal. Stay strong op- you got this ❤️

Saying that I'm happy you are alive to a stranger seems strange to me so let's just say that I'm glad this story had a good ending.

Cake day!!  
Hahaha a few days left until my actual cake day, but everyday is cake day!!  
Cake day!!  
Literally.  
I shit you not, this word cracks me up like nothing else XD Literally.!  
My son used to overuse the shit out of it and it used to get my back right up lol. Litreally, everything, was literally. He'd be like "So, I literally walked to the shop and the cash machine was literally broken".   FUCKING STOP IT. I did not bring you up with such limited vocabulary.

Baby steps. One task at a time. Glad you decided against it. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary situation.  Give yourself a pat on the back and enjoy that cake!!! ​ PS - What kind of cake have you cooked?  
I keep telling myself to take things slow and listen to myself. The cake helps a lot. I baked chocolate Guinness, the best!  
Oh my, I love chocolate cake but never heard of that. Do you have a recepie or is this one of your own concoctions?

You should know that just by sharing this story on Reddit, you have touched many hearts and had an impact on our lives. Even things you may consider to be small can and will mean a lot to others.  You matter way more than you realise and have had an impact on all of us commenters. Start small with your mental recovery. Even if all you did today is get out of bed and make a cake, that's still a victory, no matter how small it may seem. Keep fighting, keep living. After all, you deserve it! ;  
The responses are overwhelming and I have not seen one negative comment. It's really quite something.

My cats have saved my life many times as well. It feels like they take care of me more than I take care of them. Or maybe the fact that all they require is food and water in exchange for endless love & cuddles feels like I have it made. Your 21st sounds like my kinda time. Baking cakes and petting kitties...anyone would be lucky to be your friend! I’m so glad you’re still here with us. It takes a lot of strength to face the day when you’re suffering, I hope you are proud of that, because some days that is all we can do. I hope you feel better soon OP. You deserve to be happy. <3

Glas you're still here! My best friend took his life on Tuesday and I wish he had done as you.  
I’m sorry for your loss. This was the first time the suicide hotline had actually made a difference in my life. I hope it does so for other people as well.

Congratulations! I’m really happy for you <3 and your kitty loves you so much!! I love it!! Edit to say that your kitty loves and needs you. There are so many times where I know I can’t slip mentally because my 9yr old cat loves and needs me. They’re just such special creatures. Even if you’re waking up everyday just for cat, that’s a pretty great reason to wake up :)  
I don’t deserve his love, but I’m glad for it :)

No matter how much “help” I get I still want to kill myself. I’ve been dying in the inside for 16 years. I’ve tried multiple times doing it. It doesn’t get better for me.  I’m glad you’re better. I hope you stay that way. Good luck with life.

oh fuck this hit deep. i'm so proud of you! i know this will get lost, but you can message me anytime you want. now, your cat (sorry i love cats). tell me about them but tell me about you too. i'm not good with advice but please go to a doctor, just for a random checkup or for a full blown 'depression discussion', as my doc used to say to me. i'm with you dude  
My suicide D-Day was the 19th. It’s the 21st, and I’m alive, cuddling with my cat, and baking a cake just for myself. Pretty proud.

I am so proud of you. With tears in my eyes. I hope everyday you wake up and cuddle your kitty and start loving life again. Congratulations 🖤🖤🖤🖤  
Baby steps, but I’m going to keep trying! Thank you ♥️

I am sorry. I wish I could hug you right now. I know, creepy to say as we don't know each other but, hugs sometimes help me. I know things may seem dire right now but they'll get better. They always do. It can't be worse than now, doesn't it? So treat yourself, hug your cat, watch nice happy movies and maybe sleep? Tomorrow will be a new day. And you can change things for the better. Don't lose hope.

i don't usually comment on reddit posts but dude i am SO proud of you!! super happy that you're still alive and i'm cheering for you.  personally? i've had the suspicion i've been suffering from anxiety and depression for the last few years, and my condition dropped really bad last year (had almost daily suicidal and intrusive thoughts) so i'm looking to finally get diagnosed and therapy this year! let's get it together :)

Kind of like the world, eh? You hear mostly complaints and negativity, but in reality the vast majority of people are good. Negative sticks with us - its the way our brains are wired to keep us safe. It's important to remind yourself (and others!) that things are not as bad as they seem. Thanks for the post!  
It is a microcosm of humanity at large. A little of every flavor,  all ice cream in the end.  And yeah, Hermione is great!

are the majority of people good?  
I think the majority of people are selfish. I think that deep down, most people will do what’s good for them. It so happens that having others think highly of you is important to most people, so I think most people will act civilized, friendly, and project that they are good, outwardly anyhow.

I made a post about weight loss just to be harassed and called fat anyways and then posted the same thing on another sub unrelated to weight loss and everyone was so sweet. What a wild world.  
Sorry people were mean - mean-spirited people are all over. But it's true u can find just as many people who are genuinely happy for someone else's happiness. Good luck on ur journey. If I may, I'm part of the following subs and people there are really supportive:    r/intermittentfasting, r/keto, r/HealthyFood, r/yoga  
Check out r/omad for you lovely fasters out there

How immature would you have to be to crap on someone for losing weight? As long as you put effort into it you are worthy of respect and admiration.  I hope the weight loss works out for you.

This one in fact, my post might have just been unwanted but I wanted to talk about how proud I was of losing some weight but I got a lotta shitty messages and a few rude commenters.

Sounds like the unhappy people were scrounging that subreddit just looking to hurt people.  I've experienced something similar recently in an AskReddit thread asking the most insensitive question you've ever been asked; an ex-convict drug addict spent around 4 days telling me on reddit he was glad my child died.  Hurt people try to hurt people.  
Just read your post, I can’t believe someone would say something so awful. I am sorry they were so awful, and I’m sorry for your loss.

Truth. It reminds me of old school internet forums - and i think a big part of that is not having visuals, the most we get is a username and then we have to do the leg work ourselves.  Character being shown here by actions not appearance. It’s sorely needed these days.  
u/Johnny_Beeee brought up old school forums (BBS is old school forum, right?) too! On Reddit, u realize u have connections w strangers and that we're all more similar than we think, it's seeing each other but not with our eyes.

I defected from Faecesbook (U.K. spelling) and it's made my life better. Sick of the selfie absorbed nature of that platform. Reddit is superior in so many ways.  
I recently deleted mine because of all the insane posts I was seeing surrounding the Coronavirus situation. It's been a couple of weeks and I don't miss it one bit!

Reddit is the best when you get your feed curated to topics that appeal to your hobbies as well as those things that warm your heart up.  
Or. If you're a masochist - get you riled up!  
Aye. I’ve been trying to avoid Popular for that reason. If I wanted to make my blood boil, I’d just read the news.

My favourite thing about reddit is that you can get excellent advice or priceless help from someone, but their username will be cum_pumping_porkchopsandwiches42069 or something

Yeah. When you think about it it's pretty cool. Spirit of the internet and all that. But to be fair this kinda thing has been around since the BBS days. In case ur a young un - BBS is bulletin board service. I actually sent an email to Microsoft once (a long long time ago) telling them they should consider getting a website!  
Internet culture of chatting w stranger is pretty new to me. It's not like I was unfamiliar being online, I'd Bing stuff for school and chat on AIM, but for like max an hour each day bc dial-up. I hear from friends what Reddit was like early on or what chatrooms were like in the 90s and the consensus seems to be that it was a special place. I don't know what Reddit was like before Ellen Pao (or really her impact but I feel like she did the best she could, don't hate me) and Reddit continues to be special.

I really think that this is a social media were people can relax because no one recognise you. So you say what you want with no problems  
It's like a place where there's no judgement except there is bc we're all human and we all have our biases and sometimes we can't help but judge, but also lots of people are like, ok wait, let me check myself.

What's the first sub? Five users, 11 years, and zero content. I like Reddit because you don't have to put your real name. I follow the topics that interest me and I do try to help when I can. I can also be an asshole sometimes, just depends on the day. I never come to Reddit to try to be one, but sometimes people get the better of me and it happens. It's cool though, it doesn't really bother me. Sometimes it's like, I give what I get, but mostly I try to give more (help) than I get and that wins out.

I get to learn at least one new thing a day, usually by accident, thanks to Reddit.

Agreed. I really enjoy learning from some of the groups. Plus it helps give insight into the different challenges people face and if you can help in some small way, then you get the benefit of happy hormones too.  
Yeah! I grew up in a pretty nonconfrontational family and I credit Reddit for helping me learn how to respectfully disagree in a convo. U can be graceful while slam dunking!  
I grew up in a confrontational family and funnily enough am a conflict avoider. I learnt that I just want to be happy. For me its not about winning and so most of the time I don't care if those around me do not agree with me. We are all entitled to our own opinions and therefore I will not force my beliefs onto you. At the same time, please do not try to enforce your beliefs onto me. As for the ultimate smackdown, still have to master that. So my go-to is silence.  
It can be fun to engage with someone who thinks differently than u, it's artful when people do it without attaching themselves to the intent of convincing someone. Still haven't figured out a way to not want to convince covid protestors without getting worked up tho.. guess we're all just works in progress.

I like Reddit better than Facebook because there's not nearly as much toxicity and none of the competition for likes. You can choose what you see in your feed instead of having content forced on you.  People actually help you instead of judging you and bullying you. I also like the anonymity. I feel much safer here as a domestic violence survivor than on Facebook where anyone can search for you and make fake profiles to get around you blocking them.  People actually care here and IMO Facebook is the worst site ever built. They punish abuse victims who make fake profiles to hide from their abusers by kicking them off. Let's not forget about how they admitted to selling users personal information and sharing data. Facebook should be shut down. I stopped using Facebook back in March and I don't miss it.

Yes, it's great for explanations, advice (not relationship advice), and sharing of experiences and whatnot. On the other hand, Reddit is horrible for it's political atmosphere.

Stay away from default subs, stay away from subs meant to incite negative feelings, and staying away from bigger subs are pretty good ways to make your reddit life easier.

I left Reddit a few years ago because it started to really hurt me.  But I came back 2 months ago with the explicit purpose of trying to find people being kind,  funny,  informative and supportive.  Reddit has delivered.

I firmly believe that any “content predictive” social media is your responsibility. For example Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr all give suggestions based on what you like, follow, and view. I’ve never understood how anyone could not like them - they are literally curated by you. If you don’t like something on your feed, thumb it down.  If you follow politics subs, you know exactly what you’re getting into. If you follow things like r/kindvoice or any similarly positive subs, you’ll see just how kind people can be. Choose what you want, adjust to your needs, and then accept it.

I couldn't agree more. After a long abusive and toxic relationship, I found myself wanting to isolate completely to avoid connection. It's been that way for over a year now, but Reddit makes me feel like I'm not completely alone. It's at the very least, some form of human contact on a daily basis, whether or not I take part personally. Might sound weird, but I truly don't know where I'd be without it.

Try switching from r/roastme to r/toastme. It’s interesting how much more popular roastme is, but a good exercise to follow the other one. I think a lot of terrible things that should never be comments. As long as we all treat each other as we would irl, reddit is great!

Another downside of reddit is, it brings out the closet jerks. They wouldn't dare do it to your face, but on reddit, it's open season for them. I'm relatively new on here, and it didn't take long before I was pulled into a toxic conversation. Thank you OP for this thread. Made me feel much better.  Here's to a peaceful reddit coexistence. Cheers!

AR + AI = future of cooking (I might finally avoid burning my pizza)
I love it. It would totally make cooking multitasking easier and I love having the recipe handy. Understand the concerns about safety with hot liquids etc, but if the glasses/headset are relatively small then I do not see a difference from people who have to wear regular glasses + the extra info and overlays. Pretty cool!  
It is quite a neat idea, when I cook to this day I print out recipes as using a phone while cooking is a terrible experience for me. It would in theory be possible to measure the temperature of containers using already existing tehnology like IR cameras or laser thermometers and display them in realtime.  
A "no screen timeout" mode would be helpful. Having to unlock the phone while my fingers are covered in flour or whatever. Not fun.  
Can be done in android via the quick settings app.

Reminds me of all the promises made by google glass. What we got in the end was a low pixel, slowly processing cyborg implant looking thing that was bad at everything  
Has development on Google Glass and similar products stopped permanently? I had forgotten about it.

Google glass ended up being use in warehouses or something, but not for regular consumers. The technology isn't quite there yet. Most of these have a really big lens on them, on at least 1 eye. They don't look great. There are a bunch of smart glasses, but I don't think they are true AR. I think they just overlay cell phone info on top of real life, I don't think it's 'scanning' your environment or reacting to it or anything like in this video

!RemindMe in 3 months when Apple comes out with there AR tech and ends up surprising everyone who thought that development of such products was stopped permanently, and then people will proceed to say “ but that’s not REAL AR, that’s just VR because you can’t see through “ Yes you will be able to see through, it will just end up being high resolution cameras on the outside actually reconstructing an image of your surroundings and showing that to your eyes in such realistic and calculated way that it just feels like glasses, and the headset will embed realistic virtual objects into your projected reality in a realistic way, they won’t have transparency to them like this video, it will look like the virtual things are actually just as much of an object as everything else.

This tech is right around the corner.  It'll be great for those that want it and those that fear this sort of chance can just leave it alone.  
I think it's still quite a long way off. I worked on a smart fridge proof of concept only a couple of years ago. It used a top brand fridge that had built in video cameras inside, which are designed to provide a feed of the contents, which we could access via API. We were attempting to create an application whereby you could be suggested recipes based on the contents of your fridge.  What we learned was that even with cloud-based machine-learning based on massive data sets of food images, it was enormously difficult to reliably recognise foods.  Recognising 1 tomato on an empty shelf? Not too bad a problem. But who the hell has that scenario? A plastic wrapped container of tomatoes is how they are usually bought and it never recognised it. The reflection off the plastic, the multiple tomatoes, not seeing a full tomato - it hardly ever worked.  Even more issues with something like minced meat, which comes in plastic trays here (UK). Is it lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, pork? It had no idea and no way to tell. Not that it could tell it was a tray of minced meat anyway.  Then put those things all next to each other like a standard shelf, in various rotations, states of wrapped or unwrapped, half eaten (think whole vs half-used cucumber) and all the other permutations that the human mind deals with easily and there's so much to still overcome.  Unless there's some fully accepted visual recognition method on all packages and food types, or NFC or an equivalent, it's going to be very challenging to recognise foods in everyday circumstances. Barcodes can't be used as they are often hidden from view. QR is the same. NFC is very costly on a scale this large - on every single product? Forget about that. Image recognition of brands and packaging is practically impossible, given rotations, folding, regular brand packaging changes etc.  Like us, you can probably get something working in a highly controlled demo (eg 1 tomato and 1 cucumber on a shelf, in perfect conditions). But making a significantly leap beyond that with common food goods looks very difficult to me.  
AR + AI = future of cooking (I might finally avoid burning my pizza)
I think this has so many awesome applications beyond cooking as well. Imagine it helping you change your tire, or fix a leak in your kitchen. This kind of tech could empower people to be so much more self-sufficient.

bro this is less utopian than looking at a screen all day  
did you just mix up dystopian with utopian or am I missing something here  
can you explain to me how you think putting cooking recipes on a heads up display is somehow "dystopian?" why are ai fanbros obsessed with shoe-horning "utopian," "dystopian," and "agi" into every place that they don't belong? what do you even think the word dystopian means?  seriously.  you're trying to call someone out on word meanings.  have some of your own medicine.  explain yourself without insults or dodges.  
bro this is less utopian than looking at a screen all day  
Like you do now?  
Utopian  
what do you think that word means?  
The opposite of dystopian  
Amusingly, that isn't correct, and also isn't an answer. What do you think both of those words mean, now? I'd appreciate if you tried to give a straight, complete answer, which isn't cut and pasted from a dictionary.

How so?  
In the same way that wearing AR goggles while going for a stroll in the park is dystopian - it introduces a digital film in between you and the real world that mostly serves to isolate you from the actual experience you're having without providing much benefit. All I see in this gif is a bunch of digital noise that mostly just gets in the way of the task at hand. Like...wtf is up with the dots on the sheet pan? The whole thing struck me as a bit absurd, but that part was just comical. For most, baking is a leisure activity that provides an opportunity to do something active and creative with your own two hands. Adding a digital filter for the questionable benefit of very slim improvements in efficiency just seems like piling on tech for the sake of using tech. To me this is like someone using AR to highlight exactly where they should adjust the blanket to tuck their kids into bed. Just...why? Sometimes it's ok to step back and just exist in the real world for a bit rather than allow software engineers to clutter your eyeballs with digital noise. Dystopian is a strong word. I just find the unnecessary injection of tech into simple, analog experiences to be distressing in the way that it is yet another step towards a retreat from the physical world into a digital one, and the physical isolation that comes with that.  
 it introduces a digital film in between you and the real world that mostly serves to isolate you from the actual experience you're having without providing much benefit.  You know what is a digital film in between me and the real world? Having to constantly run across the kitchen to consult my phone for what size measuring spoons I need.

Nope. This is not what we need. Having an interface between you and a boiling pot of water or an oven over 300’F will injure and maim people. Totally irresponsible.  
nope why so negative ar glasses would be useful in infinite ways, do you love looking at a screen ? most people don't, It's something we are forced to do I'd love to attend classes/meetings while on a walk outside get turn by turn directions while driving. instructions for when I'm working on a car this isn't VR, it's AR it's coming whether you like it or not because it's going to be incredibly useful  
I’m not negative. I stream a twitch channel with leela chess zero 24/7. The future is bright but for me some things are immersive enough and the “fall but get back up” are key teaching moments. Making mistakes is how humans learn and cooking is one non critical life skill I prefer learning in pure reality.  I have a similar view to tasks like playing the piano etc You can learn to do something without understanding why

AR + AI = future of cooking (I might finally avoid burning my pizza)
Pointless. Not everything needs a tech injection... and cooking is one of them. Unless it can tell an unskilled cook when to flip a steak, what the temp is their cooking over, or when the food is done... this is just an AR recipe with guiding markers.

My problem with this is  Most people wouldn't want to wear glasses during all of their waking hours. Like someone isn't going to be "oh I'm going to cook now, so I better grab my glasses or put in ar contacts because I can't use 90% of the tech out there which let's me know all of this stuff." people like me who wears glasses 24/7 would love this. But others? I seriously doubt it. Some can't wear glasses for one reason or another. There is people today in USA that get paid so little that they have to go into debt even without doing anything but work, eat, sleep. And if they don't go in debt they can't afford the basics. Basically the middle class is shrinking and most are going into poverty or heading there.   While cool. I doubt this is around the corner like most once thought  
 Most people wouldn't want to wear glasses during all of their waking hours.  I would definitely leave a pair of these in the kitchen.  I do not wear glasses in general.  These would be super useful when I was trying cooking an unfamiliar cuisine. I don't think you have to wear these all day.    Some can't wear glasses for one reason or another.  Don't make your product, because people exist who can't use it!   That's why nobody's ever invented pants, is because some people don't have legs. Maybe after they solve illiteracy, I can get rich by inventing the pencil.    There is people today in USA that get paid so little that they have to go into debt even without doing anything but work, eat, sleep.   Don't make your product, because poor people exist!    I doubt this is around the corner   It's already here, dude.  You can buy this.  
 I would   I doubt anyone here is the average person. I would love this too. But I have to be honest.   I don't think you have to wear these all day.  Likely if it had that much function then it could help with your day to day.

This tech is going to make people so dumb and useless if it becomes ubiquitous. As an assistant for people with handicaps it's great but we should not need to automate cognitive tasks like identifying which item in front of us is the salt and how much the recipe says we should use. This is effectively taking something we use our brains for and externalizes it with technology.  The brain operates on a use it or lose it principle. If you've ever studied math and then not done it for a while or even stopped reading books for a year and then gone back to it, you know what I mean. Even these seemingly automatic processes like retrieval and working memory have flexible capacities and if we are overreliant on externalizing them our capacities will be reduced.  
That's what they said about Wikipedia, too.  They were wrong then, too.  
Were they?  
Yes.  These things are easily measured, and asking vague questions without trying to isn't useful.

i dont understand, where's the AI?

The concept is neat already but I can see a future where you'd be able to detect if certain ingredients are ripe (based on the visuals) or expired.  
This would be super hard to do without color calibration, which requires extra hardware But also super, super useful - especially at the grocer.  Something like half of veg can be done visually. I think this is actually a really good idea  
Thanks. As with most things the execution would be the tough part (especially since you often have to use other senses like touch or smell to analyze produce.

interesting. the only folks that are screaming dangerous a i are the same billionaires making bank using it  
This might be a dumb question, but why is that interesting? wouldn’t they be the ones that see how powerful even our current meh AI are? i would honestly expect them to not say anything about the dangers, to not call attention to what makes them money  
interesting. the only folks that are screaming dangerous a i are the same billionaires making bank using it  
Totally agree, the biggest danger I see so far is using AI to create even more inequality. In order words, concentrating AI only in the hands of the few.  
in time. all will catch up to understanding a i and the mystery will move on to something else  
Hypothetical scenario where AI research can be very quickly concentrated in the hands of the few: the government takes Elon Musk and similar people seriously in their claims that AI can be very dangerous and decides to allow AI research only in private or academic labs certified and overseen by a government regulator. Not too unrealistic since areas like atomic energy research are treated in a similar way.

On a more serious note, I believe in a future of “human-machine symbiosis” where we can combine the strengths of both human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Human can solve some intellectual problems that AI cannot, and vice versa. Such a collaborative symbiotic entity would be superior than any of the individuals. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-Computer_Symbiosis  
The AI will answer questions but we got to think of what to ask it.

I'm 99% sure we could do this now. Image recognition is pretty good already, so it's just a matter of tracing the borders of the recognized object, and filling them in with a black, or static background, or whatever you want. OP probably needs to train his more.  
OP isn't trying to replace objects with black/static.  They're trying to fill in the scene behind the cars.

There's a paper on post estimation that gets over this flickering problem via some sort of smoothing in time series data. I forgot what it is, but would solve a bunch of the issues here.  
Wouldn't an adversarial setup do it? The flickering should be a dead giveaway to the post-processor that it's fake. In theory anyway.

Could someone please explain how this is being done? Assume I understand perceptrons, weight, and bias at a certain level and have made basic convnets with keras so far.  
Paraphrasing the developer:  The A.I. I use here isn't itself novel, I've adapted the code from two open-source repositories on GitHub. The vehicle detection is the same type as that which is used in self-driving cars. I detect and then remove vehicles using the code from a recent paper called Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion. This model is trained on the Places2 dataset by MIT which contains a lot of images of outdoor places, I hoped therefore it would be able to bias the filling in of the cars towards more natural scenes.

This can’t be perfect now, but what is it for?  
According to the developer himself:  In part a response following the global movements to mitigate and rally against climate-change (Extinction Rebellion). In part stemming from my own personal abhorrence of the obnoxiousness of cars in what should be pedestrian friendly environments and the desire to live in greater harmony with nature. I dream of being rid of the pollution, the obstacles, but most of all for me personally, as someone who is highly sensitive, it's the cacophony of sounds and jarring relentlessness of a constant flow of traffic.  The future of cities is good public transport, bikes and walkable streets. I see no need for the regular use of cars inside densely populated cities.

Depends also on how image editing is done. Simple stretching and compressing is to a degree reversible (notably back in 2007 child abuser "Swirl Face" was caught when German investigators reconstructed his face and he was identified). Most smoothing filters are not reconstructible simply because the original data is lost.

There was an iOS app that was removed from the App Store called Instagram Reality. You could make a second twitter account and just tweet photos at the bot and that should suffice. Also, this only highlights altered facial areas- not any photoshop.

Yep.

It will be interesting to know what tech they're using. I wonder are they using NERFs for some of it.

Fully autonomous cars are decades away from being common and accessible to the public, if they happen at all. I wouldn't worry about them. Besides, 30 years ago people thought flying cars would be a common thing by now. We decided otherwise.  
You know a decade ago your opinion was mainstream, you would be upvoted back then. Pessimists now days have to go like: "it'll be YEARS away before it becomes mainstream" to seem smarter than everyone else.  
I'm being optimistic, actually. Personally, I don't think fully autonomous self-driving vehicles for public purchase will ever be a thing. The idea is going to go up in smoke just like the idea of flying cars did. There are too many variables and safety issues. The tech/AI is also simply not there or not cost-effective (and it doesn't look like it ever will be). Even smartphones (which billions of people are buying and using daily) are getting more expensive. I suspect there will be autonomous public transport and "encouragement" or incentives for people not to own personal vehicles (because it reduces congestion and helps the environment... also reduces loss of life).  
You have no idea what you're talking about. It's ridiculous to compare flying cars with autonomous cars because the technology for autonomous cars actually exists today... There already exists autonomous cars that are way safer than any human driver today, what are these saftey issues you are talking about? They dont have to be perfect, they just have to be better than humans, which they are by far. And the opposite is true regarding the price of technology. It is getting way cheaper as time goes on... The reasons some phones are expensive is because the quality is getting significantly better as well. In a few years, phones with the same capacity will be dirt cheap.

Many technological advances in humanity have been made solely because we were working out better ways to kill each other. One of the first ever innovations was sharpening and hardening the end of a stick.  
I'm just saying. No murder robots until I get a self-driving car that actually works. That's my policy.  
Many technological advances in humanity have been made solely because we were working out better ways to kill each other. One of the first ever innovations was sharpening and hardening the end of a stick.  
Except sharpening and hardening of a stick can be used for a variety of things vs killing people. For tents, for games, for tools, for food, you can thus make something of use with a knife or a spear. But you can't use a gun to fish, to carve, or to build. You can only use it to destroy. if that's someone's first choice with an AI, the problem is with the person, not all of humanity  
You can use it for other things, sure. But my money is on it being used for killing first.   
Out of all the things that could be done with intelligent robots why is killing one of the first that we go after?

Could be, if they are a better shot than humans and manage to avoid collateral damage.  
In theory, you can leverage these abilities without foregoing human supervision, basically having a human clearing targets for elimination either ahead of time, or in real-time with some sort of feed from the robot.

 There is no avoiding collateral damage in an unsupervised system. Innocent people, children, would die due to bugs or simply the unpredictable nature of a calculative decision making process.  And here you have arrived at the same philosophical point as driverless cars... There is no 100% "avoiding" harm with robot cars either. They just have to do better than humans. The process... the bugs... If despite all these, the robot soldier kills fewer innocents / causes less collateral damage, then how can you, morally, not support it?

The progress that could happen is that the burden of responsibility in case of fuck ups could be transferred to orders-givers. A robot won't shoot civilians unless ordered to do so.

Aspiring janitors will downvote this.  
I use to be a janitor. I can tell you a few problems with this robot. Like some bathrooms are horrible, and some people smear shit on everything like they are drugged out or something. And if someone shits in a sink (it happens) I don't see how this will clean it. ​ With that being said, I always hate cleaning bathrooms when I was a janitor. I never heard of one liking to clean the bathrooms. Outside of that, I loved being one. But obviously it depends on your boss. Like I've heard of some if the boss found 1 hair on the ground, then they would get yelled at.  
Residential robot vacuums can recognize and navigate around pet poop on floors these days, so I suspect these commercial bathroom robots will have computer vision models that will be trained to recognize and ask for assistance when messes are unusually large or in unusual places.

So instead of taking a janitors job, perhaps it will make a janitors job easier/more efficient. Robots should work with us not replace us  
Absolutely. They are tools to aid in force multiplication. They aren't a replacement for creativity or the subjective experiences that we all have and can use towards contribution of new ideas that shape the very fabric of our realities.

Just imagine some poor Ai Tech consultant in the future having to try and train their Janitor bot to clean out that sink. When I lifeguarded as a teen, we were tasked with cleaning the locker-rooms during the day and that included cleaning up the very types of messes you mentioned. Someone even bounced a tennis ball into it too once for good measure.    Even the Janitor Ai's are gonna need some sort of broader general intelligence in order to handle the unpredictable shit human beings subject each other to lol

Agi doesn't automate jobs, they automate humans as a whole. The new jobs it might create are also automated.  Also, not everyone is intelligent enough to become engineers or occupy the few jobs which will continue to exist.  My responsibility will solely be to put food on the table, to many, that will mean sabotaging the bots taking their jobs. If you don't want to live in a collapsing hellscape, you should stop pushing the "retrain" garbage. Its not going to work this time..

He also makes appearances in some of the Computerphile videos, which are definitely worth a sub for the computer enthusiast.

Yeah , those videos are annoying because they claim that only one issue with AI exists and all the others are bogus. Like we aren’t gonna run into superintelligence  for a while , and “dumb” ANI can do a lot , so we have a bit to worry about now.  But 70% of AI researchers in this survey of 352 were concerned with artificial super intelligence. All I’m saying is that there are several issues with AI , not just one .  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08807.pdf

I mean, it's not like Eminem usually battles against good rappers anyway.  
Eminem likes to beef with artists who can't hit back. Brittany Spears, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet Boys, ICP, Machine Gun Kelly, N'Sync. It's really pathetic he just bullies the least intimidating people in music he's too afraid to go after a real rapper.  
No, I would more say that those are the idiots that start beef with him. He doesn't go after people, he just claps back when someone says something. The problem is real rappers know they'll get deleted by Eminem and they recognize him as one of the greats. They don't go after him out of respect.

Here are the full exchanges. I wasn’t planning on posting anything when I started the prompts, so I’m sure there’s a better, more deliberate way I could have gone about this. I was just messing around  I may try again as I learn more about the most effective way to provide prompts, though

Based on updates after launch of GPT-4 model, here I am summarizing the comparison between ChatGPT & Bard. 1.The Large Language Model (LLM) used by ChatGPT has a greater number of parameters compared to the LLM used by Bard. 2.Bard does not have the ability to retain information from previous conversations. When given a prompt, Bard can provide several different responses. 3.The information available to ChatGPT is limited to a specific date and does not include any information added after that date. 4.Bard is currently not capable of writing or generating computer code. In more latest developments, ChatGPT announced Plugin Support that enhance it’s capability to next level. There are plugins like code interpret that helps in solving mathematical problems. Whereas google offers significant improvements in math & logical capabilities with PaLM Model. So we are in middle of Journey, However ChatGPT performs well at the moment.  
Why does this sound like something a Chatbot would say...

Awful  Only a googleplex manchild would put this garbage out. Ai is not friggin sentient.    And do not tell me please that when you when you read those lyrics that it didn't sound like a white person wrapping it in your mind while you were reading the lyric. That's fine at all and I'm not anti-White and I am white but I mean this is like revenge of the nerds an error white rap like this is just so corny in the end of the s***** tack my boy like oh Hey the round way with say and the rest of it's just nonsense oh cool yeah that's f****** that's the most amazing s*** and I've f****** ever seen. I want to go listen to tupac and Kendrick to clean my ears out. This s's garbage Google doesn't know what the f they're talking about and whatever Microsoft... allbthe other douchebags lying about "sentient" c3po. Trash. I don't respect these lying mega companies alligator.  I didn't REALLLLY before..  But after a lot of their products like Google search going to h*** and just the obvious lack of respect towards people's intelligence with some of this robotic AI whatever nonsense I just I don't want to mess with this s*** anymore for a really long time I don't take any of these companies seriously the way I used to.

Probably both. Natural Language Processing is definitely AI. But I don't know if the answers are generated on the Spot.  
They 100% are not. The closest thing to natural language generation in chatbot being used today is some form of templating ( which is barely NLG). The AI used is just NLP and likely some sort of knowledge graph search.  
I think the NLP is used to find the appropriate hand-made template but probably not design them from scratch.

The fact that you even posted this comment shows how uninformed you are.  They are absolutely, 100%, without a doubt scripted. There is no "opinion" about it.  
There's no reason to take such an aggressive tone to someone asking a question and stating their guess. You could have just said "You're right, they're scripted." /u/SpitFire92: please don't escalate the issue by retaliating with swear words.

You could say the same criticism for a person using an popular idiom. Language when you break it down is scripting concepts to be used ahead of time.

I’ve been thinking about this for year.  Take For example game of thrones. You could take a scene and break it up into stills. Then use them to remove people from the scene. Then take the people-less pictures to render a 3D environment allowing people to walk the set.  
You know they just have the models though right?  
What do you mean? Are you talking about the models used to create the backgrounds etc?  I’m talking about using the final video of the show. This way you have all the details that are digitally added. And the user gets the experience of the final world. But GOT is just an example used because everyone knows that show. You could using the same technique recreate the deck of the Enterprise in the original Star Trek or recreate the bedroom from Hitchcock’s Rear window.  Since the entire move is shot in that room.  But there is little record of it.  It could also be used in crime analysis. This was done with the Boston bombing. They crowd sourced video and pictures and sticked it all together to figure out what happened.  Lots of potential.

Open source will catch up to the models. But it won’t touch the brand recognition and infrastructure lead OpenAI/Microsoft and Google have when it comes to serving millions of users. Sure, you can download a Llama clone and run it on your PC. But can you build a scalable business around it? Much easier to make an API call.

I don’t think so. Right now everyone keeps their state of the art models to themselves and dumps their leftover garbage on huggingface. The open source AI scene is not as robust as people think.

Opensource is not just dudes in basements, there's many companies and universities with a lot of cash to dump on hardware.

This meme doesn't really make sense considering Google has already acknowledged internally via a leaked memo that Open source is going to run laps around both themselves and OpenAI and neither of them have any solution or plan to stop it. Hence the panicked visit to Washington.  I know a lot of people are identifying the obvious profit impact... but their are some legitimate concerns with this kind of technology just being out there now.

i agree but i dont see how the opensource community can excel at collaborationg without hardware to run it thats easy when its something like an os for a pc but we are talking about something that takes 1000 normal gpu's just to run one prompt and even more to train it in a reasonble timeframe  
There are already platforms for doing exactly that.

According to googles memo hardware isn't an issue. They are finding surprising ways to make this stuff operate quicker on smaller platforms. Even phone hardware. Google sounded fairly freaked out honestly.

They are banking on forcing every ai developer to do things like provide proof an image or text was created by ai. This will be forced on open source devs soon. My guess is the regs will artificially increase the barrier to entry to a point where the Vast majority of people won't be able to participate without being subject to imprisonment.

How the hell can “open source” get around the millions of dollars in compute necessary to train modern networks  
Corporations have a certain way they operate. There is a hiearchy. There is a certain focus they demand that results in a highly capable but constrained approach that open source won't be hobbled by. It isn't so much an issue of hardware but "mindware". If you have a thousand of the best minds dedicated to certain tasks that are constrained by the desires of corporate, that may not achieve break through developments as quickly or effeciently as ten thousand unrestrained open source minds.  And to be clear this opensource performance didn't appear out of thin air. All of it was based on the leak of Facebook's Llamma model. From that foundation opensource has sprinted ahead and will continue to do so.  
i dont see how when it takes huge capital to create the hardware this isnt linux vs windows on your home pc  
i think this the only thing holding back the open source the hardware cost.  
If we can keep the hardware market alive and growing (whilst preventing companies like Google and Microsoft from cornering it), eventually the hardware will fall into our hands due to advances in manufacturing and cost reduction. I know, big ask, right? On top of this, the amount of time advanced AI spends exclusively in the hands of powerful companies is also a problem.  Let’s just hope there’s enough of the open source guys working on this to try and use it to come up with better solutions. This CAN end well, but we have to get as many AI into as many hands as possible if we are to link up and crowd source acceleration.  
They want to take LLMs away from the public.  
i think this the only thing holding back the open source the hardware cost.  
You don't need huge computation unless you're serving a large number of people, building and training a new model or preforming extremely complicated calculations. Most ai tasks for a home could be done on a $2000 computer. Not cheap, but tech gets cheaper every year

Can you explain (ELI5, if you care) why the main image composition remains the same throughout all transfomations?  
the neural network is looking for similarities in the the data and generating new data within those parameters.   A big chunk of the dataset is generated images that were dark on the edges and uniform colors in the center.   I created part of the dataset by generating 12,000 images over successive training cycles then I created a grid of colored squares that are dark on the edges then used a photomosaic program called andreamosaic to place my generated images on the grid. then used photoshop to cut them back into squares and visipics to deduplicate.  
Man. Appreciate your response. Kind of sure that at some point I'll understand what it all means

I understood the first part, but could you elaborate on the second part?  You used images that where generated by the GAN to supplement your dataset, ok, but what is that about a grid and squares and cutting images in squares? Is that some kind of augmentation technique? Also still not sure what exactly you did there. I can’t really visualize the last part well.  place my generated images on the grid. then used photoshop to cut them back into squares and visipics to deduplicate.  You basically made a mosaic from the images of the dataset that resembles the generated grid square template? Why? And why cut it back into squares again after you had your mosaic? What was the point of making a mosaic in the first place and what was the point of cutting it back up? I’m sorry I have SO many questions. Awesome work you did there  
basically, i don't know how to sort images by color or patterns except manually. with 12k images it was going to take forever. but i am pretty good with photoshop so I just generated a large grid of the patterns I wanted. this enabled me to imperfectly automate the pattern sorting process

Sweet! You should look into NFT or crypto art. It is a way to make digital art works an asset that can be acquired by art collectors or displayed in virtual galleries. I recently minted a token for one of my pieces of generative art. It was more expensive than I anticipated and annoyingly complicated, but I persevered and got it done. I think it was worthwhile to learn the process.  
I would love to learn how to do that!  
I used Rarible to mint the token, which required me to get a Fortmatic wallet. First I signed up for the Fortmatic API which isn't exactly the wallet. So I used the decentralized exchange Airswap to connect to my Fortmatic wallet. Everything had to be done in ETH and my credit cards would not allow me to purchase Ethereum. So I had to use Coinbase to purchase Ethereum via a bank account withdrawal. Then that ETH had to be transferred to my Fortmatic wallet. All this requires entering codes sent via SMS or email. Then on Rarible I had to connect to my Fortmatic wallet and follow all its steps. This entire process took hours although some of the steps may have been unnecessary, like using Airswap. I also found an Ethereum Blockchain Explorer which was useful for reviewing the history of my transactions on my Fortmatic wallet address. All this needs to be done very carefully. I don't think most artists will go through all this hassle. But hopefully I have gotten in on the ground floor of something that will become big. According to the Ethereum Blockchain Explorer I now have a RARI token of which there are 17,714 holders with a 38,724 max total supply. I think that means I am an early adopter. ;)

It should be not 19, but “delta is 16”.. “delta is 1”.. “delta is 0”.  
It's just for showing how close you reach when you predict a data which is being tested into the machines and delivers the great outcome. If you have heard the name "Approximations" & "Round-off" they are also one and the same things!    
but why would an interviewer ask addition in an interview.  
Because in ML, you try to reach closure and closure to the actual simulation and when the machine starts responding the way we wanted, it becomes a prototype

These are essentially no different to what we've seen a lot of with AI image making, just projected onto a sphere for 360 degree perspectives that you can navigate around with your mouse... which would be useful for material baking or cube mapping. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL - it isn't a full 3D environment you can walk around in seamlessly. I'm only raising this point because it could be fairly confusing for someone who isn't paying attention to the details - what exactly is on show here and the way it is presented could easily convince someone that this is what was on offer.

Literally was about to point this out before I read this, yep. The most I could do from this is map it on a cubemap for a skybox (I use hammer still, I'm a dinosaur). Now for making backgrounds, this is great. But generating 'game environments' this is a bit wrong. Edit: Not ragging on the tool either. For what is actually does, it does well.  
Won’t be long before you can generate depth maps and then, use control net to make a few consistent panoramas from different perspectives, and finally use the multiple panoramas to build radiance fields and extract models and textures from them. Somebody smarter than me will stitch all that together in a few months, and be generating 3D models out of these simple line drawings, and probably be doing it by the end of the year.  
Totally agree. How many tools have already been compounded together in insanely creative ways? This idea feels inevitable, wouldn't be surprised if someone saw this tool and already started making what you described.

You say that like its trivial and it's not. These folks are doing cool shit. To make skyboxes traditionally you have to model the scene by hand and render it to a cubemap. Pretty much every 3d game going back to hafllife 1 uses skyboxes like this.  Prompt driven skybox design is insanely useful.  
It is not my intention to paint this as trivial. The technology behind it is amazing but not exclusive to this product. Within that context what they are doing with this product isn't all that amazing. Its a cool and interesting application, no doubt. And there are lots of ways you can make a skybox, including painting it by hand using a very similar approach in Photoshop. Make no mistake this could save lots of time. Crazy amounts of time, much like other AI related art products. My point is that these aren't 3D, fully navigable spaces based on a limited sketch across a sphere projection. It's a clarification for those who might click this and make a snap judgement about what they are seeing.  
I agree. It may be misleading to some people who don't understand that a skybox isn't a real 3d environment.

You're right, but it has me wondering whether this could be a completely different way of having an interactive environment. If this were able to get a temporal cohesive generation (and fast enough), you could have it generate new frames as you move through it. Sure it wouldn't be able to be a cohesive narrative that's designed beforehand, but you could find yourself exploring this real-time generated  environment, making up your own narrative to what is happening.  
I was thinking more something like then using image segmentation, then extrapolating it to generate 3d models kind of like how NERFs do it. Then place it back into some environment with the original generated image mapped onto it, then regenerated to be more coherent.

I wonder how hard it will be to take it further though. Estimating a depth map to project onto the sphere is probably something you could just do right now (assuming they're not already) with decent results. The training data is pretty trivial to obtain, and there's plenty of prior art for depth estimation on non-spherical images. From there, turning it into an incomplete 3D scene can be done with existing techniques (i.e. the same techniques you use for building 3D geometry with LiDAR scanning). The first issue is that anything in the immediate vicinity which is occluded from the initial POV will have holes in it which will need to be infilled. But that seems very solvable. The bigger issue is what happens when you get further away from that starting point and you need more creative input. But you can imagine a pretty clear path from the above to a system where you draw a scene, write a prompt, let the computer crunch, then walk a little distance to where large chunks are missing, sketch some more, repeat, until you have an entire walkable environment built. Don't get me wrong: there's a lot of engineering work between the video and what I just described, but I don't actually see any major breakthroughs. It's just a lot of sweat.

its just a skybox, not really a "game environment"  
Still, step in that direction. It'll get there sooner than we think  
There's a pretty large gap between image generation and world design + graphics.  I think the clarification here that they are different is spot on, and not just a "small step" between them.  
Is that because this is essentially just an AI image? So it can use masses of 2D images to generate it, like DALL-E/Midjourney. Whereas a 3D environment would require masses of 3D environments as training data, which are much harder to come by?

I don't think it's that far off really. I bet AI could get really close if you constrained it a bit. For example, have a team focus on creating assets and then train the AI to pick from those to build the world. You'd probably need a post processing step where designers come back in and clean things up a bit, but since they are working off of pre-built assets, it shouldn't be too cumbersome. I give it maybe 1-3 years before we see this sort of tech integrated into every aspect of content creation. Heck, I just used OpenAI today to write my resume for me.

Maybe I'm missing something but the initial drawing has something that looked vaguely dumpster-ish but that seems to be missing in all renderings. Still pretty cool. But the problem with a lot of the image AI is that 'cool' seems to be easy. Specific from a vision seems more difficult.

Is python really that beginner friendly?
It's unreasonable to include applications of a language in a discussion of how difficult the language is to learn. Subjects like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Math, etc. are all open-ended subject. In a sense, they are all infinitely hard since the best minds on the planet have to work hard to make new discoveries. Python is an easy to use language. My guess is that it might be the best language for someone trying to learn programming. Of course, if the plan is to enter a particular application field, one should probably just study whatever language is used in that field or whatever language those around you use so you can ask questions.

Yes, its pretty easy to learn python syntax.  Machine learning is hard because its complicated, its an advanced topic not something you should be attempting when you are just starting to learn how to code.  
I think one thing that makes the syntax of python a bit tricky in any sort of scientific computing field is that the libraries tend to be a bit… fancy with the language features. They have good justification for doing so, as it makes the code much more readable, but taking advantage of things like operator overloading does make it harder for a newbie to build a model of the language. I got started doing ML with gorgonia, since I work in Go full-time for my actual job, and predictably moved to Python (which I’m much less familiar with) because I wanted to be able to train models some time before the heat death of the universe. That initial exposure turned out to be extremely helpful though in understanding the basics, because nothing is magic in Go. It was way easier to untangle the syntactic fanciness of tensorflow having something roughly analogous to reference which I understood well. I’m definitely not saying that everyone should start out in ML with Go. I’m coming at this as a software engineer with decades of experience, and a deep existing familiarity with Go specifically. I think “learn Go, then play with toy models in gorgonia before moving onto Python” is probably an absurd detour for most people. But what I would say is: if you’re already very familiar with a language (and not very familiar with Python), and that language has some ML libraries, however anemic, it might be worth your time to play with that first before moving to Python.

How about we stop wasting good technology on gimmicks, and do something useful for a change?
Ohh those were the days where you could add .file extension to your search query or "torrent" / "stream online" and get a precise results list of some obscure forums or russian video sites where random people shared just what you were looking for. Now you get squeaky clean SEO optimised garbage and subscription services. The other day I used Google assistant to look up on the fly a quick unit conversion while cooking and it spat out a bunch of shiny food blogs. I wanted to convert from cups to metric, Google wanted me to read about someone's deceased grandma's special casserole with 12 ads hovering around her recipe.

Everyone knows search engines achieved perfection with 2006-2009 era Google. That engine was lethal--just a remorselessly efficient deep parser of global public data. The only limit was your ability to interface with it. That was why people used to say, "You're just better at googling than I am" and "google-fu," neither of which I've heard in a long time.  I would give anything to have access to it again. Now all we have is this backwashed, 'heuristic,' revenue pathway funneling garbage that tries tell you what you're searching for instead of actually parsing and ranking related information. You can't even search for mildly obscure/specific things without being second guessed and redirected to some standardized return. Honestly, I'm kind of hoping AI will solve this and, eventually, algorithms will become intuitive and powerful enough to deliver wanted results from poorly formatted and well formatted searches alike, instead of just delivering the same results for any search that includes a vaguely similar series of letters/words.  
The old SERP is still there. The bigger problem is all the SEO junk content. Google search is a victim of its own success.

I only have murmurings to back this up, but I suspect that there is less actually useful information on the internet to be indexed due to social media platforms. Instead of founding and joining independent and tailored blogs or forums, more people simply opt to post on behemoths like Reddit or Facebook, or even worse for discoverability, youtube. For instance, if nobody’s bothered to build plumbersbestwebsite.com because platforms have sucked all the oxygen for web content and attention, then there’s naturally going to be less useful information available for google to find and index.

Today I decided to try Bing's GPT-driven chat bot to help me remove ads/promos from my windows 11. It failed, eloquently.  While it was able to formulate natural language response - it has simply quoted outdated information that no longer applies. When confronted with its mistake, it apologized (with the standard boilerplate response) and then repeated the very same misinformation. ML is an ideal tool to tackle the never-ending arms race of SEO-driven content farms vs search engines. Yet, instead of tackling it, companies go for low-hanging fruit of incorporating Chat-GPT into their product and calling it a day. Would love to see some meaningful change. For a change.

This is insaneeee! I have a question about it's applications: is it possible to use this to extract information? For example if you scan a receipt could it create a digital version with each line editable?  
Yes. But you will need to a run OCR instead of the background removing application (U^2-Net)  OP is using.  
Awesome! thanks for the reply!  Completely understand if you're not able offer this, but do you know of any good, reliable OCR services? All the ones I've found, tend to be geared towards a particular functionality and after testing several they just don't live up to the standard I'm expecting

The future 🤯  
I mean, technically now it's the past.  
How can it be the past if its happening now?... id say the now its the future and past overlapping for a jiffy of a second  
Future, past, now is simply an illusion. Reality is one continuum, it can't be neatly divided into division as such. But, this kind of conceptualization might have tremendous utility in our daily life.

Ohh the nightmare of making this into a stable product... Enough to drive you mad just thinking about it  
Why would it be a nightmare?  
Well, why don't we already have cross-device AR interfaces and can swipe content between our devices seamlessly like Tony Stark? The U-net demonstrated here only provides a means to extract relevant sections of image data. The rest that needs to be done for this demo is far more difficult. Roughly, you need to identify the other device through the camera or NFC, pinpoint the relative position of the two devices for the onscreen insertion position, match the other device to a Bluetooth device or wifi connected device securely, set up a transfer, communicat data type and decide what should happen with the data... and do all of this across different OS and devices with different standards, handle poor connection, communicate all the issues to the user in a foolproof way. You can force the user to setup some of this manually, but then you'll loose 99% of the users and the product won't gain enough support/funding and gets dropped like a pair of Google glasses.  
Yeah man and this all those companies fault who use different standard for every fucking thing (microsoft and apple looking at u) .

You just need to run some visualbasic to check the camera on the phone to know where on the pc it's pointing to, then send that image to the pc with the coords to paste the amethyst. I can do this with one weekend.

[D] A Demo from 1993 of 32-year-old Yann LeCun showing off the World's first Convolutional Network for Text Recognition
The fact that they also had to know the location of the numbers and that the algorithm was robust to scale changes is impressive for 1993 It's not like they just solved MNIST in 1993, it's one step above that  
I guess too many people underestimate what could be accomplished with a little and tons of passion and time  
Yes. Back then, the proportion of developers who could hand-write a new graphics algorithm in assembler or C was considerably higher, since that was often how it was done anyway. Necessity is a great motivator. The non-ML part of this problem is more tedious than difficult.  
Has this changed really ? :) In number of engineers with these skills, certainly, in proportion of developers, this remains to be seen. Python is the syntactic sugar but who goes really in and looks under the rug ?

Today's software are thousands times less efficient, because of all the overhead have been added layers on top of layes don't do any real work. Think about after all the closest, cabinets, drawers, boxes, organizers and wrappers, you still get the same pair of old socks and everyone cheers: "Yeah! It works! We got the socks!", that's what modern software actually is. But thank to these overhead, this industry have enough investment to support millions of overpaid software engineers, and most important of all, thousands of billionaires.

I guess they had a preprocessing step to identify, center and scale each digit image before feeding into the neural network. It’s not that hard with feature engineering.  
Maybe I’m misunderstanding, but isn’t the whole point of CNNs that the location of the digits doesn’t matter?

The video has lots of cuts, and the numbers never obscures an important part of the image...    I suspect each of those tests had tweaking and tuning to make it work...  
This system ended up deployed in banks to parse written checks, so I don't think it was tweaked just for these examples, but they did expect to have fully visible digits.  
Did LeCunn make a lot of money from it?

I have had the privilege to attend professor Yann's classes at NYU.  From whatever little I understand of him - he has high levels of integrity, and I do not see him trying some cheap tweaks and fixes...He was committed to solve a problem in the best way possible and not just for likes and hearts ☺️. And without that level of integrity, you can't go from lab to national level in short time.

And yet websites still think those obfuscated texts are a good test for robots  
there is a reason why captcha is becoming obsolete. At least the text based version. Also, captcha actually digitize books. This is why there are 2 tests, not 1. So in a sense, we were training the robots filling the captchas.  
Yeah, on a PHPBB forum I manage, the bots can get through the text-based captchas very easily. But they still struggle with simple questions like "In what State is this club based?"

It serves two purposes. It defeats 99.99% of bots, and it maps images to human inputs to train their image recognizer networks.  
As I make my living making bots and doing automation, captcha is just part of the job. Solving captcha isn’t a special thing.  
That sounds fun. You have a site or a blog?  
And yet websites still think those obfuscated texts are a good test for robots  
I don’t think it’s meant to filter that way. Bots usually are built with speed in mind so it recognises and fills in the blanks virtually immediately. That and captchas are also useful for labelling training datasets manually (user input). But correct me if I’m wrong though.  
You’re definitely correct about the captchas. It’s no coincidence that most of the objects they ask you to recognize are cars, crosswalks etc. They basically get free labor to help them build a giant dataset fir training self driving cars.

Unless someone cares enough about your little website to train an AI to solve your captcha they're still not a terrible idea. I don't think there are any AIs that are generic enough to solve all obfuscated text captchas yet. Obviously it's not going to work for large sites but none of them use that method anymore anyway.

Many don’t know it, but before it was done such text recognition was considered impossible, just like AGI and other hard problems. I think text recognition in mail was the first successful real world application of AI.  
err, Kurzweil had an OCR product in 1976: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil#Mid-life  
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't normal font imply a "set font" rather than handwritten characters? Still impressive but a different problem from MNIST and generally reading the messy writing of humans.  
In the wiki page (I put it at the right chapter) they state it was supposed to be "omni-font" as in reading all types of text, while older systems only recognized some set fonts. Note that there were already functional devices. Of course, those probably were of much worse quality than LeCun's small CNN, I just wanted to point out the person I'm responding to is full of shit.

 Many don’t know it, but before it was done such text recognition was considered impossible  By the time LeCun did this, text recognition was common at banks for scanning checks, in children's toys, and was the basis of the Cue:CAT. You're making this up. OCR was common by the early 1970s, almost 30 years before this.  
cuecat was a barcode scanner. Never did anything resembling text recognition. Nor were there any children's toys in the 90s or before that did anything of the sort (though they might do interesting stuff to convince children that they could!). And check recognition worked by "cheating" — first, using a special typeface with super easily distinguished characters and uniform size and spacing, and second, printing it with magnetic ink so that the scanner didn't have to find the data it wanted among any kind of visual background. Everything except the routing and account numbers was invisible to it.

Uh.  Sorry, no. The CNN was invented by Hubel and Weisel in 1959, the year before Yann LeCun was born, under the name "neocognitron."  LeCun also didn't make them first. The CNN was first implemented by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, 14 years before this video (Reference translated is Journal of the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers A Vol.J62-A No.10 pp.658-665, October 25, 1979, ISSN 0373-6091) What Yann LeCun actually brought to the party was the modern approach to training them.  He did that in 1984, not 1993.  
You are NOT correct about Hubel and Weisel. Hubel and Weisel did research on visual cortex in real brains (in cats) and it was awesome (they got Nobel Prize for it). But they did not invent CNNs. You can read their paper [1] you don't have to be a biologists to understand most of it. From their work one can deduce what neurons in V1 do. It was later even verified that some of these neurons realize functions similar to Gabor filters, but (as I remember) that was even later then neocognitron. It is true that their findings did inspire creators of neocognitron [2] but that's about it. [1] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1363130/pdf/jphysiol01298-0128.pdf [2] Fukushima, Kunihiko, and Sei Miyake. "Neocognitron: A self-organizing neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition." Competition and cooperation in neural nets. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1982. 267-285.  
Uh.  Sorry, no. The CNN was invented by Hubel and Weisel in 1959, the year before Yann LeCun was born, under the name "neocognitron."  LeCun also didn't make them first. The CNN was first implemented by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, 14 years before this video (Reference translated is Journal of the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers A Vol.J62-A No.10 pp.658-665, October 25, 1979, ISSN 0373-6091) What Yann LeCun actually brought to the party was the modern approach to training them.  He did that in 1984, not 1993.  
And to add to this, people thought NN's were a joke until a CNN won an image recognition contest in 2012, which is what put them on the map.  Before that they were obscure and overlooked.  
I'm not sure why you believe this.  Neural networks have been a big deal since the 1950s, taking down investments of half a billion at a time from the military for 70+ years now.  
NNs have definitely had a ton of research, so I agree that they weren't overlooked. However, up until 2012 they weren't very useful for most applications. Throughout the 2000s, SVMs and tree-based models (like random forests) were SOTA for most tasks. So most researchers put their focus there.  2012 marked a transition though, as we then had the hardware support to efficiently train much larger models. This allowed NNs to become SOTA in many tasks and thus the explosion in interest

A friend of mine recently adapted this model for Skype, Zoom, etc. Very easy to install. http://github.com/alievk/avatarify  
I've been showing up to all of my online classes as Obama for a week now with this. Great stuff! It's a bit laggy because my graphics card is a little bit old (GTX 1070), but it's really not that bad, although certainly not as smooth as in the video  
A 6GB 1070GTX can't handle this decently? Damn...

Sorry for the noob question, but what does "first order" mean here?  
First order Taylor expansion  
What does First order Taylor expansion mean?  
The transformation between two images (for instance, from a video of a moving face) is typically encoded by a dense motion field (or optical flow) which means each pixel has an associated motion which can be quite intricate. In this paper, such a transformation is approximated by taking multiple points of interest in the image and for each point, estimating the Taylor series expansion of that particular sub-transformation while observing the transformation's effect in a small neighborhood, which is much easier than trying to estimate the dense motion model. This Taylor series only has the first order derivative term, neglecting higher order terms for simplicity.

how do you do this? like what program? its cool  
The authors have a colab notebook on the github repo for this project. It pretty much walks you through the process and lets you try your own. Pretty fun. Just open the demo.ipynb file, it gives you an option to open in colab.  
how do you do this? like what program? its cool  
Adobe Character Animator will get you these results.  
Doesn't character animator require you to define correspondences to different key mouth positions?   This is much faster when it works. Nothing to configure.  Also, I thought that was 2D. This is doing some 3D perspective warping when you turn your head etc.

 You get the code from their GitHub and run it on your machine which has Nvidia gpu preferably You use Google colab https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model/blob/master/demo.ipynb Using this file to run it on Google's server.

I went to a museum where they had iPads in frames and actors playing parts to tell the story. When the program started and they went from still to moving and taking my 3 year old flipped out. Terrified. His brain could not handle that. I had to leave. It was pretty funny.  But I like the idea of deep faking an actor onto a historical photo or painting and having them tell the story. Could make the experience more engaging. Just, you know, for slightly older kids. 😬

Alan Turing  
Alan Turing  
An incredible man with an unnecessarily tragic story. He was robbed of his dignity and never got any recognition while he lived. I hope he will be honored through the ages for what he's accomplished and enabled, and for the lives he saved by putting his genius to good use.  
Just to expand on this briefly, for those who don't know... Alan Turing is, in many ways, the founder of modern computer science. So much of the technology we enjoy today is built upon his contributions to the field. Turing was a major contributor to the creation of the famous "Enigma" machine which was used to programmatically break the Nazi's encoded messages during World War II. It is estimated by some that Turing's work on Enigma shortened the duration of the war by years and saved millions of lives. After the war ended, it was discovered that Turing was homosexual, which (at that time) was a crime in Britain. Turing was prosecuted for this and consequently, was chemically castrated by the government (I'm not sure if the castration was part of his sentencing or a plea bargain — look it up yourself if that detail is important to you.) Shortly after this, Turing was found dead. Many believe that he committed suicide, although I believe this is still a matter of debate. It wasn't until 2013 that the British government posthumously pardoned Turing.

Much respect for Alan Turing. And much sadness😔  
I'd say mostly disappoinment and rage that other humans did this to him. We can always do better and it starts with love

[D] This AI reveals how much time politicians stare at their phone at work
Voting takes forever. What exactly are they "supposed" to be doing during a time when they're not allowed to talk to their neighbors? This is just "look busy" toxic work culture lol  
Wait, do they vote one by one? Sounds inefficient. Here everybody has three buttons in their chairs, they push it and the result appears in a screen. Done in less than a minute. The exception is really important votes, they do vote aloud then. This does nothing to stop them from staring at their phones tho.  
FYI this appears to be a panel of Belgian ministers, not any kind of legislative body.  Still not sure what is wrong with politicians looking at their phones instead of sitting idly, there's probably a good chance what they're doing is work-related.  
I believe that the root reason for having a parliament is to discuss, and to discuss you need to focus on who's speaking.

You work on a laptop! It's almost imposable to work on a phone, there at best on twitter. You just need to cross check there social media accounts to the time on there phone to see if there posting cat photos online. edit, now I think about it you may be able to tell what there doing up to a point from how they handle the phone, finger/hand movement will give a good impression of what kind of task they are doing. Text will always have keyboard at bottom of display, reading will have long swipes up/down & more random movements will be games?  
That's an ignorant observation. They are politicians, don't you think they may need to text or send a quick email to people?  Regardless, phones are a massive part of most any blue collar job that involves communicating with people. Also, "almost impossible to work on a phone" is a short sighted opinion.

I wholeheartedly disagree and work on my iPhone all of the time. I hate reading dense text on a laptop. It’s much better on an iPhone. An iPad is great too, but less portable. I highly doubt it, but they could literally be reading a bill or annotating it. As a software engineer, I think there is very little that can’t be done on a phone or tablet these days. Unfortunately, developing software remains one of those things, but most jobs don’t even need a computer anymore. Hence, apples “what’s a computer?” iPad commercials.

I'm a sysadmin and can do my job 100% on my phone if needed. It's maybe not the most efficient but it can be done.

Tradition + transparency + accuracy + accountability.  
Tradition I grant you, but the accuracy, transparency, and accountability parts is BS. It'd be easy to display the individual vote on a dashboard, on a public website, and if you want, clear Yea/Nay indicator right next to their face. Hell give them 5 minutes between pushing a button and vote lock in, if you care to.

￼ Digital Culture Artificial Intelligence AI bot trolls politicians with how much time they're looking at phones "pls stay focused!" By  Alison Foreman  on July 5, 2021  > Life > Digital Culture Sure, we've all snuck a look at our phones in dull meetings. But if you're working on the taxpayer's dime, you'd better be ready for artificial intelligence to call you out for gawping at the black mirror in the legislature when you should be, you know, legislating. That's what digital artist Dries Depoorter did for his latest installation "The Flemish Scrollers." His software that uses facial recognition to automatically call out politicians in the Flemish province of Belgium who are distracted by their phones when its parliament is in session. The project comes almost two years after Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon caused public outrage after playing Angry Birds during a policy discussion. (Really.) Launched Monday, Depoorter's system monitors daily livestreams of government meetings on YouTube to assess how long a representative has been looking at their phone versus the meeting in progress. If the AI detects a distracted person, it will publicly identify the party by posting the clip — on Instagram @TheFlemishScrollers, and Twitter @FlemishScroller.  
[D] This AI reveals how much time politicians stare at their phone at work
 Every meeting of the flemish government in Belgium is live streamed on a youtube channel. When a livestream starts the software is searching for phones and tries to identify a distracted politician. This is done with the help of AI and face recognition. The video of the distracted politician are then posted to a Twitter and Instagram account with the politician tagge  So, this tries to identify 'distracted' politicians, but only includes phones and excludes staring at laptops and tablets - for some reason? Is there a reason? All I see is a system that detects whether some politician is using their phone or not. Disregarding my (negative) biases towards politicians, this honestly says nothing of whether they're distracted or doing productive/non-productive work on their phones/tablets/laptops.

The context is important here. In 2019, a Flemish minister got caught playing angry birds on his phone. With this in mind, it is particularly funny to look at the politicians phone usage.  
Person relaxes for a few minutes at work, more news at nine! I really hate this praise of micromanagement of politicians, especially from people who otherwise hate micromanagement.

Great example of bias in ai and ml. Well said.  
Why or how is this a great example of bias in computer vision?  
Not in the computer vision, but rather in the interpretation of the results We see people looking at laptops and phones, so we assume they're slacking, when there's no reason to believe that's not working

I guess the assunption is you use the bigger screens for serious work and private phones (are they private?) for idle fun?  
Indeed, it's impossible to send a tweet to your electorate about the vote. Phones only come with Candy Crush these days.

[D] This AI reveals how much time politicians stare at their phone at work
All this shows is that you can successfully detect a phone and maybe a politician in the picture.  It doesnt say anything about "how much time" or even about whether them staring at the phone is equivalent to them being productive or unproductive.  Also, this looks like a simple object detection algorithm. It is not AI. It is a computer vision algorithm.  It is time we start using the right terminology, be accurate in our descriptions of what the work is about and lastly, stop overestimating our work.  
Object detection is a form of AI, how else do you think it is able to classify each bounding box in the picture? It has learned this through examples which resembles human learning. Maybe don’t try to lecture people if you clearly don’t even work in the field  
I don't think convolutions or backpropagation resemble human learning in any shape, way, or form, but maybe that's just me.  
I don’t want to start the discussion about biological plausibility of deep nets here, because it is redundant to the discussion of the system being an AI. The functional concept is what determines if a system can be considered an AI, not so much the technical implementation. AI in the field is seen as mimicking some sort of smart human behavior which leaves no doubt when the system is ‘learning from examples’. I do understand however that the umbrella term has a vague boundary (back in the days even simple knowledge system were seen as AI), but object detection is far away from this boundary as it resembles complex human behavior  
I don't think convolutions or backpropagation resemble human learning in any shape, way, or form, but maybe that's just me.  
It takes great strawman-making skill to see convolutions or backpropagation in  It has learned this through examples  ...but if you insist on being pedantic, backpropagation does resemble human learning in the broadest way, as it involves changing internal information processing routines after obtaining information about past mistakes.

I would argue that object recognition is a large part of what “AI” colloquially means right now. If we are being prescriptivist, fine, but it’s too subtle or a distinction for the masses.  
It is a reason for confusion. Because of this misrepresentation notions like, "AI will take over the world" , "AI will be the reason we lose our jobs", "AI is biased" arise.  Being accurate and being willing to explain these distinctions to the masses doesnt make me a prescriptivist.

It is time we start using the right terminology, be accurate in our descriptions of what the work is about and lastly, stop overestimating our work.  
How do you know it's not using multilayer perceptrons? Ai is one way to do object recognition, but you're right that it's not the only way.  
(When you're a practitioner for a very long time, you know what was used, how something was done just by looking at the output. )  But for the benefit of your understanding and for others reading, Id take your question as an opportunity to explain this point further.  Firstly, nothing in my comment suggested that I thought they were or were not using "multilayer perceptrons" , even if they were using neural networks or deep learning it would still come under the area of computer vision and not AI. So your rather emphatic focus on MLP (multilayer perceptrons) doesnt mean anything specifically or validate the stand you are trying to take as to why this should be under AI vs computer vision.   AI is an umbrella term that could mean anything. Usually it is used when you have been able to port a supreme level of intelligence into your software or product through a combination of various tasks within various subfields of AI. AI combines areas like Classical Machine Learning, Natural language processing, Computer vision etc, which again can be broken down into tasks like classification, regression  (classical ML), question answering systems, text summarization, named entity recognition (in the case of NLP) and object detection/localization, object recognition, facial recognition, scene recognition (in the case of CV) .  The reason AI does very little to actually inform readers about what is happening is because it could mean anything right from a heuristic based system to deep learning and it also doesnt give a clear idea of the kind of data that was used to generate a result. The way to describe work in the field is to mention the particular tasks used to achieve an objective , like object detection, facial recognition in this case. Instead of saying AI.  For additional reference, please take a look at this collection of papers and how they describe the various tasks :  https://paperswithcode.com/sota A very common misrepresentation is when people use Machine learning and AI interchangeably. Machine learning is a subset of AI and isnt equivalent to AI.  Now, riddle me this, does netflix use AI? Or recommender systems?  
love your comment. but you are fighting a fight you cant win. everything is AI nowadays as long ad it involved a NN. thats the power of the buzz word

AI just seems like a silly marketing term. We have not even defined intelligence properly, how can we define artificial intelligence then? Machine learning sounds more intuitive to me since we usually try to model a probability distribution in the best way we can. The machine literally learns the distribution in a defined model.

It is time we start using the right terminology, be accurate in our descriptions of what the work is about and lastly, stop overestimating our work.  
computer vision is a branch of AI though. but the rest is true, it can maybe detect humans sitting (not just politicians) and hands + rectangle-shaped objects, but hardly anything more. I would be more interested in developing an eye-tracking model for the politicians' eyesight, which I think would be much more informative as to what is actually happening in their minds. At least, it would prove that they focus on the bottom of their female colleagues much more than they care to admit, which would be a good point to start a discussion on how to replace them with recommender systems for public policies.  
Computer vision is overlapping with AI but it is not a "branch  of" AI. There are entire vision tasks that involve only geometry.

It is time we start using the right terminology, be accurate in our descriptions of what the work is about and lastly, stop overestimating our work.

Staring at phone may not always be unproductive if that is what being implied by this study. Lot of useful work is being done using phones now a days.  
If I were a politician and trying to be especially keen during a session, I would be fact checking every single thing, and I would be doing it on my phone.

Can't say I agree. Thought you were going to go in an actually useful direction with your post. I give you a 6/10 for effort. Here's where you should've gone with it:  Staring at phone may not always be unproductive if that is what being implied by this study. Consider the damage these politicians would be doing if they weren't distracted by their little glass teats. For them, truly, doing nothing is more productive than the alternative. Ever heard the expression less is more? Well it's back and this is the Hollywood sequel.

So probalistic facial recognition and smartphone utilization? How do you, or the viewer, know that they're not working?  
I think it's not facial recognition, because the seats are allocated to politicians on a permanent basis and the cameras are likely to have a static position and orientation. therefore it is sufficient to determine if a human is present where they are expected to be, to know that politician X is sitting on that chair

These are politicians.  I dont care one bit about them. nor do I feel bad or sorry for them. I care about the actual people though, and I dont think that level of McCarthyism should be allowed at work. I also dont think its legal with the current framework.

People are way too focused on the why and not enough on the what. Who cares that it's not a perfect representation of how distracted they are? Who cares if they're doing actual work or not on their phone? This is not about that, this is about an AI that can determine whether you're on your phone or not. That's it! Why everything needs to be political?

 Everyone trying to squeeze out final drops from our poor cow.  To be fair, in many applications the last drops are the most important. An algorithm with a 99.8% accuracy sure sounds really good and seems like it would be useless to improve, until you realize it's for a self-driving system and the alternative with 99.9% has twice the survival rate for it's users... That 0.1% reduction in the error rate, I'd consider a 100% improvement.  
Except, since we're suffering a reproducibility crisis, that 0.1% might not mean all that much  
Every paper should come with code. It might feel embarrassing if the code is messy but we all have our flaws. Also: please for the love of god use already known theorems, like all the classical stochastics. We have proven optimal solutions for some topics. Bake them into your nets.

"We rediscovered something known 30 years ago and we didn't cite it"  
Which, when, true (that it was a rediscovery and they hadn't been aware of the prior work) isn't even necessarily the researcher's fault. That's more on the hands of the reviewers. Different sub-field use different terminology. It's so easy to miss something when hundreds of papers are put on arxiv every single day.  
I’ve seen a similar thing recently with patenting. There’s something like 2k patents submitted to the USPTO every day, and with just over 10k employees I really doubt they have time to do a proper prior art check. In patenting though, there’s are mechanisms to reverse / alter patents after the fact. In publishing, once the paper’s out and has seen enough citations, there no incentive to make any corrections.

PhDs require 10 publications!?  
Ehh it varies from field to field and university to university. I'm being hyperbolic here, but honestly not by much. My advisor wanted me to publish at least one conference and one journal paper for the 3 years of my PhD, which could have easily ballooned to 5 years. Instead I got a job at a startup and never looked back.  
you dropped out? If so, do you plan on ever finishing?

This is science in general, better than that, it's how exact sciences progress, measurable, reproducible improvement, even if extremely small, each person makes a miniscule dent in the bubble of human knowledge, not sure why people are expecting different stuff from the ML field

In my experience science doesn't progress by lots of people making miniscule improvements. It mostly progresses by a few people occasionally making big improvements.

Hahahaha.  Bottom left corner is why I left ML reasearch. What was ridiculous was CVPR actually accepting the <1% improvements.  
May I ask which point you directed towards after leaving?  
The insignificance. How does improving 1% help at all? Figured I'd build ML products that help people directly. My research lab would clobber up novel ways that don't make sense just to appear novel.

The insignificance. How does improving 1% help at all? Figured I'd build ML products that help people directly. My research lab would clobber up novel ways that don't make sense just to appear novel.  
It's the longstanding downside to "publish or perish". Find the best seed, make unreproducible claims, and compare it to the worst baseline model. There is so much pressure to show positive results there is a huge publication bias type problem in the industry. Hell, a decade ago we just added more research participants until we got statistical significance, then threw those numbers into our paper and send it off. "Do the results mean anything though?" earns you a slap on the wrist

I'm sure there's more to that, but 1% improvement when the best model is already at 97%, in some industries can be the difference between applicable and not applicable, the difference between "Hey that's neat!" to "We can use that!". And that's not even talking about the iterative nature of improvement, you're disillusioned with the scientific process as a whole it seems

There are always exceptions of course, transformers did. GANs, LSTM..  
The transformer paper was an important step, but it's still a natural one given the preceding work on attention. LSTMs feel similar, but it's hard to comment now on the research landscape in the early days of Rnns. GANs also didn't happen in a vacuum,  VAEs were already around and share some structure. Of course all of these are still important papers, my point is that there was a sequence of work building up to each of these.

Always use latex.most conferences and publishers have templates to work with that will let it look excactly like real papers. Word of advise, most universities have their own templates (the one I use in teaching is based of ACMs)  
Depends on your field. I worked in neuroimaging with ML, and the top journals didn't use LaTeX unfortunately. My lab / PI used Microsoft Word .... Much to the chagrin of our mathematician.  
Good lord, at that point I'd tex up the math and send over pngs

I personally love Mendeley for reference tracking. It can integrate with Overleaf to generate your bibtex file automatically, and it has a browser extension so you can save citations on the spot when you're on a web page or reading a paper.  
i wrote my undergrad thesis in latex using overleaf + Mendeley with near zero prior experience with latex and it was an absolute breeze. Figures, section references and citations are so much easier than Word. I'm absolutely never going back

You're going to get a lot of advice to use LaTeX, and if your paper as a lot of equations it might be useful, but otherwise I would check with your supervisors/lab before going down that road. Word can be a pain sometimes, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be, and you need something that others can read and contribute to. I wrote a lot of my PhD work in LaTeX, and while I liked it for my thesis, is was really too much work for papers that I did with others.

I see a lot of comments talking about all the short comings of ML. How there are too many people in the field, how there are not enough, too many graduate students, requirements are to strick or too lenient.  As someone who is about to enter grad school, in ML, and who is committed to the idea of being apart of this apperant broken machine. How can I be apart of the change that results in something better? Sure, read more papers, be better at research, be more creative, blah blah blah, descriptors that are easy for the experienced to understand and impossible for the young and learning to interpret.  The reason that science seems to be only nudged by the many and truly pushed by the few is because, in my opinion, success is hardly documented and faults and critism are plentiful. I think if more were willing to mentor, teach and share then we could see more progress. I know I could be better. Finally, we need a less hand wavy approach to learning how to research. The best I have learned about and getting a mentor, hoping he/she will take you under their wing and emulate as much as possible. Research shouldn't require a parent. I don't have a better solution unfortunately but i wish there was one.

i hate the ones that begin with "towards..". why the tf would i want to read something that's incomplete?  
When you're wandering in the dark, any sense of direction is welcome.  
i prefer to consider taking direction from someone who has confidence they know the way.  
"Towards" means there's evidence that this approach holds promise.  It doesn't mean that's the answer or the end-all-be-all.  You don't get papers like that very often in any kind of science.  With something as challenging as AGI, for example, anyone that says they know with confidence where the answer is is either lying, mistaken, or using a definition that's off the mark. "Towards a unified theory of gravitation" might be "incomplete", as you said, but that's like saying, "You only have one Michelin Star?" Or, "You only have one Nobel prize?" It's technically accurate, but feels rather pejorative to me. It's probably obvious that I'm salty, and maybe I'm taking too personally something that was offered in jest, but I hope the grievance about the use of "incomplete" isn't entirely lost.

That is cool. However, procrastinating is a great thing to do. Most of my favorite papers and projects I've worked on come from me getting up from my desk and walking around the department looking for people to have coffee and random discussions so I don't have to work. So while maybe studying is important not to procrastinate, I have never found it detrimental in the long run.

It always depends on the type and amount of procrastination. For some people, procrastination means doing something that’s more fun than their main task, but it’s still kind of productive and actually fun. For others, it means relieving pressure from work by doing something more mundane that gives you immediate gratification, like browsing Reddit. And that can be in total mind numbing and unproductive.

Most of my favorite papers and projects I've worked on come from me getting up from my desk and walking around the department looking for people to have coffee and random discussions so I don't have to work. So while maybe studying is important not to procrastinate, I have never found it detrimental in the long run.

Does anyone know how is the network detecting multiple objects at once? Can a network have variable output sizes for detecting more than one object?  
You can easily build one by fine-tuning YOLO. You can read up on this, but the way these algorithms work is by guessing a bunch of bounding boxes and predicting class probabilities for each one. It's actually very straightforward to build object detectors--all you have to do is label a few images (you can even use an online image labelling software). Check out https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 for more details--given labelled data, you can probably get a model working in under 30 minutes.

Studying is a massive waste of time. It is glorifying the special human characteristic of being terrible at retaining information. The simple solution would be to manufacture a memory retention system within your brain that didn’t totally suck and didn’t require you to study in the first place. Should be able to simply copy the information into your head.

 Thirdly, there is a worshiping problem.  Thank you. I was going to make a meta-post on this topic, suggesting that the subreddit put a temporary moratorium on threads discussing individual personalities instead of their work—obvious exceptions for huge awards or deaths. We need to step back for a moment and consider whether the worship culture is healthy, especially when some of these people perpetuate the toxicity you're writing about above.  
100% agreed. It irks me when really interesting research by less well-known researchers that can spark great discussion is posted on this sub and there are only 1-2 comments discussing it while at the same time a post about a random tweet by an ML celebrity garners 300-500 comments.  
Part of this has to do with the growth of the sub. A few years back a much greater proportion of participants were ML specialists who knew how to identify good research in their field regardless of how well known the authors are. ML hype over time has resulted in this sub being overrun by AI celebrity gossip and news about Siraj Raval. Don't get me wrong, ML deserves a lot of the hype it's been getting, but that energy would be better spent developing new models and creating better datasets as opposed to the social media bullshit that's taken over ML's public perception today.

 It used to be that science was embedded inside Western liberalism ideals of "nothing is absolutely correct everything is possible", but in recent times it has increasingly become binary, concentrated on "if you're not right you're wrong". Applies not just to science but many other things.  There is no "used to be". These are problems that have always existed across all fields. It is human psychology. We only perceive that those problems didn't exist in the past because of various biases.

I don't deny that there is a worshipping problem, but I'd like to offer yet another hypothesis for why papers from Google/DeepMind/etc are getting more attention: Trust. With such a huge number of papers every week, it's impossible to read them all. Using pedigree is one way to filter, and while it's biased and unfair, it's not a bad one. Researchers at DeepMind are not any more talented than elsewhere, but they take on more risk. When DeepMind publishes a paper, it stakes its reputations on its validity. If the results turned out to be a fluke it would reflect badly on the whole company, leading to bad press and a loss of reputation. Thus it's likely that papers from these organizations go through a stricter "quality control" process and internal peer review before they get published. I am guilty of this myself. I regularly read through the titles of new arXiv submissions. When I see something interesting, I look at the authors. If it's DeepMind/Google/OpenAI/etc I take a closer look. If it's a group of authors from a place I've never heard off, I stop reading. Why? Because in my mind, the latter group of authors is more likely to "make up stuff" and have their mistakes go unnoticed because they didn't go through the same internal quality control that a DeepMind paper would. There's a higher probability that I'm reading something that's just wrong. This has nothing to do with me worshipping DeepMind, I just trust its papers more due to the way the system works. Is what I'm doing wrong? Yes, it clearly is. I shouldn't look at the authors at all. It should be about the content. But there are just too many papers and I don't want to risk wasting my time.

We actually wrote a paper regarding some of the above points. Kind of a self-criticism: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07633 Some other points we touched: "lack of hypothesis" & "chronic allergy to negative results"  And we discussed (without claiming always applicable) the possibility of results-blind peer review process.  
 chronic allergy to negative results  As someone who just finished a graduation thesis this month about a noise-attenuation neural network (autoencoder) applied to microcontrollers... My results couldn't have been more negative, quite literally, and yet I am still presenting it based on the fact that it is also worthwhile to publish negative results, fully knowing it won't have that much appreciation. And yet, to my surprise, my negative results were celebrated by the council. I am very confident of the value my work brings to the world yet I just had this idea that people supposed to evaluate my work would just not get it when I told them that I exhausted every possibility of trying to make something work and yet it didn't and all I have to prove is "don't do what I tried because it doesn't work no matter the configuration".  Universities and professors should dedicate more time to let students and future PhDs know that proving something doesn't work is just as important to the world as the opposite. Thankfully I think this is becoming more self-evident as time progresses.

Negative result is also a result, that's what my professors encouraged too.  And i think, at Springer joirnals or somewhere else, to counter this "allergy" they introduced the format of "research report". Which is essentially "we tried this, here's the outcome". So both positive and negative results should be equal, because you do not report on the "new effect discovered", you just report on input-methods-output. I really hope this becomes a more prevalent format for scientific publications.

Some of these are rampant in academia in general, what hasn't happened elsewhere is the spotlight (and $$$) that has been thrown at CS/ML in past few years.  We see what fame/fortune does to a lot of people (outside academia) we are not immune to the lesser parts of human behavior.  
 we are not immune to the lesser parts of human behavior  Ironically, this arrogance feels like one of ML's biggest problems.  Some of these are rampant in academia in general, what hasn't happened elsewhere is the spotlight (and $$$) that has been thrown at CS/ML in past few years. We see what fame/fortune does to a lot of people (outside academia) we are not immune to the lesser parts of human behavior.  Just posted some data on some of the problems in academia: Graphs of parental incomes of Harvard's student body: http://harvardmagazine.com/2017/01/low-income-students-harvard https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/harvard-university Who benefits from discriminatory college admissions policies? the advantage of having a well-connected relative. At the University of Texas at Austin, an investigation found that recommendations from state legislators and other influential people helped underqualified students gain acceptance to the school. This is the same school that had to defend its affirmative action program for racial minorities before the U.S. Supreme Court. And those de facto advantages run deep. Beyond legacy and connections, consider good old money. “The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges — and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates,” by Daniel Golden, details how the son of former Sen. Bill Frist was accepted at Princeton after his family donated millions of dollars. Businessman Robert Bass gave $25 million to Stanford University, which then accepted his daughter. And Jared Kushner’s father pledged $2.5 million to Harvard University, which then accepted the student who would become Trump’s son-in-law and advisor. Selective colleges’ hunger for athletes also benefits white applicants above other groups. Those include students whose sports are crew, fencing, squash and sailing, sports that aren’t offered at public high schools. The thousands of dollars in private training is far beyond the reach of the working class. And once admitted, they generally under-perform, getting lower grades than other students, according to a 2016 report titled “True Merit” by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. “Moreover,” the report says, “the popular notion that recruited athletes tend to come from minority and indigent families turns out to be just false; at least among the highly selective institutions, the vast bulk of recruited athletes are in sports that are rarely available to low-income, particularly urban schools.” Any investigation should be ready to find that white students are not the most put-upon group when it comes to race-based admissions policies. That title probably belongs to Asian American students who, because so many of them are stellar achievers academically, have often had to jump through higher hoops than any other students in order to gain admission. Here's another group, less well known, that has benefited from preferential admission policies: men. There are more qualified college applications from women, who generally get higher grades and account for more than 70% of the valedictorians nationwide. Seeking to create some level of gender balance, many colleges accept a higher percentage of the applications they receive from males than from females. http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-affirmative-action-investigation-trump-20170802-story.html "Meritocracy": White Americans' anti-affirmative action opinions dramatically change  when shown that Asian-American students would qualify more in  admissions because of their better test scores and fewer white students  would get in for just being white. At that point, when they believe whites will benefit from  affirmative action compared to Asian-Americans, white Americans say that  using race and affirmative action should be a factor and is fair and the right thing to do:  Indeed, the degree to which white people emphasized merit for college  admissions changed depending on the racial minority group, and whether  they believed test scores alone would still give them an upper hand  against a particular racial minority.As a result, the study suggests that the emphasis on merit has less  to do with people of color's abilities and more to do with how white  people strategically manage threats to their position of power from  nonwhite groups. http://www.vox.com/2016/5/22/11704756/affirmative-action-merit  Also, Asians are somehow treated as more privileged than white Americans:  white applicants were three times more likely to be admitted to selective schools than Asian applicants with the exact same academic record. Additionally, affirmative action will not do away with legacy admissions that are more likely available to white applicants.  "Legacy admissions": The majority of Asian-Americans grow up with first-generation  immigrant parents whose English (and wealth) don't give them the same  advantages as "privileged," let alone what's called "legacy" Stanford's acceptance rate is 5.1% … if either of your parents went to Stanford, this triples for you In any other circumstance, this would be considered bribery. But when rich alumni do it, it’s allowed. In fact, it’s tax-subsidized. Worse, this “affirmative action for the rich” is paid for by everyone else. As non-profits, these elite universities – and their enormous, hedge fund-esque endowments – are mostly untaxed. Both private and public universities that use legacy admissions are additionally subsidized through student aid programs, research grants, and other sources of federal and state money. In addition, as Elizabeth Stoker and Matt Bruenig explain, alumni donations to these schools are also not taxed and therefore subsidized by the general population. They write, “The vast majority of parents do not benefit from the donation-legacy system. Yet these parents are forced, through the tax code, to help fund alumni donations against their own children’s chances of admission to the elite institutions they may otherwise be well qualified for.” If legacy preference “shows a respect for tradition,” as supporters of the practice argue, that tradition is inherited aristocracy and undeserved gains. It is fundamentally against the notion of universities as “great equalizers.” It promotes those who already have wealth and power and diminishes those who do not. It subsidizes the wealthy to line the coffers of the richest universities. In other words – elite education is predominantly for the rich. And because these institutions disproportionately serve as feeders for positions of wealth, power, and influence, they perpetuate existing social and income disparities. Yet these schools ardently try to claim that they are instead tools for social mobility and equalization. You cannot have your cake, eat it too, and then accept its cupcakes through legacy admissions. Children of alumni already have an incredible built-in advantage merely by being the children of college graduates from elite universities. They are much more likely to grow up wealthy, get a good education, and have access to the resources and networks at the top of the social, economic, and political ladders. Legacy admission thus gives them an added advantage on top of all of this, rewarding those who already have a leg up at the expense of those who do not have the same backgrounds. William Bowen, Martin Kurzweil, and Eugene Tobin put it more succinctly: “Legacy preferences serve to reproduce the high-income/high-education/white profile that is characteristic of these schools.” Right now we have the worst of both worlds. We have a profoundly unfair system masquerading as a meritocracy. If we are going to continue to subsidize elite schools and allow them to have the outsize impact that they currently do on our national economic, political, and social institutions, we need to start to chip away at the fundamental imbalances in the system. Step one: Get rid of legacy preference in admissions. https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshfreedman/2013/11/14/the-farce-of-meritocracy-in-elite-higher-education-why-legacy-admissions-might-be-a-good-thing/, https://blog.collegevine.com/legacy-demystified-how-the-people-you-know-affect-your-admissions-decision/, https://twitter.com/xc/status/892861426074664960

This is common in academia. Still worth criticisizing if it makes any difference.  
I agree it's common but it definitely shouldn't be the norm. It's probably a large reason why PhD students are so stressed during those 4 years.  
Are data scientists or software devs less stressed? Going by rate of online complaints, it seems similar. They say it's always tight deployment deadlines, technical debt, clueless non-technical managers, overtime culture, everything is always on fire etc. They look at academic research as a heaven where you set flexible hours, can spend a week diving in a math textbook or a new topic, you work on your own research project and ideas, your manager is a professor in your field not some MBA, etc. etc. I'm saying this as a stressed PhD student, but I think people are biased to imagine the grass is so green on the other side. Competition in general creates stress, and you have competition in corporate industry careers as much as in academic research.  
I am sure these issues exist everywhere. But it seems in industry at least you come right out as being motivated to churn out more sales or profits, being the power hungry leader, so on and so forth whereas in academia you put yourself on a high pedestal as to being morally superior because of your work for the "greater good" (despite holding grudges for your competitors, power-plays against your competitors in "blind"-reviews, possessing the same qualities as managers in industry). Let's all be honest and accept presence of toxic people in all walks of life.

 Thirdly, there is a worshiping problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper.  I totally agree with the premise... but, I think a lot of people forget just how easy it was to load up BERT and take it for a spin. The effort the authors put into the usability of the model helped immensely.

TLDR; politics sucks. Unfortunately, you can never escape politics, no matter which field you escape to. I started doing scientific research because I imagined the system to be a fair meritocracy. It's science after all. If you don't like politics, academia is one of the worst places to be. This is the sad truth. This is not a recent phenomenon, and it's not just ML. It has always been this way. It's just more visible now because more people are new to the field and surprised that it's not what they expected. As long as the academic system functions the way it does and is protected by gatekeepers and institutions with perverse incentives, this will never change. What can you do? Lead by example. Don't play the game and exit the system. Do independent research. Do something else. Don't be driven by your ego that tells you to compete with other academics and publish more papers. Do real stuff. It's very difficult to reform a system from within. Reform comes when enough people decide to completely exit a system and build an alternative that has a critical mass.  
YES, a thousand times YES. The current situation is a bad one and you can hardly expect to solve real problems with the research process of today. I forcefully went independent after my PhD lost funding. I completely burned out and with all sorts of psychological damage -- maybe the best thing that happened to me because it got me out of hell. I can research real problems now not being pressured just to write papers, albeit it's harder without any community. Not that I had an active advisor or other staff to help. Another thing I have a problem understanding is why such intelligent people tolerate this bullshit. It would be very easy to reform the entire research process with the skills and knowledge this community has.

Wow, this post is making me seriously rethink applying for an ML graduate program.  
There are a lot of very closely related fields that are a lot less competitive. Indeed in my department I think anyone would be way better off not being in one of the big ML groups, and working under another advisor with a smaller group (not too small though because that means the prof is hard to work with or doesn’t have enough money). My impression is that these giant groups are miserable to work in, highly competitive even within a competitive grad program, and run by senior grad students or post docs so you won’t even get to work with the “famous” prof, it’s just a nice line on your resume. But many advisors not in ML would be happy for their students to apply ML to their research, so there is really no need to be in one of those groups unless you feel it is really important to you. You should try to find an advisor that is willing to let you explore your interests, easy to work with, and has the time and money to support you. When you do campus visits, the most important thing is asking students in different groups how happy they are with their advisor.  TL;DR don’t choose a famous ML advisor/at least know what you’re getting into. But work on ML anyway if it interests you.  
When you say closely related do you mean an ML subset like CV, NLP, or do you mean something like Electrical Engineering or Statstics which can have heavily overlapping subject matter depending on the area of interest?  
 Electrical Engineering or Statistics  lol, the best theoretical ML research comes out of these departments

Yes this is just crazy how hard the ML community manages to clash and tear itself apart regularly.  I follow both the physics community and the ML community and it’s quite hard to imagine physicists trash talking this hard and politicizing every aspect of their research. Ok ML has social influences but this is just ridiculous to see people pushing their political beliefs through their research ... Concerning reproducibility and the race to publish I think it’s simply because ML is extremely competitive with regard to other fields (physics for example).  
Which part of the physics community? It's just less publicized there.  
Probably the parts that has to do with big collaborations. I'm currently on one of those, and there's a heavy incentive to not misbehave since no one would work with you otherwise, and that's almost always a death sentence since you'll never not need help working on a big collaboration. I have seen those behaviors from smaller labs and more independent researchers though. Thankfully the field is moving on the right track as older professors retire, for some reasons.  
I'm also on a big collaboration and there is drama/politics of course, it just doesn't happen in public/on twitter. But leadership often does try to keep everyone happy (even to the slight detriment of the science sometimes).

Not sure I entirely agree re physics. Physicists are opinionated as much as anyone & go pretty hard. Just browse Sabine Hossenfelder's blog as an example. Same with mathematicians, logicians, philosophers, etc. Doesn't really make sense to compare fields like this imo.  
Sabine is a suuuuuuper edge case though, she has strong opinions about everything and will always fight people for it. It's probably more helpful to look at the average phycisist, although I have no idea how you would even go about that other than anecdotal evidence. But overall I'd say the field is less politicized and more concerned with petty drama, if only for the fact that the majority of physics is detached from most of real life.

Albert Einstein was absolutely not opposed to quantum mechanics, by any stretch of the imagination. Saying Einstein was opposed to QM is like saying Alan Turing was against computers; Einstein was one of the founding fathers of QM. What Einstein took issue with, was the Copenhagen interpretation of QM.  Many/most physicist working in foundational QM today share his view on that.

This. I also read that Schrödinger too was against the idea that an electron can be in more than one state, probablistically at a time. He proposed his hypothetical cat experiment to prove the absurdity in the Copenhagen interpretation. Ironically, it is used today to explain the probabilistic nature in QM. I might be wrong. Read that sometime back.

 papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection.  Wait, can someone provide an example of this?  
[deleted]  
Well, for both this and /u/manganime1's question, you can take a look at http://horace.io/OpenReviewExplorer/ There were 9 papers at ICLR rejected with a (6,6,8):  such as https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJlDDnVKwS, https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxJO3VFwB, https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxeThNFPH Some papers that were accepted with extremely low scores:  (1,3,3): https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg76kStwH (6,1,3): https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1emfT4twB  
The rationale for the acceptance of these papers with low score was the response of the authors and the lack of further response from the reviewers. The Area Chair considered the authors' responses satisfactory and that the reviewers would increase their rating if they were to read those responses. Moreover, none of these were from Google, DeepMind, Facebook, Stanford or other mentioned institutions. I recommend that people check out the reviews of these rejected papers and arrive at their own conclusions, but from what I read the Area Chair decisions seemed reasonable.

Back in 2017, NIPS rejected a quite novel approach to language modeling that I had implemented and found quite effective. (Not my paper.) NIPS accepted essentially every NLP paper that came out of FAIR or DeepMind, even those that claimed only trivial improvements that were attributable to grid search, and those that were obviously grossly exaggerating their accomplishments.  Reading the reviewer comments, I couldn’t help shaking the feeling that what was going on, was that the anonymous reviewers worked for the same companies and were just helping out their buddies.  That was one of the events that led me to get out of NLP AI research.

 If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a loser  No, that's not true. You're only expected to publish 5+ papers every year in your 4th / 5th year Ph.D! Before then, you're only expected to publish 2-3 papers a year, and before Ph.D as undergrad or masters you only need 1-2!  
That's an insane amount of papers...   I want to believe this is sarcasm.  
It is mainly sarcasm, but there is a hint of truth :/ To be competitive as a grad school applicant these days, you almost certainly need to be published in a competitive conference. I know one lab that filters out their applications by number of first-author publications in Neurips / ICML / ICLR. I think that's the most extreme example, but most labs do filter by the number of publications (doesn't have to be first author) and recommendation letters. And for PhD students, the bar for being "good" is 2-3 papers in top tier conferences a year. My experience is only from being an undergrad and PhD student in a competitive academic setting in the US, so these expectations may vary.

Forgive me for being new. But what is this obsession with releasing new papers? Is papers seen as some way to get a salary or something? If you really wanted to do AI research, would it not be better to be payed by a private company?  
Firstly, welcome. Writing papers is not exclusive to academia. To cite an example described here, the original BERT paper was written and published by Google employees. To answer your question directly, historically (or perhaps ideally), writing papers and publishing them has been seen as a way to contribute to a collective body of knowledge, thereby advancing the state of the art. The number of papers published by an author was seen as a proxy measure for their influence on the field. However, over the last few decades (I think? could go back further- I'm only a few decades old myself), research institutions started using that metric to measure professional performance among professors. Employers started using it to measure the bona fides of job applicants. Folks started looking at a private institutions' publishing record as a measure of legitimacy and prestige. And, unsurprisingly, this contaminated the incentive structure. To be clear, this "publish or perish" culture is a known issue in academia more broadly, and is not restricted to our domain.

Thank you very much for that explanation. This kind of "publish or perish" culture seems dangerous. What prevents somebody from writing a fake paper? If the research cannot be reproduced entirely from a 3rd party by the paper, then anyone could publish something that is yet not achieved and take credit?  
Any reputable journal will subject all submissions to a process known as "peer review." An editor reviews the submission, then either rejects it or passes it along to other researchers in the relevant discipline who submit feedback to the editor. The editor then either rejects the paper, sends it back to the author for revision, or accepts it for publication. Part of the process that follows is the reproduction of results by other folks in the industry. Note that this is something that is contentious in our field, as it can be difficult to exactly reproduce results which may rely on some (quasi)stochastic (i.e. random) process, or on highly-specified initial conditions (the hyperparameter tuning mentioned above). However, if nobody can even come close to replicating your results, then there's a problem. This is also true in other fields. Taken together, peer review and reproducibility have historically done a fairly decent job of maintaining a generally acceptable standard of quality in publishing. Don't get me wrong, there are still lots of problems, and not even mentioned here is the paywall issue (paying massive fees for journal subscriptions just to see the research), but on the whole this has been the process, and it's gotten us pretty far.

 Is papers seen as some way to get a salary or something?  This dramatically oversimplifies the issue, but yes. There is a strong correlation between the volume of output rather than quality of output, and this incentives as much publishing as possible.  If you really wanted to do AI research, would it not be better to be payed by a private company?  You'll find that the most notable members of the ML community tend to split their time between academia and the private sector, or they are within academia yet funded by the private sector.  
Thank you for that answer. What is the benefit of staying in academia vs. full time private sector?

I’m really disappointed with how Anandkumar acts on Twitter. For example, she said “you are an idiot” to a high school student young researcher for suggesting that we only teach about neural nets in ML classes.  She deleted the reply but then tweeted out another response, again referring to the original tweet as “idiocy”.  How someone can do things like this and be a director at Nvidia and have 30k followers is beyond me. Edit: Apparently he isn’t a high school student, sorry for the mistake. My point was mainly that public figures shouldn't make personal attacks on young researchers, or anybody for that matter.  To put it another way: imagine if a white male researcher called a young female researcher an idiot on a public forum. Many (including myself) would find that to be unacceptable. Yet Anand seems to have gotten away with it here.

To put it another way: imagine if a white male researcher called a young female researcher an idiot on a public forum. Many (including myself) would find that to be unacceptable. Yet Anand seems to have gotten away with it here.  
I’m really disappointed with how Anandkumar acts on Twitter. For example, she said “you are an idiot” to a high school student young researcher for suggesting that we only teach about neural nets in ML classes.  She deleted the reply but then tweeted out another response, again referring to the original tweet as “idiocy”.

I totally agree with 99% of your stuff. All of them are great points. Although I will contest one of these points:  machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge diversity problem  I will say, in my experience, I did not find it to be particularly exclusionary. (I still agree on making the culture healthier and more welcoming for all people, but won't call it a huge diversity problem, that is any different from what plagues other fields) I also think it has very little to do with those in CS or intentional rejection of minorities/women by CS as a field. Far fewer women and minorities enroll in  CS, so it is more of a highschool problem than anything. If anything, CS tries really really hard to hire and attract under represented groups into the fold. That it fails, does not necessarily mean it is exclusionary. Many other social factors tend to be at play behind cohort statistics. An ML person knows that better than anyone.                There is a huge push towards hiring black and latino people and women as well. Far more than any other STEM field. Anyone who has gone to GHC knows how much money is spent on trying to make CS look attractive to women. ( I support both initiatives, but I do think enough is being done)  A few anecdotes from the hackernews thread the other day, as to greater social reasons for women not joining tech. Sample 1:  There's one other possible, additional reason. I recently asked a 17-year-old high school senior who is heading to college what she's planning to study, and she said it would be mathematics, biomedical engineering, or some other kind of engineering. She's self-motivated -- says she will be studying multi-variate calculus, PDEs, and abstract algebra on her own this summer. She maxed out her high school math curriculum, which included linear algebra as an elective. Naturally, I asked her about computer science, and she said something like this (paraphrasing): "The kids who love computers at my high school seem to be able to spend their entire day focusing on a computer screen, even on weekends. I cannot do that. And those kids are mostly boys whose social behavior is a little bit on the spectrum." While I don't fully agree with her perspective, it makes me wonder how many other talented people shun the field for similar reasons.  Sample2:   My niece had almost the exact same opinion despite having multiple family members who didn't fit that description, including her mother! It wasn't until I introduced her to some of my younger female co-workers that she committed to being a CS major. She's now a third generation software engineer, which has to be fairly unique. I've talked to her about it and she can't really articulate why. I'm closer to the nerd stereotype in that I'm on the computer a lot but her mother (my sister) definitely is not. I think it's mostly pop and teen culture still harboring the antisocial stigma. I'll have to talk to her some more. There is probably some connection with video games, in that boys overwhelmingly play games where girls do not. I don't think the games cause the disparity; whatever it is that draws boys to VGs is what draws them to CS as well  You can't blame the field for being unable to fight off stigma imposed by 80-90s movies on an entire generations. For example, there is no dearth of Indian women in CS. (I think it is similar for Chinese people too). Both societies did not undergo the collective humiliation of nerds that the US went through, and CS is considered a respectable 'high status' field, where people of any personality type can gel in. Thus, women do not face the same kind of intimidation. This is a "US high school and US culture" problem. Not a CS problem.   Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career.   To be fair, this is common to almost all academic fields. CS is no exception and I strongly support the having more accommodations for female employees in this regard.  Honestly, look at almost all "high stress, high workload" jobs and men are over-represented in almost all areas. Additionally, they tend to be a very particular kind of obsessive "work is life" kind of men. While women are discouraged form having such an unhealthy social life, men are actively pushed in this direction by society. IMO, we should not be seeking equality by pushing women to abide by male stereotypes. Maybe, if CS became a little better for everyone, it would benefit all kinds of people who are seeking healthier lives, men and women alike. This actually flows quite well into your next point of "cut-throat publish-or-perish mentality".

This is a great comment. I really like the points you mentioned. Pushing underrepresented groups into the field for the sake of representation doesn't seem like a good idea in the long run for any party in this problem. I find it extremely ironic that in both stories the girls are so heavily prejudiced towards CS people. I wish all people crying about female underrepresentation would notice that it's not usually about sexism in CS field but more about this stupid "nerdy loser with social anxiety" stereotype that is unattractive to people (and obviously false). But, as you said, this is a high-school problem (I'd even say that an elementary-school one).   I really can't understand why people behind all these promotional programs are so focused on fighting sexism for the good of young girls but at the same time they seem like they haven't even asked these girls what the real problem is. Maybe they could learn about the awful label of being "a little bit on the spectrum" (wtf?!) imprinted in kids' heads and come to a valuable conclusion that the problem they fight has its roots in completely different places.

Let's please give a shoutout to gwern here because he is brave enough to publicly state what a lot of us are thinking: https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1277662699279826944 This is what Taleb calls FU money. Gwern doesn't have to give a damn about being politically correct because it doesn't impact his career in the same way. He doesn't consider himself to be part of the traditional academic system driven by politics and obsessed with publishing irrelevant papers. Thank you, gwern! I wish there were more of you.

Good discussion. I'm not sure what I can do to help the problem. But I will always support any effort to suppress toxicity.

Every single issue listed here is right on the money. I am an MSc student at a top uni and although I have published a few papers in top conferences, the absolute stress and mental headache of the publish and perish mentality and the broader issues mentioned here is strongly motivating me to not pursue a PhD, although I had been set on doing so for a great while. For the first year of my masters, I was constantly reminded that I don't yet have a published paper yet, and without it (or some amazing internal references/connections) access to good research internships are rare, and without that, goes the chance to build connections and get exposure (the deepmind, Google hype that OP mentioned) that is crucial for success deeper into PhD and beyond. It's as if every step from the day you start uni must be perfectly placed, lest you be banished to academic wilderness. It also didn't help that my work was not in neural net/CV/NLP but in game theory+ML which is more niche meaning less visibility, less interesting to industry and others, and so on. Ofc, one does not and should not do research for "visibility" or "hype" or to publish only in a handful of venues skewed toward deep learning, but unfortunately this seems like the reality of our field. A great many days I honestly felt like I part of some strange cult and wondering what the hell I'm doing here. Even after publishing papers, I didn't feel this anxiety reduce by much. I honestly loved the work I did and the advisor and peers I worked it, who were all amazing. However, the broader setting is just deeply toxic. ML grad school feels like the cut-throat, constantly selling you and your work, virtue signalling yet indifferent mentality of industry combined with poverty wage and financial struggles of grad school. I hope that as a community, we listen and act instead of paying lip-service, accept that negative results and failed attempts are an important part of scientific research and not every paper must be SOTA to be meaningful, realize the myriad pressures grad students are under and setting the minimum threshold of success to be k papers/year at n conferences/journal doesn't make a great researcher but rather burnout or reward-hacking, stop putting certain people on pedestals, and we critically question the merits of industry dominating academia with half of top profs/departments being in their payroll in the name of some platitude.

At the root of these issues ... we've all noticed an aggressive push for "social justice" in the machine learning community. This has been organized by a small number of politically motivated activists who do not represent the community as a whole, outsiders who aren't ML experts themselves. Its impact on the community has been extremely negative. This can be seen in how LeCun was recently silenced on Twitter, or how some people are now claiming they should get more citations because of their skin color or gender.

At the root of these issues ... we've all noticed an aggressive push for "social justice" in the machine learning community. This has been organized by a small number of politically motivated activists who do not represent the community as a whole, outsiders who aren't ML experts themselves. Its impact on the community has been extremely negative. This can be seen in how LeCun was recently silenced on Twitter, or how some people are now claiming they should get more citations because of their skin color or gender.

 Fourthly, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive.   I understand why you might feel you have to say this, but it isn't true, and catering to that mindset is only going to provide a beachhead for future unreasonable backlashes. People who jumped on LeCun overplayed their hand, but they're still in the community, and will happily jump on other innocent remarks the second we let them think they've got a receptive audience for it. Saying that biased datasets cause problems is not a racist act, there are four lights.  People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.  Very big agree! We need to incentivize outreach and risk-taking.  Secondly, there is a reproducibility crisis. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to avoid this scenario (other than from a conference gatekeeper's perspective)? I've yet to see any.  If Method A is innately more able to get use out of hyperparameter tuning than Method B, then in some sense the only way to get a fair comparison between them is to tune the hyperparameters on both to the utmost limit. Abstaining from hyperparameter tuning seems like it means avoiding comparisons that are fair with respect to likely applications of interest.

Newbie here coming from an adjacent field, but if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like "tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice" means the tuning process and the final score reported are using the same set, which sounds troubling to me. Tuning hyperparameters on a test set leaks information about that test data into your model - I've understood the best practice to be using a separate validation set for tuning and then a test set for reporting, which you (ideally) only ever run your model on once so there's no leakage into how your model is built. If tuning on the same set you eventually report results with really standard practice these days? I get that in practice it's usually not feasible to only run on that test set a single time, but surely a tuning process that uses it is basically using your test set to train an aspect of your model, which sounds like a huge problem. And, if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like the solution is for reviewers to be incredibly wary of test set leakage into a training protocol.

Quite right, for the most part.     There's no clear consensus for making papers publicly available while under submission. One one side, it means the research is not available while under review which kind of defeats the whole purpose of research (sharing it with everyone, and not sitting around 2-3 months). On the other hand, sharing it and making posts everywhere does compromise anonymity: even if the reviewers don't search explicitly for the paper, they 're highly likely to stumble upon it if their research lies in that area (arXiv update tweets, gs updates, RTs by people they follow, etc). I guess a straightforward solution would be to have a version of arXiv with higher anonymity, where author affiliation is revealed only after decisions (to the journal/conference to which that research is submitted) have been made. We need to think much more about this specific problem.    Reproducibility is indeed an issue. I honestly don't know why we're in 2020 and machine learning papers can still get away without providing code/trained models. Evaluating the trained model (which is, in the majority of ML related papers, the result) by the reviewers via an open-source system, perhaps like a test-bed specific for applications? For instance, evaluating the robustness of a model on Imagenet. This, of course, should happen along with making code both compulsory and running it as well. This may be a problem for RL related systems, but this doesn't mean we shouldn't even try doing this for any of the submissions.    Very true. For some part, it's the responsibility of organizers to not always run after the top 5-6 names, and include younger researchers to help audiences get familiar with a more diverse (and most times, interesting) set of research and ideas. For the other part, it is also up to the researchers to draw the line when they see themselves talking about the same slides at multiple venues over and over again.    This specific instance is somewhat debatable. Compared to the level of backlash and toxicity women and people of color receive online is not even close to what he did. Nonetheless, the discussion could be much cleaner.    I agree with the first half. I do see companies doing something about this, but surely not enough. Also, it's a bit sad/sketchy that most AI research labs do not openly release statistics about their gender/ethnicity distributions. "People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem. " There's a very clear difference between 'engage' and 'tone-police'. As long as you're doing the former, I don't see why you should be "afraid".   True (but isn't this a problem with nearly every field of science? Countless animals are mutilated and experimented upon in multiple ways for things as frivolous as hair gel) I guess, for instance, people working in NLP could be more careful (or rather, simply avoid) scraping Reddit to help stop the propagation of biases/hate, etc. Major face-recognition providing companies have taken steps to help curb the potential harms of AI, and there is surely scope for more.    " Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS." I'd think most of such people would only be remotely associated with the actual work. Most students/researchers/advisors I know who work on a research project (either via actually leading it or a substantial amount of advising) have no more than 5-6 NeurIPS submissions a year? Nevertheless, universities should be a little relaxed about such 'count' based rules.    "Everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved. ". It's not like Anandkumar woke up one fine day and said "you know what? I hate LeCun". Whatever the researchers in your examples have accused others of, it has been true for the most part. I don't see how calling out someone for sexist behavior by calling them 'sexist' is disrespectful if the person being accused quite visibly is. All of these instances may not directly be tied with research or our work, but it would be greatly ignorant to pretend that we all are just machines working on science, and have no social relations or interactions with anyone. The way you interact with people, the way they interact with you: everything matters. If someone gets called out for sexist behavior and we instantly run to defend such "tags" as "disrespectful", I don't see how we can solve the problem of representation bias in this community.    Also, kinda funny that a 'toxicity' related discussion is being started on Reddit. lol  
Per point #1, it seems like it should be possible to submit a paper to a site like arXiv with provisional anonymity -- either time- or date-based that allows the paper to be posted publicly while also not divulging the author prior to peer review.

OMG, I think this is the best use of GANs I've ever seen. I'll definitely give it a try ! Also, what's the song playing in this video ? :)

Thank you so much for sharing this. I'd love to try it out on a song I made however when I substitute the file path for my file path I keep getting error not found raised. this is the file path i insert after "song = ": /Users/username/Downloads/song.mp3 sorry I know ur not like stack exchange or something but if i could get some help i would be super grateful

If your system is >= python3.8, it won't work as this library imports TF 1.15 and python3.8 only supports TF2. No luck.  
Thanks. I'm facing that problem now. I expect that it will be common.  
Very much so, seems like a pretty big oversight by the dev. Really wanted to get it working but not enough to try any more lol.  
If you use anaconda it's very easy to set up a new environment with the old version of python

This is awesome, hoping to give it a try. Running into an error: "Conv2DCustomBackpropInputOp only supports NHWC" I think it's trying to use my CPU instead of GPU... anyone have ideas?

This is clearly not for tripophobic people.  
"Trypophobia" is not actually a thing FYI. It's just a natural response from the brain to certain patterns that was popularized by the internet and it was never recognized as an actual phobia by medical experts  
Ha next you'll be telling me imposter syndrome isn't a real syndrome! (/s just in case that wasn't obvious)

I hate and at the same time love that you feel like you can just about make out what the object or scene depicted is, yet after a moment or two you realize that whatever you've seen wasn't there, like a mirage.

Watching this high, you’re right. Its like a dissolving whatever your imagining. It’s like the story is what u make it

What music is that? Sounds nice !  
This song started autoplaying in my reddit r/all feed, and then I refreshed and lost the song forever. Or so I thought. I'd finally come to grips with the hard reality that I'd never be able to find this song again, until suddenly, the song is used in this post, two days latrr. Shazammed it and here it is: Raspberry, by Saje

This is surprisingly cool, but I feel it would be even cooler if it actually synchronized with the beat rather than the sound energy.

My friend has a band with a few songs and I think it would be a cool surprise to use one of their songs with this package. Just wanted to ask how would you like to be credited for the work. The band is super small and if they wanted to put it as a youtube video I don't think they would monetize it but I'd still want them to somehow credit you. Just hypothetically if they were to like the outcome or I can of course just give them the surprise and say the author isn't open to people sharing their own videos with the package if that's the case also.  ​ Really awesome work though!!  
I'd absolutely be okay with that - that's the point of me making this open-source! To credit, you can simply say that the video was made with Lucid Sonic Dreams, and include a link to either the article, the Instagram account, or the YouTube account :)

Mr /u/RightWingIsLowIQ, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

Can you make the weights thicker/thinner or different colour depending on their magnitude?  
Assuming that would be implemented by default, I was looking at this graphic for several minutes trying to understand why I couldn’t make sense of that part.

Hey guys, original creator here. I made a video about this project, which I did for a visualization class at Technical University Vienna (TU Wien), 2 years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8psghc/project_realtime_interactive_visualization_of/ The code / Unity project can be found here: https://github.com/stefsietz/nn-visualizer, but it is not in a state of good code quality, so maybe try one of the forks or a project like https://tensorspace.org/, which seems to accomplish similar visualizations and looks like it's well maintained. The "pulse" animation was basically just a test of the visualization's ability to expand one "spatially shared kernel" into the actual per pixel kernels as used during computation. This sudden attention comes really unexpected as this video was just a short WIP clip I shared on IG 2 years ago.Right now I am working at the really awesome AI company kaleido.ai on products such as remove.bg, unscreen.com and more.

I made a video about this project, which I did for a visualization class at Technical University Vienna (TU Wien), 2 years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8psghc/project_realtime_interactive_visualization_of/ The code / Unity project can be found here: https://github.com/stefsietz/nn-visualizer, but it is not in a state of good code quality, so maybe try one of the forks or a project like https://tensorspace.org/, which seems to accomplish similar visualizations and looks like it's well maintained. The "pulse" animation was basically just a test of the visualization's ability to expand one "spatially shared kernel" into the actual per pixel kernels as used during computation. This sudden attention comes really unexpected as this video was just a short WIP clip I shared on IG 2 years ago.Right now I am working at the really awesome AI company kaleido.ai on products such as remove.bg, unscreen.com and more. And we are hiring ;-) https://www.remove.bg/careers

I just made my project public on GitHub, which seems similar to yours https://github.com/julrog/nn_vis  
How do we make a " processed  neural  network file "(such as a ".pro" style file)  
Right now I have an example script for a simple dense neural network on MNIST data under examples/process_mnist_model.py . I don't have a automated function yet. To create such a file for another neural network you have to code a bit and provide a small subset (maybe <  10%) of the training/test data and unfortunately only dense layers are supported, but I might add support for different layers (convolutional) with examples.  
I found this example "process_mnist_model.py", but it doesn't work due to the version of tensorflow and python. Maybe your code can be adjusted to support the latest version.

do you leave the agent to learn airdribbling (or whatever else) on his own like over many attempts, or do you feed him suggestions or directions? i'm here from r/all, idk anything about machine learning. edit: fun fact though, i do play rl and know how to airdribble and kuxir twist (constant barrel roll), so this is cool to see.  
Hey, not op but I work with these technologies. He is using something called reinforcement learning. The AI is told it's goal (keep the ball in the air as long as possible) and then given access to the controls. The AI starts off moving randomly, but after a while it has learned to air dribble.  
that's amazing. another question - would it be possible to add speed into the mix? i'm interested because this is a big thing in rl, finding the fastest way to make any play. so if the goal for this ai was adjusted to something like 'get the ball over there to that spot, as fast as possible' is that something that the ai can figure out, like what the fastest possible time the play can be made in is? better example would be 'airdribble the ball over to that spot as fast as possible' in which case i'd wonder if the ai would learn then to airdribble in a different way than what is shown in op's post. would it keep trying everything in order to know what's possible, and basically keep trying forever, or would it reach some threshold with one method and assume it couldn't get any faster and just stick with that. does there need to be a boundary or is 'as possible' a usable parameter?

Neat! What's the reward function? Are you rewarding it for going to the right spot/angle based on "known" physics, or are you just rewarding it for keeping it in the air?

Love this! I just started playing around with [RLBot](https://rlbot.org/) and have thinking about using this as a way to teach myself about continuous control in my copious spare time.  What was the motivation for cloning the game physics rather than using RLBot? DM me to play some RL sometime

What is the shape of the collision boxes at the impact point?  
https://samuelpmish.github.io/notes/RocketLeague/car_ball_interaction/ In the original game the hitbox is very simple  
Does it really not cover the bottom part of the car? Not even the body of the car?  
What do you mean by "not covering the bottom the car"? You can of course hit the ball with the bottom of the car which allows skilled players to go for things like "flipresets". The hitbox is only kinda related to the body of the car. There are about 20 different cars (probably more) and only 5 or 6 different hitboxes for the cars. All cars sharing a hitbox are completely identical and all differences are purely cosmetical. (Same goes for add-ons for your car. 100% cosmetical)

This is amazing! So I’m a SDE but doing something like these in my spare time would be awesome! What skills are necessary to start doing stuff like this? I see Unity, so C# there right? Is the ML in Python? What would be a good baseline to start in this simulation type stuff? Thank you! This is maybe the coolest thing I’ve seen this month.  
Unity actually has ML Agents with a few sample environments. Purely C# example is described here: http://ml.blogs.losttech.software/Reinforcement-Learning-With-Unity-ML-Agents/

Oh my gosh, I've been wanting for this to become a reality -- especially after seeing OpenAI play DOTA. Rocket league is a real physics simulation with an infinite skillcap, so I can't wait to see what bots are capable of. Could you train the agent to air dribble while carrying? (minimize distance from ball to car while air dribbling) edit: looks like you already did this, but without a destination it just sits still!

Yeah.  It definitely requires a written version of the language actually exists.  
Why not just write it out phonetically?  
Not all written system can support that. For instance, there’s a limit to what the common English alphabet write out certain complex phonemes. IPA is the best, but it’s very complex for an average person to learn.

Humanity is a total fabrication, and boy are the vast majority of the people that call Zuck a robot totally bought into the idea that they themselves transcend the mechanical reality of the universe.

He does seem to be genuinely enjoying overseeing the research moonshots they're doing at the moment. You can see this when he talks about VR, too.  
Not related but I wish Meta were spending more of its brain cycles on not-stupid things. From where I'm standing just looking at open source work, the talent there is head and shoulders above the other big 5 companies and it bums me out that some portion of that is being spent on cartoon legs.

 and it bums me out that some portion of that is being spent on cartoon legs.  Simple answer is that research showed a lack of a complete body removed peoples immersion. So the solutions were either develop complex tech to do pose prediction and FK/IK to match the world you're in. Or add hardware to track the legs via cameras, or physical tracking devices. There's a lot of groundwork being done for things to come later. The early days is a bunch of stuff that feels like cheap tricks or pointless bullshit. But the sum of them is what VR will rest on later

Damn I'm out of the loop.  What has he done that has been so detrimental to society?  
This is only one specific example of many.  In many parts of the developing world paying for mobile data plans is a burdensome expense, so Facebook has agreements with service providers around the world that makes Facebook free to access.  While this seem like a positive or neutral thing at first, the result is Facebook becomes the ENTIRE accessible internet for the vast majority of people in those locations.  Just look up the atrocities that where committed in Myanmar the past few years. Essentially zero moderation or oversight was put in place since it’s a different language, and as a result the worst aspects of human nature ran unchecked into a feedback loop of hate resulting in fucking ethnic cleansing!!!

facebook is a top tier company for sure, they've developed a lot of great tech used my millions of devs and companies. the company has tons of the most talented devs out there. but the app itself is a dumpster fire that is a huge contributor to a lot of geopolitical problems. facebook only cares about its bottom line, just like every other shitty evil corp out there. needless to say this is really cool tech.

Why does it wait for the whole phrase to finish before translating? Surely it could start after a second or two was buffered and allow near realtime babelfishing. Surely it could also do it in their voices once it had a big enough sample. :D  
Hiya. That is generally not how language is processed. First of all, the syntax of languages differs greatly, for example English is Subject Verb Object so we figure out who's doing a thing at the start of a sentence, and find out what it's been done to at the end. This differs from languages like Korean wherein you don't figure out who's doing something until the end. This can pose a challenge to realtime translation, as to the other listener your sentences would sound unnatural. Furthermore, the greatest accuracy for the sentence, accounting for homonyms etc, will be once all of the inputs are collected, the correct transforms applied, optimizations created and then rendering.  TLDR; Fast realtime = less accurate. Product demos require accuracy or people will tear you apart for even the smallest trifles, so slow and accurate is better here.

[D] Our community must get serious about opposing OpenAI
The biggest issue is that they've started a trend and now most probably all the other AI/ML major forces will stop releasing their findings or at least restrict what gets published. It would probably happen sooner or later but it's pretty ironic it started with OpenAI  
Ultimately the fact that even simple details like parameter size aren't being revealed shows how little moat they have. No doubt they've done their polishing and improvements but there's no secret sauce that's being done here that can't be replicated in a few months tops. We've had more efficient attention for a while now. The answer still seems to be Bigger Scale = Better Results. There are bigger hurdles here like cost and data.  
Yeah, that is my read too. It's a bigger, better, more expensive GPT3 with an image input module bolted onto it, and more expensive human-mediated training, but nothing fundamentally new.  It's a better version of the product, but not a fundamentally different technology. GPT3 was largely the same way--the main thing that makes it better than GPT2 is size and fine-tuning (i.e. investment and product work), not new ML discoveries. And in retrospect, we know that GPT3 is pretty compute-inefficient both during training and inference. Few companies innovate repeatedly over a long period of time. They're eight years in and their product is GPT. It's time to become a business and start taking over the world as best as they can. They'll get their slice for sure, but a lot of other people are playing with this stuff and they won't get the whole pie.

Exactly - we can’t be 100% certain of course - but all signs point to the fact that their success is primarily driven not by significant technical innovation but by data engineering, collection and scaling.  For speech - where say whisper is concerned - I have enough background to state this pretty confidently, but is he very very surprised to find out that there is some dramatic new tech driving gptx now, rather than data engineering.  Whisper is “good” but it’s also insanely bloated and slow.  Those are all engineering problems which are much easier to solve in general by throwing resources at the problem. This explains their behavior well as well.  I think they were surprised themselves at the success of a couple of these - particularly chatgpt and this flipped the “don’t be evil switch” into “infinite greed mode”. If true the best solution would be a Mozilla style approach to expand curated data sets, couple with general funding for compute.  
The key question is if any innovation is even necessary for AGI, or if it's all just a matter of scaling and refining. If it isn't, the fact that OpenAI doesn't "innovate" won't matter.

Exactly this. I think MS investment came too early for them. AI is in very early stages and there’s a very long road to travel still and whoever tries to do it behind closed doors will fail to keep up pretty quickly. Just look at Apple, unfortunately OpenAI is headed the same way.  
Is it?  Are you sure we are not near endgame?  Just a couple more generations and the plots suggest a system about as good at working on AI design as the top 0.1 percent humans.  (That system is going to need a lot of weights and a lot of training data) We are at top 20 percent right now and AI "thinking" has inherent advantages.

Realistically only the big tech companies with deep pockets could compete with OpenAI. Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, etc. There is a pretty big moat between OpenAI and all the small startups that have no where near the scale to build an AGI.  
Are you assuming OpenAI is anywhere close to an AGI? I'm pretty skeptical

It won't end it, but it will slow it down and result in a "tiered" system. The Big Boys will have top-of-the-line AIs and the rest of us will have previous-generation ones to play with. I expect that was already going to be the case, there will be big three-letter-agency projects going on behind closed doors to build their own AIs regardless of whether OpenAI and its ilk remained open. Still disappointing, though, even if it was expected.  
Even with fully open software, how many of us have the hardware or cloud spend required to train what will be truly massive models?  There is going to be a capital rush to power these sorts of things and it's not going to be a game the rest of us get to play for very long without access to some very deep pockets.

Actually, now you have me curious, are all of DeepMind's latest developments open source?  I thought they were pretty secretive about a few models as well, in which case OpenAI wouldn't be the first.  Of course, it would still be more egregious for OpenAI, given their name and supposed mission. On an unrelated note, I'm reminded of an interesting fact I learned a while back about the Allied efforts to crack the Enigma code.  Right at the beginning in 1932 the Polish cryptographer Marian Rejewski was able to construct an Enigma machine from scratch almost entirely using intercepted messages.  I wonder if we could similarly devise some tests to reverse engineer the architecture of an LLM based on its responses.  
Might not be able to get at the underlying architecture any time soon, but getting most or at least a large chunk of the data used for fine tuning from a model should be pretty easy according to the Stanford Alpaca fine tune of LLaMA 7b, as discussed by Eliezer Yudkowsky on Twitter  
This would be the end of innovation. GPT-X were built on top of previous open source research.  
This is naive.  More money than ever will be shoveled into this, innovation isn't going to stop.  
The key is the kind of innovation. The open and publicly available kind will be harder to justify in industry

OpenAI followed the Google playbook. Their “non profit” and “open” start of the company is basically the equivalent of “do no evil” was for Google early publicity. There will be a backlash but everyone is always severely lagged reactive.

https://www.popsci.com/technology/microsoft-ai-team-layoffs/ Well at least Microsoft is honest about scrapping their ethical team surrounding AI. Not sure where I read this, but the company that will use the least restricted ai, will have the most advantage. I think that sounds quite logical.

I still dont understand how stable diffusion gets sued for their open source model but openai, which almost certainly used even more copyright data, get to sell gpt. Why arent they being sued too? Is it right to privatize public data that was used without consent in an LLM, which no one could even have predicted would exist 5 years ago to even give consent?  
 Why arent they being sued too? Is it right to privatize public data that was used without consent in an LLM, which no one could even have predicted would exist 5 years ago to even give consent?  They don't provide their training data, so we don't even know. So you would have to sue them on the belief that they used some of your copyrighted material and then hope that you are proven right during discovery. Who would sue them? Stable Diff is sued by Getty Images, who have the financial power to do that. OpenAI is not some small start up anymore. Suing OpenAI at this point means you are actually going up against Microsoft. Nobody wants to do that. At best you could maybe try a class action lawsuit, arguing there is a class of "writers who had their copyright violated", but how will you ever know who belongs to that class  
There is precedent for extracting training data from LLM without the training set, dunno if it would work for gpt4 tho: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805 I guess it's hard to say who would sue but I still think there is a good case. NLL loss is equivalent to MDL compression objective, and compressing an image and selling it almost certainly violates copyright (not a lawyer tho lol...) mathematically, LLM are at least to some extent performing massive scale flexible information compression. If you train and LLM on one book and sell, you're stealing. Should it be different just bc scale? I dunno but I personally don't think so  
Is there any legal precedence to argue that training on copyrighted data actually violates that copyright? I genuinely don't know. If I was OpenAI, in this hypothetical law suit, I would make the argument that they're not actually selling the copyrighted data. They're doing something akin to taking a book, reading it, and acquiring the knowledge in it, then applying it. So it would be akin to saying you cant read a textbook on how to build a thing and then sell the thing you build. (Don't misunderstand, I'm not saying that that's what an LLM actually does, but that's what I would say to defend the practice)

 Why arent they being sued too?  1) Ambulance chasing lawyers would rather go after the smaller fish first, win/settle with SD, and then (hopefully) establish a precedent that they can then use to bang on OpenAI's door. 2) OpenAI's lack of disclosure around their data sets is (probably by design) going to make suing them much harder.  
Which will further push people to close of their work

What I find most irritating is that as someone who does work in ML, but I would like to work more directly on sota models, suddenly it creates this information wall around each lab.  Meaning unless I can join the staff of OpenAI, Deepmind, or Facebook AI research directly - all of which have very high hiring bars that are likely now as high as quant right now or higher - I will not even know what the cutting edge is. These tiny elite few (a few k people max) are the only ones in the know.  
Correct. This completely shoots themselves in the foot long term, as the more restrictive they are the slower their future progress. Open collaborative research, even if not open end products, is an entirely different ecosystem from closed research and closed products. I have to wonder if there's been pressure at a state level. A lot of people are focused on what was going on with Meta as an open competitor as what's behind this, but also in the recent news have been Chinese efforts to catch up. AI development has already become a proxy arms race (i.e. MS controlling drones with a LLM), and it may be that funding sources or promises relating to regulatory oversight at a state level were behind this with the aim not of cutting you off, or Google or Meta even, but of foreign actors. Though I still think that's nearsighted, as this is arguably the most transformative technology in all of human history, and as such the opportunity costs of slowed progress are as literally unfathomable as the potential costs of its acceleration.

One possible solution is to open / start an elite state-funded agency that explicitly focuses on ML / AI, funded by tax dollars - and where all the produced work is open source. Think of it like academia on steroids.  You'd need a budget large enough to pay a salary that falls between Academia and SOTA companies - I mean, the best thing would be to match the salaries of those companies, but that's just a pipe dream. And enough funds to be competitive on the research side (infrastructure, etc.).  Agencies like NASA, ESA, etc. have multiple billion dollar annual budgets.

The rubber is finally meeting the road on this issue. Honestly, given the economic stakes for deploying these models (which is all any corp cares about, getting these models to make money) this was going to happen eventually. This being closed sourced "rushed" (for the lack of a better term) models with little transparency. I would not be surprised if this gets upped to an even further extreme; I can imagine in the not so far future we get "here's an API, it's for GPT-N, here's it's benchmarks, and thats all you need to know."  And to be frank, I don't see this outlook improving, whatsoever. Let's say each and every person who is a current member of the ML community boycotts OpenAI. What about the hungry novices/newcomers/anyone curious who have a slight CS background (or less), but have never had the resources previously to utilize models in their applications or workflows? As we can all see with the flood of posts of the "here's my blahblahblah using ChatGPT" or "How do I train LLama on my phone?" variety to any relevant sub, the novice user group is getting bigger day by day. Will they be aware and caring enough to boycott closed modeling practices? Or will they disregard that for the pursuit of money/notoriety, hoping their application takes off? I think I know the answer. ML technology is reaching the threshold that (and I feel sick making the comparison) crypto did in terms of accessibility a few years back, for better or worse. Meaning there will always be new people wanting to utilize these tools who don't care about training/productionizing a model, just that it works as advertised. Right now, I don't think(?) This group outnumbers researchers/experienced ML engineers, but eventually it will if not already.  I hate to be a downer, but I don't see any other way. I would adore to be proved wrong.

 Right now, I don't think(?) This group outnumbers researchers/experienced ML engineers, but eventually it will if not already.   The insanely cheap rates of ChatGPT are going to change this, if they haven't already. You don't need to know anything at all about ML - you just need to pull in a library, drop your token in, and away you go. It's only going to get even more embedded as libraries are built around the API and specific prompts, too. Credit where it's due, OpenAI are very good at productionising their entirely closed source model!  
People forget that Sam Altman was the president of Ycombinator for 5 years. He’s seen what makes or breaks startups, what makes them hot, and how to go viral  
That hasn't stopped YC from laying off 20% of their staff recently. YC screws up, just like everybody else.

 The insanely cheap rates of ChatGPT are going to change this  Like how Uber or AirBnB was cheap at first  
I think it'll be a bit different. Uber was not profitable in the beginning because the prices were too low, so they could monopolize the market. ​ OpenAI is probably not profitable yet because of the lack of volume, but not because their prices are low. Once the model is trained, inference is cheap.  ​ That doesn't mean they won't raise prices if they ever manage to monopolize this market, of course.

This is the new reality. AI has been in research mode while people were trying to figure out how to make products out of it. That time has come. The community of sharing is quickly going to be a thing of the past as the competition gets more and more cutthroat.  The next step is going to be even worse: integrating ads. Can't wait for GPT-5, brought to you by Coca-Cola.  
Not brought to you by, I'm certain it'll be embedded into your results. The ai itself will steer you to the ad in it's many responses. Writing a story - the character will drink coca cola, creating a sales letter - x product is refreshing like coca cola, summarizing some research - these result bubbled up like coca cola, etc. It's been trained on that data from the political arena we just went through, it's abilities to do that are child play. It just needs to be told to do it. Ugh.

By alienating the entire AI community, they can only go so far. I mean even if they were to release the weights of GPT-4 along with details, the AI community would have loved them and they could still profit off from it by deploying these models at scale that I don't think any organization can do. Like in case of whisper, even if they open-sourced the entire stack, them providing those APIs still allows them to profit off from these models. Not to mention the immense amount of free research and development that goes in the open source, they can also benefit from it.

But what would you do with the weights if released though? You need close to 200k in purchased GPUs just to run inference on the orgy of parameters that GPT4 is.  The model itself and the way research is nowadays done is the problem.  
 the orgy of parameters  What a wonderful way to put it!

FWIW, if you are an academic researcher (which not everyone is, obviously), the big players closing up is probably long-term net good for you: 1) Whether something is "sufficiently novel" to publish will likely be much more strongly benchmarked against the open source SOTA; 2) This will probably create more impetus for players with less direct commercial impetus, like Meta, to do expensive things (e.g., trains) and share the model weights.  If they don't, they will quickly find that there are no other peers (Google, OpenAI, etc.) who will publicly push the research envelope with them, and I don't think they want to nor have the commercial incentives to go it alone; 3) You will probably (unless openai gets its way with regulation/FUD...which it very well may) see increased government support for capital-intensive (training) research; and, 4) Honestly, everyone owes OpenAI a giant thank-you for productizing LLMs.  If not for OpenAI and its smaller competitors, we'd all be staring dreamily at vague Google press releases about how they have AGI in their backyard but need to spend another undefined number of years considering the safety implications of actually shipping a useful product.  The upshot of this is that there are huge dollars flowing into AI/ML that net are positive for virtually everyone who frequents this message board (minus AGI accelerationist doomers, of course). The above all said... There is obviously a question of equilibrium.  If, e.g., things move really fast, then you could see a world where Alphabet, OpenAI, and a small # of others are so far out ahead that they just suck all of the oxygen out of the room--including govt dollars (think the history of government support for aerospace R&D, e.g.). Now, the last silver lining, if you are concerned about OpenAI-- I think there is a big open question of if and how OpenAI can stay out ahead.  To date, they have very, very heavily stood on the shoulders of Alphabet, Meta, and a few others.  This is not to understate the work they have done--particularly on the engineering side--but it is easy to underestimate how hard and meandering "core" R&D is.  If Alphabet, e.g., stops sharing their progress freely, how long will OpenAI be able to stay out ahead, on a product level?   OpenAI is extremely well funded, but "basic" research is extremely hard to do, and extremely hard to accelerate with "just" buckets of cash. Additionally, as others have pointed out elsewhere, basic research is also extremely leaky.  If they manage to conjure up some deeply unique insights, someone like Amazon will trivially dangle some 8-figure pay packages to catch up (cf. the far less useful self-driving cars talent wars).   (Now, if you somehow see OpenAI moving R&D out of CA and into states with harsher non-compete policies, a la most quant funds...then maybe you should worry...) Lastly, if you hold the view that "the bitter lesson" (+video, +synthetic world simulations) is really the solution to all our problems, then maybe OpenAI doesn't need to do much basic research, and this is truly an engineering problem.  But if that is the case, the barrier is mostly capital and engineering smarts, which will not be a meaningful impediment to top-tier competitors, if they truly are on the AGI road-to-gold. tldr; I think the market will probably smooth things out over the next few years...unless we're somehow on a rapid escape velocity for the singularity.  
That's a very cogent explanation and I agree with most of it. The only concern I have is that these LLMS completely obliterate the smaller task specific models on most benchmarks. I wonder how NLP research in Academia would proceed in the short term when you have a competing model but can't really compare against it as the models aren't reproducible  
The same way NLP researchers are already doing it: compare against a similarly sized model, demonstrate scaling and let the people with money worry about testing it at the largest scales.  
 demonstrate scaling  Although this part can be very hard for researchers.  A lot of things that look good at smaller scale disappear at scale beyond what researchers can reasonably do without major funding. Perhaps someone (Meta?) should put out a paper about how to identify whether a new technique/modification is likely to scale?--whether or not this is even doable, of course, is questionable.

Honestly GPT3 hasn’t outperformed at most orgs I’ve been in and it’s expensive and slow. Not sure yet how v4 will turn out but I wouldn’t write things off yet  
Not sure why you're downvoted for this. I can imagine specialised models outperforming GPT3 in many if not most tasks.

Well, the EleutherAI people banned me for saying that climate change was a greater threat than AGI and that Elon Musk is an idiot, so I'm gonna go ahead and say that the "random anons on a Discord server" model isn't great either.  
Isn’t EleutherAI founded by AGI doomers like Connor Leahy who thinks AGI is right around the corner (2-3 years) and will kill us all? I mean…obviously if someone earnestly believes that, they’re going to think you’re an idiot and tell you to F off.

I think ultimately the research lab or company that attracts the best AI talent will stay ahead in this AI race. There’s only so much money you can throw at researchers, beyond a point a researcher is more motivated by being able to share their work with their peers.  AI hasn’t reached a space where it becomes a engineering problem, OpenAI/MS are wrong in assuming that it has imo. There’s still so much fundamental progress to be made and the longer you spend in your closed lab, the more you deviate from open source the more harder and expensive it becomes for you to incorporate the newer ideas from external breakthroughs into your stack.  I think Meta with its investment in PyTorch and having no immediate need to go all in on monetizing their AI investment is in the best place in the industry right now. Google is also in a commanding position but they are unnecessarily reacting to every news from MS/OpenAI.

Sorry, but, how are closed model anything but good for alignment and safety? Don't get me wrong, I love OSS, I spent 3 years of my life working pretty tirelessly on fully open source ML libraries. But let's be reasonable, alignment research hasn't shown great use of open models and the biggest threat as it stands is human actors using models to accelerate and enable very dangerous practices. Models being guarded behind a company (that's worried about being sued, if nothing else) is good. Otherwise, it seems that most alignment/safety people agree delaying capabilities is good. Making SOTA research close will cause divergence and make it increasingly hard to advance the SOTA since now you've reduced the number of people that can improve on it directly to a small fraction of what I'd be before. Would you care to actually lay out a reasonable argument as to why being closed source and not publishing research is bad from this angle? Again, I'm not even agreeing with it being closed overall, but using the safety angel to argue that seems silly.

Support open source alternatives until they inevitably sell out you mean.....  
Open source can't sell out, as it's developed by volunteers worldwide: if you were to change the license, you would have to get permission from every single volunteer (assuming they chose [L/A]GPL, I don't think MIT includes such protection).

I think "opposing OpenAI" is politically misguided, as if singling out a company as researchers or consumers has relevance to the industry as a whole or ever proved to work. We should get serious about regulating AI, creating a tangible baseline of due diligence and open reporting for models that operate under risk. Now, is that going to fly well in the research community? Hardly.  On one side regulation would force top players to disclose and open up details or assets that researchers can tap into. On the other side academic research is often run with very light compliance oversight and a risk taking attitude. For example remember that in the Cambridge analytica scandal a group of university researchers was the key middleman in the extraction of massive amounts of private sensitive data from Facebook.

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

I noticed that. Generally it’s “right enough” to help you fix your error, though.  
I wouldn't say that. While I'm definitely impressed by its abilities It makes mistakes way too often for me to consider it "generally correct".  It is interesting that even when it makes a mistake it often has some reasonable sounding logic behind it. It makes it feel like it has some level of "understanding".  
yeah it is annoyingly confidently wrong. Even when you point out its mistake, it might try to explain like no mistakes where made. Sometimes it admits that there was a mistake. From a coworker this would be really annoying behaviour.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: ``` Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened: Traceback ... ...  Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace: broken.py  1 ...  2 ... ... 11 ...  ``` I would aggregate those lines in a map of file_name: str -> line_numbers: set where you basically do lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely.  If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly.   This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.  
You're going hard with the waste of electricity bs. The guy did a cool project, your comment is not constructive at all and just mean I like his project, it's true that as a begginer these errors could be hard to understand sometimes. I don't think you should be mean and disrespectful to him if you don't like his idea. Ypu should come up with more ideas to make his idea better. It would be a better use of electricity than just what you did.  
Sustainability in ML and HPC is a huge part of my job.  If you dont consider that important and think its bs that doesnt actually change that an important part of my job is to consider it. At no point was I mean to OP. Im not being mean to a person who is littering by telling them not to litter. And I'm not being mean to a person making and distributing confetti as their hobby by pointing out how it is also littering.  
We're not at you job. It's a reddit post about someone who's trying to build a tool to help other people. If you're so good at your job, you might want to give insight or knowledge on how to improve his project. Just saying the project is trash and a waste is not helping anybody here

 The error message literally explained it to you concisely.   Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.  
Then maybe the programming student should read a book that covers debugging. They can read that in an offline fashion, and then apply that knowledge when it comes up in practice.

Could be useful for beginners I guess  
I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.  
Honest question, do you consider the environmental impact of how you are using this to avoid very basic and easy to do tasks?  
Amusing question. It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. Inference actually isn't that energy expensive for GPT type models. And the way I used it, it's probably more useful than generating AI art.

Consistent Video Depth Estimation paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15021 project site: https://roxanneluo.github.io/Consistent-Video-Depth-Estimation/ video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tia2oblJAg Edit: just noticed previous discussions already on r/machinelearning (https://redd.it/gba7lf)  
Is this similar to what Tesla is doing with their vision based depth estimation?  
Yes, this is certainly similar. As far as I understand from Andrej's talk, the vision-based depth estimation in Tesla uses self-supervised monocular depth estimation models. These models process each frame independently and thus the estimated depth maps across frames are not geometrically consistent. Our core contribution in this work is how we can extract geometric constraints from the video and use them to fine-tune the depth estimation model to produce globally consistent depth.  
Could you please link the talk you're referring to? would love to check it out

Could the techniques that you use to get temporarily stable and coherent output also be applied to segmentation in order to get robust mattes for objects? If you could run a piece of footage through a system like yours and get out a stable depth plus antialiased segmentation map, that would a very valuable tool in visual effects.

This could be used for smartphones faking depth of field right? I wonder what the VR/AR applications could be  
The method is computationally expensive; thus not really suitable for real-time applications. I think this would be great offline processing, e.g. photogrammetry, visual effects, etc. From the paper:  For a video of 244 frames, training on 4 NVIDIA Tesla M40GPUs takes 40min

In the paper they state that they fine tune the model for each video at test time, so the 40 minutes is required for any new footage.

Test-time training. Model must be fine tuned to each video sample, unfortunately. However, we can expect later papers that can skip or greatly reduce this step imo.

The depth estimation model they compare to (and are likely using as their first step same as 3d photo inpainting) takes at worst 1 second to run on most modern CPUs. It's really difficult for me to believe that adding the additional geometric constraint ups the compute time this bad. I'm also maybe a tad jaded from having read the 3d photo inpainting repo (another project from the same team) only to realize that out of roughly 3 minutes that it takes, only about 15 seconds are spent on neural nets and most of the rest is millions of mesh operations in pure Python.  
You are absolutely correct. I believe that there are alternatives to achieve similar geometrically consistent depth for a video. This is exciting future research. Re: 3D photo inpainting:Yes, the inference is extremely redundant and the implementation is entirely unoptimized at this point. There are many ways to improve runtime performance. We hope the community will further push this forward!

Training is not inference.  Inference is generally several orders of magnitude faster.  
Except that it needs to be fine tuned on each video. Sometimes training “times” are entangled with inference times if the structure used requires re-training or fine-tuning.

This paper "Unsupervised Scale-consistent Depth and Ego-motion Learning from Monocular Video (NIPS 2019)" can also achieve 'consistent depth estimation in Video'. And it is more efficient in inference phase (real-time). See dense reconstruction demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4wZr79_pD8  GitHub: https://github.com/JiawangBian/SC-SfMLearner-Release  
 See dense reconstruction demo   See dense reconstruction demo  Thanks, Jiawang. Yes, we are aware of your work (see the citation and the discussion in the paper). Pre-training the depth estimation network with geometric constraints is a very interesting idea. However, at test time, the depth prediction of video frames remain inconsistent (as there are no longer constraints). This inconsistency issue is amplified when we work with regular cellphone videos in the wild (as opposed to a closed world like the KITTI dataset).  That being said, I believe having models with efficient runtime like your approach is critical for wider adaptation, but there are still several steps we need to solve to get there.  
Hi Jia-Bin, thanks for your reply. I agree with you. Only CNN prediction is not sufficient to achieve the globally consistent results, where a post-refinement is necceary. Actually I also try to do that recently. Congratulations for your nice work, and many details really inspire me. Look forward for your further improvement.

Normally I'd be on your side, but I do think it's important for this sub to stay vigilant about being a place for deep discussion of machine learning where questions like that are out of place. Questions that can be easily googled probably shouldn't be upvoted, imo  
Is this supervised, Unsupervised or Reinforcement Learning ?  
If I understand the paper correctly, they pre-train the model using COLMAP and Mask R-CNN to get a semi-dense depth map for any frame. They then improve the depth maps at test time by randomly sampling frames from the video and re-training the model using "spatial loss" and "disparity loss", which are defined in the article. Mask R-CNN is traditional, supervised learning for object segmentation. COLMAP and this model appear to be unsupervised, since there are no reference depth maps being used for the loss. Instead, the loss for COLMAP and this model appears to be based on whether frames which capture similar regions of the scene have similar depth maps. At least, that's what I understood from the paper – someone smarter than me will hopefully come along and clear things up.  
Yes! It is correct! So we can also think about the test-time training as "self-supervised" as there is no manual labeling process involved.

Weird that they picked video effects that you could pretty much do without any depth information...  
While I do agree that some (maybe most) of the effects are quite doable without depth information from the video, they still need depth information input from humans. And, of course, it's just a demonstration, a proof of concept. The paper is about machine learning and the method used after all, not about video effects.

Why does the hockey stick clip through the guy even in the low 15 FPS view? Surely that content should just be real frames right?  
I think they interpolated that clip from real footage, then de-interpolated down to 15 fps.  Why they did that, I have no clue.  
Because it makes the results look better. Any artifacts that are missing from the original interpolation are also missing from the de-interpolated “reference footage”, so the interpolated 60 FPS looks perfect. I’m weary of these results. Would love a demo website that we can upload other footage to and see how it works in general.  
Why does the hockey stick clip through the guy even in the low 15 FPS view? Surely that content should just be real frames right?  
Which hockey stick ? The stick carried by 17 Novak is simply rotated in this hands so it becomes side-on.

Github: https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2020-RIFE Our model can run 30+FPS for 2X 720p interpolation on a 2080Ti GPU. Currently our method supports 2X/4X interpolation for video, and multi-frame interpolation between a pair of images. Everyone is welcome to use this alpha version and make suggestions!

Now combine this with image upscaling, and we can stream movies at 480p @ 15fps, and have them upscaled to 4k at 120fps! And we can do the same for gaming too! Soon, yes, even your old dusty playstation 2, is going to be capable of 4k gaming! ... As long as the output is fed through 3 algorithms, frame rate increase -> image resolution upscale -> then a 'realism' AI image filter to the graphics to upgrade it. /jk-ish  
Is image upscaling really a thing? I mean, from 480p to 4k there're a lot of details the algorithm would need to "invent"  
Yes it’s a thing. It’s far from perfect but it does ‘work’ in some manner of speaking. You are right that you’re inventing detail, but hopefully statistically likely and locally plausible detail. Naturally there are ways to measure against real data various different ways in which these upscaling algorithms work and don’t work.  
I wouldn't say it is "inventing" detail, it is using information from previous and future frames to fill in some details. However, trying to go from 480p at a low framerate to 4k at a high framerate is not going to really look that great because you're trying to fill in too fine of details with too little data.

Google NVIDIA DLSS, something similar is being used in many video games right now.  
But dlss 1.0 which is real upscaling is quite bad. DLSS 2.0 is good but is more like TAA and requires motion vectors, something not available for video.

Jokes aside, there is a side of this that worries me. Algorithms are not magic. They cannot conjure up missing information, they have to inject information from outside the original data. Upscaling and video interpolation are mostly innocuous and valid applications. But if the technology starts to get used on things like security footage, it could give dodgy information a deceptive veneer of clarity. And that’s even before intentional deep-fakery. Not sure where I’m going with this. But yeah.

Tbh I was never a fan of 60fps. The only time I shoot 60fps is if I plan on reducing the speed. It is too smooth and clean that it no longer looks real. Our eyes catch it and you get "something is off" feeling  
Yet 60 fps is closer to the reality than 25 fps. I submit it is because you have used to 25 fps videos for your whole life. It could also have something to do with the effect called "uncanny valley".  
 Yet 60 fps is closer to the reality that 25 fps.  That's debatable. Our eyes actually see between 30 to 60 frames per second and that is an estimation. There is no real way to test the speed of the eye in relation to film because that's not the way our eyes are wired.   I submit it is because you have used to 25 fps video for your whole life.  While that is true for most people including me,, I'm a filmmaker and have been studying the fps debate since lord of the rings 48 fps spectacle. What we got is different theories and where our eye stands. To your point on the "uncanny valley", that hits it on the head. When I see something move fast with no motion blur it looks very fake to the point it is unnerving for me. Going back to the lord of the rings example, my class was split in half. Our result came to that it was a stylistic choice.  Side note: Gamers are a different bred where most games start at 60fps+. The psychology is different than filmmakers  
I mean the reality is like infinity FPS and 60 fps is closer to infinity than 25. What we feel of it in the eye may happen at some lower frequency, but then again people are easily able to distinguish between 30 fps game or 60 fps game.. No matter what digital processing tricks are used, in general case (but not in all cases, like slowly moving objects). Are people really able to distinguish between material that has been downsampled to 30 fps from 60 fps, instead of directly filmed to 30 fps? I suppose if it was just about motion blur then it would be easy to fix with some digital signal processing even preserving the frame rate.. and I have doubts it would do it. For example one comment I remember hearing is that the legs seemed to move "too quickly" in LoTR HFR, while, I imagine, the legs were moving at exactly the correct rate. Being a film maker you might be aware of the (old) idea of supporting variable frame rate in movies: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/siggraph-2012-douglas-trumbull-showscan-variable-frame-360410 . I imagine that would be best of both worlds. In particular I would enjoy experiencing the jarring 24 fps panorama scrolls in higher frame rate—although this is something that automatic interpolation handles well. In my opinion the bigger the change of frames in your field of view is, the worse the low frame rate feels. It also remains to be seen if the current gaming generation will also start to prefer higher frame rate videos due to exposure you mention—not just games, but Youtube also supports 60 fps. I have a 180 degree stereo VR camera and I feel 30 fps just doesn't cut it when putting the VR glasses on. In my case I need to choose between 5.6k/30 fps and 4k/60 fps and most often I choose the latter, even if the picture quality would be a bit better in the former.

At some level this is kind of interesting, but is it just me, or would it not have been much more interesting to show the ground truth image as well ? I may have missed it, if so I'm sorry, but from what I can see in the examples there are LR images being up-scaled, and then down-scaled again. As such, very cool, but depending on the algorithm used, the up-scaled images are in many cases very different. How interesting is it really to up-scale a LR image to something that doesn't look like the original image ? I want to see how close it is to the original image. ​ I mean, that would be interesting for images that are not this LR, but maybe just a bit better to actually make them somewhat usable.  
Yeah, I think you're looking at the work from the wrong angle.  They're specifically not attempting to recreate the original. They discuss it in the introduction, particularly towards the end of it.  
Yeah okay, I just scimmed through the paper. I'm not that much into imaging, in particular this. But I just don't see a use case for this ? I mean, what is the idea of up-scaling a LR image, if the up-scaling is not even close to what it is supposed to look like ? As I said, it would make sense if the LR image are not that low as in this case, but in these examples I really can't see the benefit ?  But maybe that is in regards to more advanced use cases...  
At some level this is kind of interesting, but is it just me, or would it not have been much more interesting to show the ground truth image as well ?

 I want to see how close it is to the original image  Lots of information is missing in down-scaled image. There's no way to restore the original image.

anyone know how accurate is this model? Can we generate the real brad pitt from pixlated brad pitt  
Here's a far more important question: take a photo of Brad Pitt and downsample it to 32 x 32 or whatever the above pictures were. Now, tell me: what's the full space of all high res images that could have been downsampled to produce the same picture of Brad Pitt? Put another way: sin(pi/2) = 1. There are MANY values that have a sin of 1, so how are you supposed to figure out sin-1 (1)? There's no sensible way to say you've matched the ground truth, because there are effectively an infinite number of possible ground truths. You can't really talk about 'accuracy' with a model like this in a rigorous sense, because there's too much information that's being lost. At best you're coming up with one plausible answer of many possible ones. The inverse sin of 1 could certainly have been pi/2. If that's what your model predicts, don't get upset that it didn't guess 5pi/2 instead, it had no way of knowing which was the original. As long as it upscales to someone that looks believably like the super low res Brad Pitt picture, that's as good as you can expect. This problem is fundamentally unsolvable in the way you're wanting.  
Inverse pigeonhole principle!  
Yeah, the 'official' math term if you're interested, is 'fibers'. For non-injective functions, you can potentially have multiple inputs leading to the same output. That means each element of the output space has whole subsets for the inverse... all those subsets make a partition of the input space. The elements of that partition are the so-called 'fibers'. the fiber of sin-1 (1) for example is {2kpi + pi/2 | k in Z}, so there's countably infinite possible inputs to get 1. The same is true for an extreme downsampling function like in this one... there's maybe not an infinite number of images that could lead to a given low-res image, but they're still some pretty large fibers, haha. To get a sense of how bad the problem is, all you have to do is downsample a block of text to the point where it's completely unreadable, and then ask how many different english paragraphs (was it even English in the first place?) could have made that vaguely-text like pixelated blur. Can't reconstruct Faust from a few pixels. For anyone who cares, one interesting method to attempt to inverse non-injective functions is Bishop's mixture density networks. Basically you have multiple networks in a mixture model, that together hopefully learn the various elements of the various fibers. Bishop's paper starts with learning to write the letter 'S' for example... Any given horizontal value in the letter might cut through a few different lines, since S doubles back on itself, so that's part of how the MDN-RNN handwriting synthesis paper from 2013 tackled this problem of multiple values in the inverse function (to name a fairly well known example).

Does it read the transcript and summarize it ?  
More than likely. I've done something similar before, it would just grab the links to the videos on the page, go to the pages, grab the transcript, then use that to get useful information.  
Last time I checked, YouTube transcript often misunderstood some specific technical terms(for videos like programming tutorials). They should train a model to extract those terms from the video description or text on screen.

Dumb question: how are you using InstructGPT? To my knowledge, the OpenAI RL-based GPT series models weren't directly consumable unless you were basically scraping the APIs from their web apps.  
A few months ago they've made some of those models available using the api, there is a massive difference in their ability to follow instructions. They're planning to add ChatGPT to the api as well, but for now I'm using "instruct curie" to make api calls cheaper  
Is the"instruct curie" doing a decent enough job? I saw such a massive drop off in instruct ability from davinci-003 to curie-001.  
I've noticed the same dropoff, but doing this kind of thing with davinci would be too expensive for me

Can you share some details of the dataset & architecture? How many trainings did you do before you settled on this model?  
To be honest this is built on top of pre-existing models. It uses the ImageNet 16384 model for the images. Then I've built on the VQGAN+CLIP notebook that Katherine Crowson made with some modifications.  
That was probably not intentional, but I think it would be nicer if you gave credit when you use existing work, e.g. on your twitter page, especially if that seems to be the main part of your bot.

And the "results are 0.x% better" papers are often about challenges that aren't interesting anymore since many years.  
Also do l don't forget, no ablation study so that it's impossible to know which of the tiny changes actually helped.  
This. Using a single "lego block" would be an improvement.  
And the "results are 0.x% better" papers are often about challenges that aren't interesting anymore since many years.  
Most of them are really just CV padding to some 1st or 2nd year grad student. If you look into them more, it's usually just as trivial as being the first to publish a paper about using a model that came out 12 months ago on a less common dataset. It's really more about the grad student's advisor doing them a solid in terms of building their CV than actually adding useful literature to the world.

I did not think this could get worse, but here we are.  
Apparently Siraj found the time to learn group theory, topology, and quantum mechanics while making his YouTube "content". I aspire to be just like him!  I will also need later the fact that if C is an arbitrary  orthogonal matrix, then C ⊕ C is both orthogonal and  symplectic. Importantly, the intersection of the  symplectic and orthogonal groups on 2N dimensions is  isomorphic to the unitary group on N dimensions. This  isomorphism allows us to perform the transformations  via the unitary action of passive linear optical  interferometers. Every Gaussian transformation on N  modes (Eq. (7)) can be decomposed into a CV circuit  containing only the basic gates mentioned above.  Errr hold on a moment. This is just a ctrl-C ctrl-V with a s/We/I/g. Even the equation numbers are the same.  We will also need later the fact that if C is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix, then C ⊕C is both orthogonal and symplectic. Importantly, the intersection of the symplectic and orthogonal groups on 2N dimensions is isomorphic to the unitary group on N dimensions. This isomorphism allows us to perform the transformations Ki via the unitary action of passive linear optical interferometers. Every Gaussian transformation on N modes (Eq. (7)) can be decomposed into a CV circuit containing only the basic gates mentioned above.   
Lol, changing the proper form of publishing to his more egocentric form makes this even worse  
It is ridiculous in this case, but there's not really anything wrong with using "I" if only you did the research. People who say otherwise are just blindly following outmoded dogma. Like people who put two spaces after a full stop, or who say "an historic".

He changed the we's to I's, Jesus Xhrist wtf. This is suicide.  
From my experience as an undergraduate, when I would write proofs or work on projects, I was always supposed to use "we" in the proofs or projects, even if I was doing all of the work.  I think that "I" is too presumptuous.  Is this accurate? For example,  "in this section, we prove that A != B".  
"We" in that case is the author and the reader. Kinda like academic conversational tone, "Now we see that foo implies bar."  
If you were to refer to yourself, you'd use "The author"/"The authors"

Using "we" is seen as more inclusive, since it's as if you are including the reader with you in the process, which in turn makes the writing sound less self-centred and presumptuous.

The equations in his paper are also kind of low resolution, which suggests that he literally copied and pasted them from the original paper (i.e. couldn't be bothered to write them out in latex himself). Really shocking plagiarism, can we collectively shun him yet?  
His paper also has two Figure 1's, the second of which (on page 8) is clearly low resolution scan from the original paper. I didn't think he was that stupid!  
The thing is this isn't a paper for the scientific community, but simply for marketing.  The target audience just want to click, read a few (to them) incomprehensible words and go "wow he's so smart, I will pay him $x to help me". The'll never see 2 figure 1s, and wont get to page 8. It's smart.  
Totally true, this paper was pure marketing. But it still surprises me that he is so dumb to have thought that this was a good idea. If there is something the scientific community never forgets is plagiarism. All the AI researchers who care about their reputation (ie. everyone) will stay away from him from now on, which means he won't be able to use the reputation of a network to sell himself as an expert and get invitations to events, podcasts, conferences, etc. Not a smart strategy, he's doomed.

It really makes me cringe, this reminds me of the people in undergrad who would put together assignment submissions by taking screenshots from books and the crops would have awful aspect ratios, poor resolution or JPG compression artifacts, be off center, etc. Then they'd write the equations in Google Docs/MS Word equation editor.

I was very skeptical about him after I watched a couple of his YouTube video. Especially, his live coding session was disappointing. I didn’t understand how he struggled a basic usage of Python. Now I think my skepticism on him seems to be legit.  
Yes.  I watched  this video on generating pokemon using a neural network.  I thought it was neat, and so I went to GitHub to check out the repository.  However, at the very bottom of the README, he says that all of the code was written by someone else, and that he was simply providing a wrapper around the code.  After that, I unsubscribed from his channel.  I doubt he has a solid understanding of the things he talks about and only profits from other peoples'  work.

From http://vixra.org/why  It is inevitable that viXra will therefore contain e-prints that many scientists will consider clearly wrong and unscientific. However, it will also be a repository for new ideas that the scientific establishment is not currently willing to consider.  Élite venue.  
There have been joke papers on arxiv before. There’s no peer review either, how would it not be considered?

Leave this whole scam on side!  The scam these days on internet starts with “Machine learning without Math”. And nobody sold it better than Siraj “The God of Scam” Raval.  Let’s be honest - There is no machine learning in the real world without the involvement of mathematics and it is a scam to sell it without mathematics and fool people.  Not everybody is supposed to learn what machine learning is about. However, we can educate people on what it does through talks etc.  Selling it to students “without mathematics” is a scam. It does not help. Period.

Jason Antic, the author of the "Deoldify" algorithm (https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify) chimed in his thoughts too.  As someone who recently went through his own experience with someone plagiarizing his work (https://twitter.com/citnaj/status/1167674349916176384), this hits home hard:  https://twitter.com/citnaj/status/1183242014751510529

Wow I was not expecting to get a reply from you!  Yeah I thought what happened to you was a travesty.  I can't believe those folks had the audacity to put you as an equal contributor to the first author.  Seriously, wtf.  Either way, I really love your work.  I've used it to restore some old photos that my grandfather took from Vietnam.  You don't really appreciate the true essence of a black and white photo until you restore its colour.  On behalf of the ML community, thanks so much!

Can you change the plagiarised paper to original paper? Sightly misleading. When I initially read that I thought killoran copied siraj.

His response to this: https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1183419901920235520?s=19  I’ve seen claims that my Neural Qubit paper was partly plagiarized. This is true & I apologize. I made the vid & paper in 1 week to align w/ my “2 vids/week” schedule. I hoped to inspire others to research. Moving forward, I’ll slow down & being more thoughtful about my output

Latest tweet: "Despite a breadth of online course options in 2019, many students still take on big loans to pay for college tuitions. Colleges could reduce these costs & maintain quality with AI i.e 24/7 chatbot teaching assistants, automatic grading, content generation, & retention monitoring"  
 automatic grading  Some things shouldn't be put in the hands of a machine. Also, the solution to the loan situation is free (yes, in the sense of taxpayer paid) tertiary education, but that's a debate for another day.

Now I think the claim to listen Bhagavad Gita at 3.0x speed is also false. Did anyone watched his latest livestream? He addressed the scandal & dismissed the acquisitions very lightly saying he overlooked the 500 limit because he was busy educating.

[D] An example of machine learning bias on popular. Is this specific case a problem? Thoughts?
This is a good example of language models learning shallow heuristics. The model has learned that in English certain pronouns are likely to come before certain words, and as per the example upthread in Turkish, it will even break consistency for this.  Bias like this is a particularly good example of how language models can learn to "cheat" on problems like this. A human translator would use "they", ask for clarification, or infer from other context rather than just guess based on what it's seen before.  Microsoft released a paper a bit ago about math word problems and identified a similar issue with language models learning shallow heuristics.

 A human translator would use "they", ask for clarification, or infer from other context rather than just guess based on what it's seen before.  But there isn't any clarification or context. This is a real-world problem that many translation companies face when they're handed a pile of completely disconnected strings from a piece of software. Yes, you could use "they" because you don't know, but more often than not, they'll end up using "he" or "she" as seems appropriate to the single sentence or fragment they've been given and let the customer tell them that it's wrong. (my experience) So you really can't say the ML is doing a bad job, here, when it's coming up with similar answers to the human. At worst, you can say that if this is all one string input then it should have been consistent within the string.

(my experience)  Isn't this essentially "ask for clarification?" At least it's the same in terms of both being "rely on human feedback" so that's not an option. A human translator who couldn't rely on human feedback needs a different solution.  So you really can't say the ML is doing a bad job, here, when it's coming up with similar answers to the human.  If the customer would say it's wrong to a human translator, does the ML model coming up with the same wrong answer not also count as wrong?

Turkish is similar. The pronoun "o" is used for he/she/it. "O güzeldir. O zekidir. O okur. O bulaşıkları yıkar. O öğretir. O yemek yapar..." is translated as "He is beautiful. He is clever. He reads. He washes the dishes. He teaches. He cooks...". I don't know if the selection is arbitrary but apparently the male domination in the translation is a result of a consistency constraint. I tried to translate individual sentences and saw both the feminine version and the masculine one for any sentence (e.g., Both "She is beautiful" and "He is beautiful") with a warning about genders. I also tried with random combinations of sentences. When there are at least two sentences, it always chose "he" (As in the example I gave). Many different attempts, only one exception I observed: The texts which include "O bir hemşiredir" are translated to texts which include "She is a nurse" (For the individual sentence, it notices the gender-specific translation and provide both versions). The translation for "O bir hemşiredir. O bana iğne yaptı." is "She is a nurse. He gave me an injection". This is strange for me. Maybe the selection of "he" may not be arbitrary as it can even break the consistency constraint.

Has anybody discussed what would be the solution to this? Randomizing gender? Reversing the stereotype? Using some neutral pronoun? "Context" can't be an answer because, in cases such as these, there's no context

Well what would a professional translator do? I imagine they might give you a side note that the source is actually ambiguous in context and the limitations of English do not allow a precise translation thus you should interpret the translation accordingly. Languages imply a lot of cultural context, and that should be communicated as necessary.  
As someone who has done Japanese->English translation professionally, we almost never get a chance to leave notes like that for confirmation sadly. You go with what you're given 99% of the time. If gender cannot be determined, you use 'they'. I'm sure I could find this in our style guides somewhere.

"Ő" doesn't imply gender that means the gender is unknown. A professional translator might use "they". It is a non-gendered English pronoun that had been used for centuries.  Or more awkwardly would use "He or she".  Of course "they" raise an other problem because in some simple sentences "they" would imply plurality.  
What about using “it”? Or does that not really make sense in the Hungarian context?

Agreed, without context choosing the most likely outcome is IMHO the best option.  
Randomise according to estimated probability. Always choosing the most probable will intensify bias.

I think this might be in part an artifact of the way the experiment was conducted. Translating "ő szép. ő okos." does yield "she is beautiful. he is clever.", but translating the two sentences separately yields alerts that both he and she are possibilities. I haven't tried the remainder, but expect them to be similar. So what I think might be happening is that it's not too hard to get the model to note that both "he" and "she" fits here, but Google Translate silently picks what the model deems the most likely version for texts with more than one sentence. If that is the case, I think giving the Google Translate UI team some time to develop a better UI would go a long way. :)

The ideal outcome should be correctly identifying that the original pronouns are gender neutral, and therefore the translation should be, too. That just seems objectively the best option in this particular context-less case. How to actually go about doing that, and in particular whether there is a better way than manually encoding gender, is the hard question.  
So the translation for "ő szép" (he/she is beautiful) would be "they're beautiful"? Or is there some English gender neutral pronoun that is unambiguously singular? edit: Now that I read my post, perhaps "he/she"? lol  
They is also a gender neutral singular pronoun.  
So the translation for "ő szép" (he/she is beautiful) would be "they're beautiful"? Or is there some English gender neutral pronoun that is unambiguously singular? edit: Now that I read my post, perhaps "he/she"? lol  
Yes, "they." No, I don't think there is an unambiguously singular alternative in English. Given the absence of context, greater ambiguity is better than guessing.

This doesn’ make sense if you generalize. Example: English doesn’t gender objects by definite articles, but German, French, Spanish does. English just uses ‘the’ while Spanish uses ‘la’ and ‘el’. If you translate from English to Spanish the goal should NOT be to keep the English non-genderdness. My point: translations should follow actual language practice. So in the English-Hungarian case if ‘they’ reflects the language use it is an option, but always using it seems to eliminate the forms which in English is most common, i.e. using he or she.  
 So in the English-Hungarian case if ‘they’ reflects the language use it is an option, but always using it seems to eliminate the forms which in English is most common, i.e. using he or she.  You misunderstood me. I did not say that it should always use them. Only in "this particular context-less case." If it is clear from context what the gender of the person is, obviously it is fine to use a gendered pronoun.

Using they.  
It would lead to many ambiguities. Let's say that there's a sentence in Hungarian that could be translated to "They were talking about her/his plans". In your translation, it becomes, "They were talking about their plans". The "their" is ambiguous in the translation, even though it isn't in Hungarian. It's about tradeoffs, no solution is perfect (which doesn't mean the current solution is the best or that they're all equally defensible.)  
 "They were talking about her/his plans"  If I understood the linked discussion correctly this would not happen, as her/his/they is the same word in hungarian, with no extra information. If an extra word was added to say "the man's plans" or "the woman's plans", then there would be information to transfer, but otherwise, the sentence you write simply would not exist to be translated in hungarian.

If there’s no gendered pronouns, then ‘they were talking about their plans,’ is correct. Also I presume sentences are structured to give context. If they’re not then yes, it’s not ideal but it’s the best trade off. You could use mx or Ze/Hir some kinda neopronoun would proudly how to approach it in English if you have to have it not be they/them.

The conundrum you're facing is that you're looking for a solution that treats political biases as data biases.  The solution is to stop equating political biases with data biases.  They're not the same, and cannot be solved the same way. Here's a thought experiment for context.  Let's say you have a hypothetical language where pronouns denote eye color, and another language where eye color is not part of pronouns.  Brown eyes are significantly more common than any other color other than in small pockets of strongly homogeneous cultures in specific countries.  This is an empirical fact.  When translating to/from the eye-color language, you're almost always going to get the brown eye pronouns... EXCEPT when you're talking about specific contexts that relate to cultural differences.  So without additional context, "O eats the food" is more likely to translate to "Brownie foodum eatum" over "Bluey foodum eatum", while "O eats the pickled herring" is far more likely to translate to "Bluey herringpicklum eatum" than a Brownie doing the same. If you come in here saying this is eyecolorist, the problem isn't data bias.  It's that you have a political bias that doesn't match objective reality.  Let's take something a little more real-world though... When I was a toddler and my dad was away, my mom dragged me to a quilt show.  When there, the women easily outnumber men 100:1 or more.  From a probabilistic model absent any other context, "she sews" is statistically orders of magnitude more likely than "he sews".  This is an empirically replicable and objective fact.  Acting like "O [sews]" is not very likely female... that's political bias, not data bias. Here's why it matters.  The way to solve data bias is to acquire MORE data that's MORE representative of reality.  It's why the face-morphing models that are trained on white faces will morph black faces to have white facial features.  We fix that data bias by including MORE data to better fit the training data to reality (namely, more people of all races). But political biases ALWAYS do the opposite.  This is because there's no amount of additionally representative data that makes "O [sews]" any less female.  Instead, political biases depend on censorship.  First they censor outputs, and when that doesn't work (because it never will), they try to censor inputs.  And that always fails in the long run too. At that point, that's not a problem in ML, and not a problem in the data.  It's a problem in your political biases.  The solution is that your political biases need to change.

what's the pasta source? anyway, here's my reply to another post: "I personally don't think it's a big deal, but if customers are complaining, it's a problem! Google already does a lot of work to reduce "algorithmic bias", I'm sure they will look at this too. Yes, biases are often good heuristics. But that's irrelevant, right? We're not asking Google "make an optimal prediction about the gender of the person who's being referred in this sentence", we're just asking it to translate something. If there is a way to translate without making assumptions, then it should do so. It would be awkward if Google started saying people were right handed when that's not included in the original (but assuming people are right handed is a good heuristic)."  
[removed]  
Has anybody discussed what would be the solution to this? Randomizing gender? Reversing the stereotype? Using some neutral pronoun? "Context" can't be an answer because, in cases such as these, there's no context  
I believe the correct pronoun is ”they” but people are not comfortable using it.

Gender Bias in ML is definitely a rising, serious issue, and it is something that is being actively researched by lots of people, including the Google themselves. This looks like the decoder for English has gender bias in terms of actions/roles. But the comments saying "just modify few codes so the pronouns are always they/them" like it is a rule based model makes me cringe. Large amounts of people there seem to not know anything about Neural Networks and Machine Translation in general. I mean... I wish people at least watch some YouTube videos about the topic instead of shaming ML engineers for "being too stupid to change few lines of code".

I admit I'm fairly new to ML, and could be considered as one who knows nothing, but what if we simy change the training data? I'm thinking along the lines of some regex magic to change he and she to he/she, and then surely the net would not learn any bias? At the cost of being utterly nongenderspecific of course.... Or just go wild and expose it to both he and she cases and see what pops out?

It seems like it’s just used examples of what it has seen the most in the training data.  
Well, i believe this is a good definiton of bias. :) edit: guys i believe there is some confusion about the theme. It is not really fresh in my mind, we should all check something about the Bias-Variance trade-off

Isn't bias supposed to be an unjustified predisposition towards a certain answer?  
Yes, but the scope and implications of the justification must be considered. "It learned from the data it was given" is a good justification of why it behaved this way, but not a good justification of why it should behave this way.

I don't know if you're making a joke and I'm whooshing, but even if you are, not everyone might get it. The gender preference may be statistically justified, but it is not justified as a societal norm. Societal norms (at least in mainstream media and politics) prescribe gender equality, and any linguistic preference for one over the other would be considered a normative bias.  The reason why it is important to discuss this is that real, existing inequalities that we are trying to fight politically are perpetuated by these normatively biased (but statistically representative) models.  Gender preference for household chores are still a mild example for the shitshow that is waiting to happen if this is left undebated.

A bias is when your model doesn't reflect the label distribution of the "population", in this case the corpus. Are you saying a full frequency analysis of these phrases on the whole corpus wouldn't turn out with the same probability argmax on "she" vs "he"?  
The corpus population doesn't necessarily match a real life population, since it wasn't gathered with that goal in mind. And training doesn't necessarily match the corpus exactly here since this is not the purpose of the model.

Except English does have gender neutral pronouns. There's no need to guess when there is a 100% correct translation possible.  
E: deleted the original comment seeking clarification of which gender neutral pronouns were being inferred, and deleted all follow up comments.  I asked a question with genuine curiosity, not with an agenda.

It gets more fun: Put "Παίζει μουσική" (plays music). Male.  Put "Μεγαλώνει δύο παιδάκια" (raising two children). Female.  ;) It's got some bias in there too don't worry.  Or more exotic: Του έριξε μπουνιά (punched him) but τον χαστούκισε (slapped him). See the difference? According to GTranslate men punch but women slap 😂

Well it is a problem, but not because the computer is making an assumption but because it's not making the same assumption everywhere, which means that the model doesn't use enough context on what it is actually doing and gives too much weight on what it learned. It's hard to remove these biases because humans could have the same biases, and algorithms aren't necessary superior to what they copy. Though the algorithm isn't supposed to leak biases this way. After the first guess, the algorithm should stick with that guess. But of course engineers working on these models don't understand every languages they translate, they can't fix all issues for all languages, and if the training set doesn't give to the algorithm the information that it is supposed to keep the first guess for the whole translation, it's hard to engineer/hardcode a model that'll be able to guarantee this behavior. And of course all of that is even worse if there are explicit biases that forbid the model from knowing it has to do one unique guess. It would be the case here if all these sentences were simultaneously written and translated exactly like that somewhere (It's probably not the case) And you can also use some NLP datasets with genders to process these biases but it's hard to have engineers and datasets to do that for all languages.  
I’m not sure if the consistency of the guess is the problem. NLP allows for that variety, esp in long paragraphs. When this presents as a consistency in the dataset, the model is bound to overlearn. Concur with everything else.  
If I had to translate that, at least I would stay consistent with my first choice. So I'm saying it's the problem just because I think a NLP model can learn that and because that's what I would do. The model can have this variety but I guess it should have learned that it's not supposed to use that variety in a context with a lot of similar sentences. But that's also an opinion on how to translate things. Usually if you make one guess, you'll want to stick to that guess for coherence. I think models can learn to do that with a good dataset. Maybe some people would have translated that by making a guess for each sentence, and maybe it makes more sense to do that for this language in which case I would be wrong.

So I guess I'm just going to go out on a limb and say that yes, this is a problem and it needs to be solved. While harmless in this case, doing little more than offend people who don't understand whats going on or don't care, the fact that the AI we're dropping into the world has this kind of unexpected behavior, much of which is far more subtle than what we see here, is a serious issue that is going to need to be solved. Sometimes AI researchers will talk about theoretical stamp-collecting strong AI that collects stamps at the expense of normal human values like "don't enslave the entire human race and force them spend all their time producing stamps." These were theoretical problems, but we have here a real-world example of that. These algorithms are optimizing for the data and the goals we gave them and they don't understand and aren't programmed to understand human moral and social values. As a result, we are releasing ML into the wild which violates society's values and we don't have any way to stop or prevent this from happening, yet the problem are only going to get worse and the consequences more severe. So yes, we need to figure this out. We don't have a solution and right now its still silly, inconsequential problems, but this does represent a very serious unsolved issue.

How would anyone translate that passage. You would need to ultimately substitute a gender in there, either way you go you applying a bias. You cant provide something imperfect information and expect a result that fits your world belief. Not one can fabricate accurate data in an absence of any meaningful context. For instance if I give you the word "Cat" and tell you make a sentence from it, you come back with something about the milk or cuddles or internet pics. I then get all triggered cause I was talking about a Lion and your feline prejudice is why society is collapsing and is responsible for every injustice that ever existed. I am not saying that AI bias does not exist, but it is a function of the specific design. We do not have  generalised AI yet, and most applications are built fit for purpose. Cleary this product was not designed to magically infer context. And I assure you, gender bias is the least of Google Translates issues.

Not saying bias is not a problem, it is, but to point out, there is a difference between saying that one person typically does something (ie in the literature) and saying that someone should do something (because of a perceived societal role).  The moment someone says "See, this is evidence that women are suited to these tasks, and therefore, it is right to have this expectation" then that is the problem. It's not the data itself it's the justification for discrimination.

This is just a mildly irritating and sad nothingburger.  There are many ethical concerns to do with ML and "bias" is the least of them, but somehow it gets all the attention. For example, as far as I know Google is secretly working with the government on providing AI solutions to the military, even though they publicly announced that they'll stop. So let's be real: this is only trending because these sort of topics are popular within culture wars. It's cheap outrage over something that's ultimately inconsequential. This is the result I see when I type just one of these expressions in. Not so bad, isn't it? Now it's a UI problem - how to inform the user gender ambiguity with longer text inputs without cluttering the UI. Google clearly opted for disabling the feature informing about ambiguity in favour of letting the model do its thing. And last but not least, the text used in this meme is itself pretty biased, considering that you can also get these results: ő gyilkos = he is a killer ő erőszaktevő = he is a rapist ő tolvaj = he is a thief I don't think I need to name the bias in the meme.   
Your first argument is nonsense. It's fine to be concerned about multiple aspects at once.  
Bias in AI can be a real problem, but it appears to me that most people researching it are wasting time asking/answering the wrong question. The real question isn't whether an AI algorithm is biased (to which the answer is, unsurprisingly, almost always yes); it's whether the AI algorithm is more or less biased than a human doing the same job. Because if the algorithm is less biased than humans, then problem solved - we should be rushing to jump on the algorithm as quickly as possible. But I haven't seen any research that actually does that. They just point out that an algorithm is biased and call it a day. That's because leaving your computer and interacting with other people to set up a human study as a control is tough work. Much easier to write a short python script that gives you a number with no baseline to compare to and let the media whip themselves in a frenzy and link to your arXiv preprint because bias > 0 and p < 0.05.  
 But I haven't seen any research that actually does that.  Most research that does this is published in CHI or other UX-related conferences where researchers work to understand how algorithmic process compare to human processes. Also, you can find research like this in domain-specific journals (i.e. criminal justice journals where researchers want to understand how judges uses algorithmic risk assessment score in their sentencing decisions). If you're looking only at publications in NeurIPS or ICML-type venues, you're not going to come across these papers because most ML researchers are trained on how to conduct the semi-structured interviews needed to complete this kind of research.  
Your first argument is nonsense. It's fine to be concerned about multiple aspects at once.  
Sure, because we all have an infinite pool of attention and emotional capability to care. In fact human empathy infallibly extends to billions of others humans, no matter where on the planet do they live. Right? Wrong. If we are even a bit serious about tackling a set of problems the first thing we do with them is prioritize, and then assign available resources accordingly. However, if all we want to do is give people the impression that we're virtuous and caring then we won't even bother doing that.  
The sad part is humans are not rational beings. We also tend to pick advocacies that are easier to digest and participate (in the end it's all just a marketing strategy). Given the current situation, people have been emotionally drained for the past year. We can expect people to be more apathetic with all the empathy fatigue especially when it seems like it's a few degrees away from directly affecting them. Btw, I have nothing against your message. In fact, I 100% agree that the discussion should revolve on stronger issues like Project Maven. I might be a bit cynical, but I think not unless, it evolves into an issue where people can directly associate the harm, that's the only time people will start caring.

You think that bias is less of a problem than military AI but that's just your opinion. I personally think that military AI is like drone vs manned aircraft. It's cheaper, safer and comfortable for the pilot but there is no difference for the guy getting bombed. I doubt the are building skynet and it's probably some image processing or other boring task.

 There are many ethical concerns to do with ML and "bias" is the least of them  How is bias so unimportant? I would think this would be one of the largest issues. I saw one video where a company was pricing health insurance from if someone was born a certain day of the week. It's easy for a model to easily pick up very bad biases. (or even illegal discrimination)  If you're working on a problem that will determine the quality of life of another person, then you should be worried with eliminating biases. edit: Here was the video  
There are simply many more important concerns regarding AI. Automating warfare is one; autonomous killer machines will not blow the whistle on war crimes and it will become impossible to counter warmongering politicians with concerns about soldiers' lives. Automating jobs without any consideration for the labourers is another, double emphasis on the part in italics. Automating labour can lead to great things, but in the end AI is just a tool and it can also lead to disastrous outcomes if used irresponsibly. The currently dominating school of economic thought does not at all dictate concern for people dispossessed of their source of income, quite the opposite. AI being applied to the data illegally harvested by rogue intelligence agencies is yet another concern that is more important than bias. Edward Snowden's leaks revealed deep corruption and unaccountability within the intelligence community, and the system has not changed for the better. AI being applied for narrative control in operations similar to those of Cambridge Analytica is yet another. You talk of AI pricing health insurance, but in this case health insurance companies could use AI to make sure that Medicare For All never happens. Bias is just something that Western culture is currently obsessed about. Sure, it's a problem in AI, but as with everything it needs to be viewed in context. In fact I'd say we are overly biased towards bias and that it's time to correct our neural networks.  
 Automating warfare is one; autonomous killer machines will not blow the whistle on war crimes and it will become impossible to counter warmongering politicians with concerns about soldiers' lives.  I think everyone is very aware of the issues with automating warfare. This has been a leading reason Google has resisted working with the government. (and even when they were, I think it was mostly in relation to defense)   Automating jobs without any consideration for the labourers is another, double emphasis on the part in italics. Automating labour can lead to great things, but in the end AI is just a tool and it can also lead to disastrous outcomes if used irresponsibly. The currently dominating school of economic thought does not at all dictate concern for people dispossessed of their source of income, quite the opposite.  This isn't really much of an ethical concern for engineers and researchers. Awareness is raised all the time for this problem, but holding back automation is a dumb solution. (I even saw in one state, a union was trying to get legislation passed that would limit the amount of self checkouts because it was eliminating workers. Why not just petition an automation tax for their workers? Why the seriously counterproductive policies instead?)   AI being applied to the data illegally harvested by rogue intelligence agencies is yet another concern that is more important than bias. Edward Snowden's leaks revealed deep corruption and unaccountability within the intelligence community, and the system has not changed for the better.  The majority of people practicing in machine learning are not working on datasets collected by secret agencies. This is pretty insignificant to what actual machine learning engineers and researchers should be concerned with beyond raising awareness to the issue and trying to get legislation passed to combat this. This is much like the war example used.  AI being applied for narrative control in operations similar to those of Cambridge Analytica is yet another. You talk of AI pricing health insurance, but in this case health insurance companies could use AI to make sure that Medicare For All never happens.  Again, this is a serious issue, though, most engineers are researchers are dealing with bias much more frequently than some conspiracy to influence elections.  Bias is just something that Western culture is currently obsessed about. Sure, it's a problem in AI, but as with everything it needs to be viewed in context. In fact I'd say we are overly biased towards bias and that it's time to correct our neural networks.  No, it's one of the most common issues in machine learning that people often ignore which results in lawsuits that can lose companies millions of dollars. (and cause all kinds of harm) There's a lot of people that do not care about the harm that they may cause. (so I still don't see how bias in unimportant)

Any machine model is biased by definition. The process of training is a direct act of biasing. Without biasing there is no machine learning.  
There are many sorts of bias. This is not the kind of bias we want to acquire in training. (I don't speak for my employer)

However, when you give it like 10 sentences, it's impossible to do so from a UI perspective. ​ EDIT: Here is a picture showing the behavior I'm talking about: https://ibb.co/pf00C49

My guess is it's just an n-gram frequency issue, not some deep seated case of discrimination.  
Most n-gram frequency "issues" occur because the issue is present in the language that people actually use. In this case, it's relatively well-known that our society has some set of expectations when it comes to assuming a gender for a job; those expectations are clearly reflected in the co-occurrence probabilities. Whether or not the expectations have a causal relationship with the discrimination in our society is not the point of my comment, (although it seems to be the general consensus that it is so), but that the two cannot be easily separated as your comment may suggest.  
You're talking PC nonsense.  N-gram frequency issue has nothing to do with societal expectations. It simply reflects the fact that some genders are more likely to do different things. Funny how we never hear PC nuts complaining how "he is a garbageman" is sexist. Or how such model would assume that males are thieves and rapists. It only applies when he is <something desirable>. All in all this is not a an issue at all, it's just another opportunity for low IQ PC acolytes to insert themselves into a discussion they know nothing about to signal their superior virtues.  
The only statement that naturally follows from the statement that 'a specific gendered word is more likely to be used within a certain distance away from a specific occupation,' (which, if I'm not mistaken, is the definition of n-gram frequency) is that 'the users of the language more often than not use that gendered word with that specific occupation.' Your assertion that  n-gram frequency issue simply reflects the fact that some genders are more likely to do different things  digresses from the aforementioned point, which does not assume anything about the relationship between the language people use and the actual gender distribution for each occupation. ​ Regarding this issue, I mentioned that "it's relatively well-known that our society has some set of expectations when it comes to assuming a gender for a job", because language does not accurately reflect real world data. The discrepancies could come from incorrect real-world observations based on personal biases, gendered words used in gender-neutral contexts for lack of a better word, social expectations reflected in fiction, etc. etc. As stated above, this has nothing to do with whether or not these expectations have a causal relationship with discrimination, nor the lack or existence of political correctness which you seem to abhor.

After all my work on pronoun resolution I figured I'd run this by my program, but it picked "language" as the referent of "it", regarding "processing" as a relative clause indicating what natural language is doing. Is there a linguistic reason to assume such constructs are compound words if the computer has never heard of it, or is that just a matter of rote learning? (CoreNLP does consider it a compound word)   On a related note: The second Winograd Schema Challenge was held a few weeks ago, so we may see some progress on pronoun disambiguation when the results are published.

 Is there a linguistic reason to assume such constructs are compound words if the computer has never heard of it  I just stumbled onto this sub randomly, and I have zero expertise in any computational field, but I do know that the original text is mildly ungrammatical: a hyphen is needed between "natural" and "language." (NLP is the processing of natural language, not a particularly natural kind of language processing.) This is a rule that seems to be seldom taught, and so I notice that hyphen omissions are ubiquitous in all forms of writing — though especially STEM writing, for some reason — but, to my knowledge, all major style guides still explicitly require a hyphen between the components of a compound modifier. If a hyphen were present, would your program still get the meaning wrong?

But language is organic, and especially with the explosion of jargon this century nobody anywhere is using hyphens for compound words and terms. It's either just two words, or remove the space, or portmanteau. That being the case, it's the style guides that are actually out of date and NLP needs to be prepared to leapfrog ahead of that. Input will come from laypeople, not from scholars or pedants so we have to know our audience. :o  
Good points. However, if the major publishers still use punctuation in a certain way, then NLP should at least be capable of parsing writing with that style of punctuation. A program could use context to disambiguate hyphenless compounds and make use of the hyphen rule for hyphenated ones, right? If OP's parser failed to give the correct interpretation with the hyphen present, that would seem to be an easily avoidable problem.

That's a very good question and probably hard to answer without further experiments and highly depends on the task. GPT-3 certainly is much better than our approach at generating long sequences of text (e.g., summarization or machine translation).

Hi there, sorry for the late reply, I haven't been checking out reddit for a while. We have not yet investigated whether (or how) PET works for token-level classification tasks like NER (as opposed to sequence-level classification), but I think this is a very interesting area for future work!  
Matching GPT-3's performance with just 0.1% of its parameters
Thanks for the very interesting paper and for being willing to answer qn on Reddit! I have a qn abt Section 3.1: 1) "maximum number of tokens required to express any output in Y" - Is this just the maximum number of tokens that the encoder can input (e.g, 128 in BERT). and eq(4) with the l(x) being masked out, is equivalent to just LM without any tokens as context? (MASK throughout).   2) Could you clarify what is being compared at In Table 1; GPT3 scores are based on few-shot priming (no gradient steps taken), whereas PET is based on few-shot learning on 32 examples? (gradient step taken on every example)?

Great, I think I've interacted with your course in some capacity before. Not sure whether it was via this sub or from Google search directly. One question, considering how the field of NLP or AI in general is making leaps and bounds of progress on scale of months. How are you planning to keep it updated and structure it so that your effort maintains its value for a longer course of time?  
Natural Language Processing Demystified (full course release, no sign-up required)
Very cool, curious, what do you get out of building a free course? Just personal exposure? (sorry, this sounds cynical, but I'm sure you have other things going on in your life not on a computer)  
Nah, I think that question makes sense. The motivation changed over time from signaling to building a network to just proving to myself I can ship something hard. I have a history of half-finished projects. This is the first big thing I've ever shipped. It was really challenging and there were multiple plateaus. But now it's out there and I now trust myself that I can build and ship future projects.  
Well, congratulations. I'm definitely in the same, half-finished projects boats.  So yeah, I understand how much of a triumph it is to actually get something out the door. Anyway, I've cloned your repo and started working my way through your videos. Looks great, I'm looking forward to seeing all of it.  
Thank you. Let me know if I can help with anything.

So, it looks like you are using spaCy for your NLP processing - which is a new libarary to me. - How do basic nlp tasks in spaCy differ from nltk and why did you choose spaCy? - Does spaCy do the more advanced, transformer based processing like the huggingface libriaries? Since I'm not at that part of the course yet, what do you use there and why? I'm just trying to get a sense of why you made the choices you did, so I know what reasons to use one library vs another for my own projects.  
IMO, spaCy offers a superior API and is designed for industry use. It lets you do a specific set of tasks that are common in NLP apps (PoS-tagging, NER, etc). NLTK is more of a general string processing library for academic exploration. Because the course focuses on getting NLP-related things done, I went with spaCy.   Yes, spaCy offers transformer-based pipelines that wraps the HuggingFace transformers library. https://spacy.io/usage/v3#features-transformers  I use spaCy mostly in part one. In part two, I switch to mostly Tensorflow/Keras/Hugging Face because: 1) There's sizable coverage of neural networks in general that is independent of NLP. 2) I wanted to show people a variety of tools.

Do you have the data somewhere? I’ve been building an RNN language model would be fun to try it out :)  
I removed the links that look like (text)[link] and one-word comments, but there is still some preprocessing to be done like removing "plain-text" links, reducing the autism with absurd amounts of emojis/exclamation points, and replacing \n, \t, double spaces, etc. Oh and bold/italic *'s. But here is like 3098638 "words" and 90194 distinct "words". https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OKVWE3V6g4-DvPNsiZ5yNizteqSitvLc/view?usp=sharing

People, I hear you, but I think you need to get over it!  Being interested in language processing you should all know that natural language is full of ambiguity, there's no way around it. Usually, context helps to disambiguate, but it's hard to provide context when you only have three letters. You might think of the other NLP whatever you want, but there is no inherent right for one concept or field to be given privilege and right to use an acronym just because it's more serious or scientific or whatever criterion of worth you use. I think we just have to accept the fact that NLP on its own is not the best search term and maybe not the best name for a subreddit either. And that's probably how alternatives like nlproc have arisen.  
Anyone else now and then feel irked that r/NLP belongs to the pseudosciences?
I only learned of the embarrassing other meaning when someone almost mistook what I was talking about. I actually have a bigger issue with the poor choices of AI jargon in general, in this case the "Natural" part of "Language Processing", because human language doesn't come naturally, nor does the field cover languages of other natural animals. The field should just be called "language processing" since human languages are the default assumption.  
The distinction in linguistics is between "natural" languages of humans and the "artificial" languages of computers.  Also most linguists will say animals have communication and not language itself.  So that's a bit of context where the term comes from. Language processing seems very vague.

Was literally just looking for more info on this after someone posted about it earlier. Looking forward to reading! Any word yet on explainability options and other test suite functionality re: bias, etc.?  
afaik there's no utils to help w/ that yet  
Got it, thanks! Do you also have a good sense yet for the minimum use-able document length? Like are we talking paragraphs (which was my sense from traditional LDA and the newer STM methods a lot of social scientists use) or does it still work suitably on documents of only a sentence or two?  
BERTopic is the future of topic modeling in NLP
This is cool, but because semantics is my specialty I have to ask: What in the world scale are you using to quantify “meaningful vector representations of text?” I know you don’t have a rule-based Peircean layer in your transformer, so how are you getting this and how are you quantifying it?  
As it's your speciality you will likely have a more specific definition for this than I. For me, it depends on the use case, but from a generic but practical pov, I need pairs of sentences/Q&A/etc that are similar in meaning to be placed nearby in a vector space. To quantify that the correct pairs are being identified, a dataset containing pairs like STS, SQuAD can be used and we test retrieval performance with a metric like MRR@k or nDCG@k

A Python library to boost T5 models speed up to 5x & reduce the model size by 3x.
A Python library to boost T5 models speed up to 5x & reduce the model size by 3x.
Is the a knowledge distillation technique like tinybert?  
no, it exports PyTorch T5 models to onnx and runs on onnxruntime.  
Thanks. Took a look at this while I was in line today, so good to know about this. Your application looks focused on the fine-tuning stage, but apart from quantizing, onnx looks to bring improvements to pretraining to?

If there is a notebook not on your site, but I believe to be helpful (I didn’t make it either), how would I approach this?

Thank you for your work. The "Keras Overview" link does not work anymore because of an update on the tensorflow repo.

Nearly 200 NLP Datasets Found Here!
I can point you to a few more from Twitter that you can add (if you are still adding to the database)  
That would be awesome! i'll give you a shot-out on Twitter if you want after. If you have any non-English datasets it would be great too!  
From the top of my head... there are a few I am missing (will add them later). Thanks for this service to the research community. Thanks for the Twitter shoutout too :). Multiple datasets from SMM4H shared tasks: https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/25/10/1274/5113021 https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-3203.pdf https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5904.pdf Corpus for Evidence-based medicine (text summarization, text classification etc.): https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-015-9327-2 Word2Vec models for health/drug-related social media (No annotated data): https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dwr4xn8kcv/3  
Thank you, will make my first update on the weekend after next. My resources got crushed because of the database. Btw, what is your Twitter handle for when I retweet?

How ChatGPT actually works
I really liked this post of Yao Fu, Hao Peng and Tushar Shot, How does GPT Obtain its Ability? Tracing Emergent Abilities of Language Models to their Sources.  
How ChatGPT actually works
Thanks for this!  Will have a close read when I get a chance.  Chat GPT seems like a giant leap forward. I’m very surprised at how well it works.

Can I find a job in NLP outside of ethically-questionable Big Tech companies?
So many opportunities. Lots of ethical nonprofits and startups use NLP to counterbalance the negative influence of big tech: tangibleai.com There are wellness apps and cognitive assistants like mindcurrent.com and literally 800+ companies proposing apps and platforms to the Schmidt Futures Tools Competition (most using NLP). Lots of companies and foundations using NLP at Anthropology+Tech conference going on right now in London. Plus smart cities like Amsterdam and Helsinki just passed laws that require all AI algorithms employed by governments be auditable and transparent.

Healthcare (lots of NLP on health records), Fintech for models for credit scoring, business data like sales, marketing, customer support, etc. Lots of opportunities. Chatbots using a mixture of rules and NLP are being used and widely deployed in many industries.

I specifically for this specific reason started my career by doing NLP in Healthcare, it’s very challenging than ads.  The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.  – Jeffrey Hammerbacher

Maybe the sarcasm is flying over my head but Grammarly is regarded by many as a glorified key-logger that also happens to do grammar corrections. It goes against everything that OP stands for  
It also reinforces all kinds of insidious prescriptive attitudes about language, and I would argue is harmful to nonstandard dialects.

Google is really pretty good about privacy and design ethics, not perfect, but probably among the best of any company with significant data. Tristan Harris got his start because his presentation and ideas were popular within Google, after all. And there are a wide variety of roles, extending to pretty prosocial things like education and open source research and tools.  
I'd dispute this, and I suspect this is exactly the kind of ethically questionable organization OP wants to avoid. Google is no Facebook, but it is a "surveillance capitalism" corporation. Moreover, more than half of their workforce are temps, contractors, or employed by third party vendor companies. These workers are paid a fraction of what their full time employee counterparts make, receive lesser benefits, have no job security, and many of them do the same work as FTEs.

Maybe not much better than FANG but comcast has some open NLP positions atm  
Can I find a job in NLP outside of ethically-questionable Big Tech companies?
You’ll have to create your own dept at non large companies like the guy in Madmen that created tv marketing. Most businesses that are very large corporations, aren’t even going to have divisions or even know what NLP is/the capabilities of it. You have leverage to literally work anywhere, as long as you can illustrate to decision makers how your skills can help that specific company grow  
This isn't quite true. Most large corporations definitely have data scientists including linguists, even if their work isn't public facing. I have a friend doing NLP for a large industrial manufacturing company. He works on things like analyzing maintenance records to tag each mention of a part with its specific model number.

Given how little intelligence your post betrays (you have come to this conclusion based off of a highly sensationalized documentary without thinking very deeply about it, and you think you’d end up fine-tuning sentiment analysis models for engagement), you are probably not smart enough to work for FAANGs anyway. I suppose ethics is a good excuse for “explaining away” that fact, so yeah.. To answer your question: there are very many good employers in this space beyond bigger corps. Have you looked at non-profits, or perhaps news media like the Guardian/Economist with excellent data science depts, or startups? A simple Google, oh sorry I mean DuckDuckGo, search will do wonders.
